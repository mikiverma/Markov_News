Nikki Waller, global management editor of The Wall Street Journal, discussed hiring and developing workers with Lori Goler, global head of people at Facebook Inc., and Juliet de Baubigny, a senior partner at venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Edited excerpts follow.\n\nMS. WALLER: Lori, let\u2019s pretend I\u2019m a 22-year-old engineering whiz. What does it take to keep me happy right now?\n\nMS. GOLER: It\u2019s the same for all generations. It isn\u2019t particularly about the people who are just coming out of school. What we see a lot of is the importance of pride. They are looking for the sense of fulfillment\u2014having an impact, being part of something that\u2019s bigger than you are, learning. People really want to learn. The most important thing is actually playing to your strengths. So it\u2019s the notion of doing not just something you\u2019re good at, but something you love.\n\nMS. WALLER: Juliet, tell me about the startup hiring pipeline. What motivates people to join some of the early-stage companies you advise?\n\nMS. DE BAUBIGNY: The desire to be an entrepreneur is really significant. So many people start their career saying, \u201cI can be the next Mark Zuckerberg. \u201d And they have such iconic people to look to that are inspiring them to at least try.\n\nIt is also important that they can look to other growth organizations, even a larger iconic company to go and get the best set of experiences.\n\nWhat people are really looking for is flexibility. How can I really learn, grow, develop and have a flexible set of experiences? Because if you look at this and you look at the young workforce, 21% of millennials are looking for another job. And most are changing jobs at a far more rapid pace than any of us did.\n\nSo, as you look at investing in people, the days of hanging on to your great talent for a decade are largely over, or should be questioned. The question is, \u201cWhat can I really invest and get out of that person for the time that they are with me?\u201d\n\nMS. WALLER: So how do employers compete?\n\nMS. DE BAUBIGNY: It goes back to creating an environment where you can have a higher purpose and an impact in your work. It puts more pressure on managers and leaders in large companies to be really connected with their organizations to ensure the employees are getting that.\n\nThe other two big drivers, particularly for young people today, are compensation, also transparency. This is a values-based generation. They really want to understand the values of the company that they\u2019re working for.\n\nFlexible Facebook\n\nMS. WALLER: How is flexibility playing out at Facebook?\n\nMS. GOLER: Flexibility is a really important part of the way that we work at Facebook. We\u2019re results-focused and results-oriented. It came about in the early days, 13 years ago. It\u2019s the way engineers like to work. They like to work in the hours that they want to work. Sometimes they start late. They stay late. Whatever it might be. They\u2019re just there to get their work done. And actually that works for everybody. So, at Facebook you have your goal, what you\u2019re supposed to be delivering, and that\u2019s how your manager assesses how well you\u2019re doing.\n\nIt worked really well for the early engineers, but it also works great for families. I have three kids. Flexibility is fantastic for me.\n\nJuliet de Baubigny and Lori Goler talk about hiring practices for a more diverse workplace.\n\nI know what I have to deliver. I know what I\u2019m responsible for. No one is paying attention to when I\u2019m at my desk, where I\u2019m doing it from, how it\u2019s getting done.\n\nMS. DE BAUBIGNY: The days of a performance review, I would submit, are largely over on an annual basis.\n\nMS. WALLER: Everybody here agree with that? They\u2019re all nodding their head.\n\nMS. DE BAUBIGNY: Because for the young worker, they want immediate feedback. They want to know where are they going? Where are they delivering in their results? So, yes, maybe having the annual performance review. But most millennials value a weekly feedback, a monthly feedback, a quarterly feedback cycle.\n\nSo what that means is that you\u2019ve got workforces that value flexibility. That\u2019s a bigger retention tool that I think large companies can also do.\n\nBut that flexibility then needs to be embedded in the culture.\n\nBuilders wanted\n\nMS. WALLER: Lori, when your team is recruiting someone who is really top talent, and they don\u2019t choose Facebook, where are they going instead?\n\nMS. GOLER: They\u2019re starting their own companies, usually, if they\u2019re really top people.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for builders. We\u2019re looking for people who can look at any situation and think, \u201cThat works pretty well. I bet it can be even better, and I have a vision for how to make it better.\u201d\n\nLORI GOLER | \u2018I know what I\u2019m responsible for. No one is paying attention to when I\u2019m at my desk, where I\u2019m doing it from, how it\u2019s getting done.\u2019 Photo: Nikki Ritcher/Dow Jones\n\nA lot of the people who come to us are people who have already started things or have already built something on the side, or already have an app or whatever it might be. So, you know, I think that that passion for doing something new and different is alive and well.\n\nMS. WALLER: What are some of the emerging places you are starting to look for talent?\n\nMS. DE BAUBIGNY: I am very touched by this incredible entrepreneur in Berlin.\n\nHe\u2019s an Indian immigrant. He started his company GoEuro four years ago. He flew to Berlin, because it was a low-cost center to build a company. He didn\u2019t speak a word of German, and four years later he has a growth company that we\u2019ve just invested in proudly. And 50% of the engineers are women.\n\nI am intrigued by Los Angeles as a market. Austin. Berlin. And then, obviously, different parts of the globe.\n\nMS. WALLER: Where else are you finding people right now?\n\nMS. GOLER: Really we look everywhere. We hire from more than 300 schools.\n\nMS. WALLER: Juliet, talk a little bit about the mind-set that people have when starting companies, and how you\u2019re working to advise some of these firms to bring in diversity from day one.\n\nMS. DE BAUBIGNY: I hope three years from now, when Lori and I are back here doing this panel together, we won\u2019t even have to have this discussion because this has been solved.\n\nHaving said that, we just have to keep working at this from day one. Companies that do not have diversity and inclusion policies will not be competitive. That\u2019s it.\n\nJULIET DE BAUBIGNY | \u2018The days of a performance review, I would submit, are largely over on an annual basis.\u2019 Photo: Nikki Ritcher/Dow Jones\n\nI was talking to one exceptional woman who was going to join the senior leadership team of a company, and her first question to me was, \u201cWhat is the board\u2019s view on diversity and inclusion? What is the leadership team?\u201d\n\nI think as people are making hiring decisions, they\u2019re looking at the composition of boards, executive leadership team, senior leadership team, and the entry hiring pool. And they are making their hiring decision based on that.\n\nEncouraging diversity\n\nMS. WALLER: How is Facebook helping to advance people with diverse backgrounds, diverse ways of thinking?\n\nMS. GOLER: Things change when you measure them. So, to the extent that the executive team is on air about it, clearly cares about it, is talking to the teams about it, and you\u2019re measuring it, things do start to change.\n\nMS. WALLER: Lori, you say that Facebook has one question that reveals a lot about a hire\u2019s fit and motivations. Tell us about that.\n\nMS. GOLER: My favorite question to ask is always, \u201cOn your very best day at work when you go home and you think, \u2018I have the best job on the planet,\u2019 what did you do that day?\u201d Because I want to be sure that whatever job or role the person is coming into is something that has a lot of whatever that is in it. That is how you get someone to play to their strengths from the very beginning.\n\nMS. WALLER: Juliet, what kind of mind-set are you looking for?\n\nMS. DE BAUBIGNY: For a startup environment, it\u2019s all about mental agility. Because you\u2019re in an environment where everything is sort of at a precarious point, whether it\u2019s product development, financing, distribution or management. So, being able, so mentally agile, to be able to flip between those different functional sectors, and then to be able to have some good perspective.\n\nWrite to reports@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "What Tech Employees Want"}
{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-artificial-intelligence-will-change-everything-1488856320", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Andrew Ng and Neil Jacobstein talk about the types of jobs that could be replaced with AI in the near future.\n\nArtificial intelligence is shaping up as the next industrial revolution, poised to rapidly reinvent business, the global economy and how people work and interact with each other.\n\nAndrew Ng, chief scientist at Chinese internet giant Baidu Inc. and co-founder of education startup Coursera, and Neil Jacobstein, chair of the artificial intelligence and robotics department at Silicon Valley think tank Singularity University, sat down with The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Scott Austin to discuss AI\u2019s opportunities and challenges.\n\nHere are edited excerpts.\n\nMR. AUSTIN: Andrew, there\u2019s a lot going on with artificial intelligence. What is Baidu focused on?\n\nMR. NG: For large enterprises like Baidu, AI creates two big pockets of opportunities. One is our core business. Web search, advertising\u2014all of that is powered by AI today. For example, we run a very large food-delivery service, and when you order food, we use AI to predict how long the food will take to get to you. That includes deciding which motorcyclist to dispatch to pick up the food, so they arrive just as the food is cooked and fresh, and they can get it to your door while it\u2019s as hot as possible.\n\nIn addition to strengthening our core business, AI is creating a lot of new opportunities. Just as about 100 years ago electrification changed every single major industry, I think we\u2019re in the phase where AI will change pretty much every major industry.\n\nSo part of my work at Baidu is to systematically explore new verticals. We have built up an autonomous driving unit. We have a conversational computer, similar to Amazon \u2019s Alexa and Google Home. And we\u2019re systematically pursuing new industries where we think we can build an AI team to create and capture value.\n\nMR. AUSTIN: Let\u2019s talk about speech recognition. I believe someone in your program has said that the hope is to get to the point where it is 99% accurate. Where are you on that?\n\nAndrew Ng says improvements in speech recognition could make its use far more common.\n\nMR. NG: A couple of years ago, we started betting heavily on speech recognition because we felt that it was on the cusp of being so accurate that you would use it all the time. And the difference between speech recognition that is 95% accurate, which is where we were several years ago, versus 99% accuracy isn\u2019t just an incremental improvement.\n\nIt\u2019s the difference between you barely using it, like a couple of years ago, versus you using it all the time and not even thinking about it. At Baidu we have passed the knee of that adoption curve. Over the past year, we\u2019ve seen about 100% year-to-year growth in the daily active use of speech recognition across our assets, and we project that this will continue to grow.\n\nIn a few years everyone will be using speech recognition. It will feel natural. You\u2019ll soon forget what it was like before you could talk to computers.\n\nMR. AUSTIN: Neil, at Singularity what sort of trends are you seeing from an AI perspective?\n\nMR. JACOBSTEIN: Just since the beginning of 2017 we\u2019ve seen a team at Northwestern develop an AI that could solve the Raven Progressive Matrices Test, an intelligence test of visual and analogical reasoning, better than the average American.\n\nWe also have seen a team at Imperial College London develop an AI that could diagnose pulmonary hypertension better than cardiologists typically do. Cardiologists have about 60% accuracy. This system does 80% accuracy. And in January of this year, Tuomas Sandholm and Noam Brown from Carnegie Mellon University developed a poker player called Libratus, which beat four of the world champion poker players, and not by just a little bit. They played 120,000 hands of poker, and Libratus ended up with $1.77 million in poker chips. This is a big deal, because it signals the ability to deal with incomplete information and to deal with situations that require bluffing and an opponent that generates misinformation. That is a really important set of skills. It will lend itself to negotiation, to strategy development, and perhaps even to policy analysis.\n\nMR. AUSTIN: For decades there has been a cycle of hype and rapid progress and then you have an AI winter and it goes away. Does everyone agree it\u2019s different this time?\n\nMR. NG: Modern industries go through winter, winter, winter, and then eternal spring. I do think we\u2019re in the eternal spring phase of AI, because unlike the earlier waves of maybe overhype, today AI is creating tremendous value for firms like Baidu and Google.\n\nThis creates a very clear revenue stream with which to keep investing in and improving AI technology.\n\nJOHN BUSSEY: How might corporations that maybe haven\u2019t thought much about AI use it to augment their strategy right now?\n\nAndrew Ng discusses all the different parts of his company's business that are powered by AI.\n\nMR. NG: Right now, AI technology is this magical thing, right? It\u2019s useful for so many different things. But the reality is, AI technology needs a lot of customization for your business context.\n\nSo I recommend that business leaders hire a senior AI leader\u2014a chief AI officer or a VP\u2014to sort this out for them.\n\nRecruiting AI talent is so difficult that having a centralized AI function would be the best way to have consistent hiring and promotion and management standards for an AI team. This team can then work cross-functionally to figure out how to fit these technologies into your business.\n\nMR. JACOBSTEIN: I have a different perspective on this. I believe in the power of small, interdisciplinary teams that have support high up in the corporation. It\u2019s very important to match the speed of the technology with the nimbleness of the teams. And having a centralized AI guru at the top, where everybody has to ask questions of that person, is unlikely to be as fast and effective as having a decentralized organization with powerful teams, with real talent.\n\nOne second of thought\n\nMR. AUSTIN: Do you think almost any job can be automated? Early on, we were talking about manufacturing jobs, blue-collar jobs, truck drivers. Now we\u2019re talking about white-collar jobs.\n\nMR. NG: Things may change in the future, but one rule of thumb today is that almost anything that a typical person can do with less than one second of mental thought we can either now or in the very near future automate with AI.\n\nThis is a far cry from all work. But there are a lot of jobs that can be accomplished by stringing together many one-second tasks.\n\nNeil Jacobstein talks about some recent achievements where AIs have been able to solve complex problems.\n\nConsider a security guard monitoring security footage. They have a pretty complex job. But the job maybe can be broken down into a lot of smaller tasks, which involve one second of cognitive thinking. So a lot of the art and skill in figuring out where to insert AI is to recognize the business opportunities where you have a complex system but a lot of these one-second tasks that you might be able to string together automatically.\n\nMR. JACOBSTEIN: I think people are going to be surprised at how fast machine learning is going to displace routine jobs.\n\nMR. AUSTIN: How fast are we talking?\n\nMR. JACOBSTEIN: We\u2019re talking about a transition that\u2019s going to occur over the next 10 to 15 years that is really significant.\n\nFor that reason, we need to invest heavily in free education and explore various ways to provide a basic income [to those who are displaced].\n\nMR. NG: Just as AI will destroy jobs, it will create new jobs that we can\u2019t yet imagine. The challenge is the skills mismatch.\n\nMR. JACOBSTEIN: The good news is that AI and robotics are going to generate massive amounts of new wealth. Our responsibility is to make sure that in addition to having our companies be successful, people who get displaced have a reasonable quality of life.

ODG\u2019s founder, Ralph Osterhout, sat down with Wall Street Journal technology columnist Geoffrey Fowler to discuss how augmented-reality glasses work and what businesses might do with them.\n\nEdited excerpts follow.\n\nMR. FOWLER: So what exactly is this product?\n\nMR. OSTERHOUT: It\u2019s a high-speed computer on your head. Basically, it allows you to have photorealistic imagery anywhere, anytime. And most important, it can give you cloud access to anything.\n\nMR. FOWLER: Inside the glasses there are cameras in the front, small sensors and screens. Tell me about the technology.\n\nMR. OSTERHOUT: Inside you have two screens that essentially are photorealistic in terms of image quality. They adjust automatically to ambient conditions. You also have the lenses in front that either get dark or light, depending on the conditions around you, whether you are inside or out.\n\nMR. FOWLER: What can you see when you\u2019re wearing these glasses inside?\n\nMR. OSTERHOUT: You can watch movies. You can literally do almost anything, measure anything, get any information from the Cloud anywhere 24/7.\n\nMR. FOWLER: Do you have to take Dramamine before putting smart glasses on?\n\nMR. OSTERHOUT: Not at all. You never get sick.\n\nMR. FOWLER: Why not?\n\nMR. OSTERHOUT: It\u2019s pure physics. You have an occipital lobe that governs sight, and you have your temporal lobe governing hearing, and as long as your brain understands that your imagery and sensations coming into your brain are in sync, you don\u2019t get sick.\n\nEverybody says, \u201cOh, well, it\u2019s all about latency,\u201d [the delay between what you see and your body\u2019s motion]. It isn\u2019t, because when you were a child in the back of a car reading a magazine or a book and your parents are going straight, you didn\u2019t get sick. When they went around curves, you got sick. Now, here\u2019s the interesting thing: If it was latency, how do you explain the fact there is no latency in the printed page? It isn\u2019t about latency. It\u2019s about disconnection between two sensor inputs in two places of the brain.\n\nMR. FOWLER: How are businesses using these?\n\nMR. OSTERHOUT: The huge applications that are killers are telemaintenance, telepresence, telerepair. Being able to see anything anywhere and understand what it is.\n\nFor example, we were at Pepsi\u2019s headquarters, and Pepsi got a call that their big German facility went down. They have multiple banks of machines, and when one of those machines goes down, it costs $1 million a day.\n\nThey had bought glasses, so they told the guys in Germany to turn them on. That allowed Pepsi\u2019s people in the U.S. to see what the engineer in Germany was seeing when he went out on the line to investigate. The guys in the U.S. could say: \u201cWhat you need to do is reset the breakers. Do this.\u201d They could give instructions because they could see what [the engineer] was seeing halfway around the world in real-time. That\u2019s killer.\n\nMR. FOWLER: And they\u2019re being used in surgery, as well?\n\nMR. OSTERHOUT: All of the major hospitals\u2014Cleveland Clinic. Johns Hopkins, Stanford, UCSF\u2014are asking about them because you can do amazing things with them.\n\nTake lower-back surgery. From the time the patient is prepped, it\u2019s typically a 30- to 45-minute procedure. And whether it\u2019s a herniated disc or something else, you\u2019re bone scraping and resetting the area around the nerves that are emanating from the particular vertebrae in question.\n\nWith this technology\u2014and lighting and stereo cameras above\u2014they can go in and do the procedure guided by a computer. They can literally see CT scans and MRIs superimposed. They can cut the procedure time\u2014you won\u2019t believe it, but it\u2019s going to be published\u2014to 30 to 45 seconds from 30 to 45 minutes.\n\nWrite to reports@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "How Augmented-Reality Glasses Work for Business"}
{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-digital-transformations-are-hard-1488856200", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Bernard Tyson talks about the difficulties of taking his company's medical records digital.\n\nWhen a company decides to change its IT infrastructure, it can be a headache for everybody. Jobs from the executive suite to the assembly line can be affected. And it can be difficult getting all of the stakeholders to buy in.\n\nJust how difficult was one of the topics Jason Dean, The Wall Street Journal global technology editor, discussed with Bernard Tyson, chairman and CEO of Kaiser Permanente, the big health-care provider based in Oakland, Calif., and Jeanne Ross, a principal research scientist at the MIT Sloan Center for Information Systems Research. Edited excerpts follow.\n\nMR. DEAN: Bernard, you\u2019ve done a lot of work in this area, digitizing medical records and expanding the use of telemedicine at Kaiser Permanente. What was the biggest challenge you encountered?\n\nMR. TYSON: People. Seriously. The biggest problem was our physicians had a bond with the patient. It was the personal touch, the personal voice, the personal phone call. The physician is the advocate of the patient. Then you have the nurses and others. And they had a way of working. There was a lot of concern about breaking that trusted relationship, a lot of questions as to whether or not it would really work in the health-care industry. It took a lot of buy-in, and conversations and engaging the physicians in particular but the other health-care workers, too. So ultimately it wasn\u2019t done to them. They were a part of it. But I would not kid you. It was extremely difficult.\n\nMR. DEAN: How long did it take to switch to electronic medical records?\n\nMR. TYSON: We\u2019ve been on the journey for at least 30-plus years. But once we went big time, which is the critical decision we made to go with Epic Systems, it took us about five years.\n\nMR. DEAN: Jeanne, you\u2019ve looked at a lot of industries, a lot of companies in different sectors. And you\u2019ve looked at Kaiser Permanente\u2019s experience up close. How does that challenge in bringing in the key stakeholders compare?\n\nMS. ROSS: Most companies should be grateful they don\u2019t have the physician challenge. But this idea of, \u201cI own something. I know what\u2019s best. I will do what\u2019s best for my customer and thus whatever it is you want me to share is probably a bad idea,\u201d that is really common until it\u2019s not, right? Until you say, \u201cOh my gosh. Look what I can do now.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s getting over the hump. We call it the operational backbone. Getting a backbone in place that gets your transactions smoothly through the system without you worrying about them and that gives you some transparency to some data you want. That is a really, really big thing. And today if you don\u2019t have that in place, you are behind the eight ball.\n\nGetting to yes\n\nMR. DEAN: How do you get the buy-in? By taking a small group and making them kind of a test or a pilot program? Or is it just a lot of meetings and education?\n\nMS. ROSS: There\u2019s no single formula. Usually you do need some thought leaders taking charge. It really is top-down, whereas the beauty of the leveraging with digital technologies later does not have to be top down. And that\u2019s why you get to the point where you say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s actually fun, and exciting and meaningful.\u201d\n\nJeanne Ross talks about some of the companywide policies organizations are putting in place to guide digital transformations.\n\nMR. DEAN: Bernard, what is the one thing you don\u2019t want to hear from the CIO?\n\nMR. TYSON: How great everything is going to be. There is a low tolerance for BS, right? That, \u201cOh, you just have to do this. Oh, you have to do that.\u201d No. It\u2019s hell, right? It\u2019s changing the world. Second is, \u201cIt\u2019s only going to cost X amount.\u201d It never only costs X amount. Third, I don\u2019t need a CIO to tell me, \u201cJust implement the technology, and you will force the transformation of the organization.\u201d We\u2019ve experienced that, and just the opposite happened.\n\nMR. DEAN: It seems like the CIO needs to be talking to all of the interest groups and making sure that he or she understands their needs and how to bring them on board.\n\nMS. ROSS: Yes, the role is very much a relationship-management role. With the introduction now of more digital technologies, whether we\u2019re talking AI or what I call SMACITs\u2014social, mobile, analytics, cloud and Internet of Things\u2014so many business people tell me they cannot get their heads around what\u2019s possible. So this is really, in most of the companies we\u2019re studying, IT-led.\n\nIt is a vision that IT is able to project mostly by redesigning IT into services or capabilities, letting business people recognize what kind of capabilities you\u2019re providing, and then basically following.\n\nUnwanted apps\n\nMR. DEAN: How do you deal with vendors or insiders who develop apps that they say can make the system better?\n\nMR. TYSON: When we were implementing the electronic health records, it was great because we built a discipline in the organization.\n\nBERNARD TYSON | \u2018Innovation that I can\u2019t scale doesn\u2019t serve the purpose of the big strategy that I\u2019m implementing.\u2019 Photo: Nikki Ritcher/Dow Jones\n\nNow, you fast forward to today. It\u2019s just the opposite. I travel all over the company. And somebody in a corner somewhere in the organization has written a special app, and they\u2019re pulling data, and they\u2019re doing all this creative work. But it may not be applicable to the rest of the organization.\n\nI want the innovation. But innovation that I can\u2019t scale doesn\u2019t serve the purpose of the big strategy that I\u2019m implementing. And so if we\u2019ve created a wonderful app that\u2019s doing great things for a segment of our population in Baltimore but I can\u2019t use it here in California, then I question the usefulness of it beyond that box over there in Baltimore. The system being used in essence frees people up to be creative. And you want that. But in my case I want it so I can leverage it across the program as opposed to just one particular area.\n\nMR. DEAN: Is there still broad concern that technology means loss of jobs?\n\nMR. TYSON: Yes. It\u2019s sort of the unfinished business. In our primary-care area last year, over half of our encounters were virtual. And this is over 100 million encounters; 52% of those were virtual.\n\nWrite to reports@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Why Digital Transformations Are Hard"}

(You still have some expenses: plane tickets, meals, local transportation, sightseeing, etc.)\n\nThe scary part, of course, is opening your home to total strangers. But several exchange services and their websites offer ample help: detailed information about swaps and how they work; instructions for drafting exchange agreements; messaging systems; and listings of thousands of homes in dozens of countries.\n\nAmong the services: HomeExchange.com; HomeLink International (homelink.org); Home Base Holidays (homebase-hols.com); and Intervac International (us.intervac-homeexchange.com).\n\nYes, home exchanges involve risks. Cancellations are among the largest. You have to prepare for the possibility that the other party will simply back out of the swap. (Here, travel insurance might help.) You will need to vet\u2014as thoroughly as possible\u2014the people who are moving into your home. References are a must, and home-exchange websites can tell you how many previous swaps, if any, your would-be visitors have had.\n\nAnd there is always the chance that your exchange partners might damage your home, your belongings or your vehicle, if the vehicle is part of the swap. Contact your insurance carrier, and, if need be, add riders to your home and auto insurance to cover temporary occupants.\n\nFinally, not all of us hail from San Francisco. You might live in a town or city that, to your thinking, might not be attractive to exchangers. Take heart. One exchanger we spoke with suggests spending some time with the websites mentioned above, finding your city (or the destination nearest you) and seeing how many exchangers there are.\n\nIn particular, check to see how many are veteran exchangers, which is a good sign that they have been successful in finding swaps. See how these homeowners are marketing your town or city on their home page. You might discover that your locale is more appealing than you think.\n\n***\n\nI have a 529 account for my nephew, and he has now graduated from college. There is about $15,000 left in the account, and I wonder if the rules allow for me to be the beneficiary. I would like to take a French language class before a trip I am planning to Europe. If allowed, what kind of program do I have to register for?\n\nYou have a few options here.\n\nFirst, yes: You can make yourself the beneficiary. The tax code permits changing the beneficiary in a 529 college-savings plan to a member of the family of the current beneficiary\u2014including aunts and uncles, says Mark Kantrowitz, a financial-aid specialist and publisher of Cappex.com, a college planning site.\n\nThe full list of family members includes: spouses, children, grandchildren, siblings (including stepsiblings), parents (including stepparents), grandparents, nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law and first cousins.\n\nAs far as a language class\u2026529 funds can be used for \u201cqualified\u201d higher-education expenses\u2014which include tuition, fees, books, supplies and equipment\u2014at an \u201celigible\u201d education institution. Such institutions must be eligible for Title IV student federal aid, which includes most accredited U.S. colleges and universities.\n\nJournal Report Podcast Subscribe to the Journal Report podcast at wsj.com, on iTunes or Google Play Music.\n\nSo, you should be able to use the 529 funds to enroll in a French language class, if it is offered by a Title IV college or university, Mr. Kantrowitz says. (And you don\u2019t have to be enrolled in a degree-seeking program.) It might also be possible to take the class in Europe, he adds, if the college there is Title IV eligible.\n\nTwo other options: Your nephew could use the money for graduate school. Or your nephew could take a \u201cnonqualified distribution\u201d (in other words, a withdrawal that isn\u2019t tied to education expenses), which will be taxed at his rate.\n\n***\n\nMy husband is collecting disability benefits from Social Security. Does that make me eligible to claim spousal benefits?\n\nHome exchanges involve risks. Cancellations are among the largest. Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nYes. Normally, a person becomes eligible for spousal benefits only after that person\u2019s spouse has claimed Social Security. But disability benefits\u2014even though they aren\u2019t \u201cretirement benefits\u201d (which are what most people receive from the Social Security Administration)\u2014also make a person eligible for spousal benefits.\n\nAs usual, there are some wrinkles. First, you must be at least 62 years old to file for benefits. (Unless you\u2019re caring for a child under age 16, in which case you become eligible at any age.) Second, you won\u2019t necessarily get a spousal benefit; rather, you will automatically receive the larger of two benefits: the spousal benefit or the one based on your work history, if you have one.\n\n***\n\nAnd speaking of Social Security\u2026\n\nI regularly hear from readers who are frustrated with the Social Security Administration and its services. Many of those complaints are certainly valid. But I must share a recent experience that my wife and I had at our local Social Security office.\n\nPREVIOUSLY IN ASK ENCORE\n\nWe walked in cold (no appointment) on a recent morning to iron out a problem with my wife\u2019s benefits. We were greeted by a person who asked about the reason for our visit, gave us a number and invited us to take a seat. About 40 minutes later, a second person reviewed our questions and paperwork. About 45 minutes after that, a third person\u2014one who specialized in our area of concern\u2014sat down with us and, in about 10 minutes, solved our problem. A few weeks later, we received a letter that accurately summarized what we had been told during our visit.\n\nIn other words, the system worked. And the three people who helped us were unfailingly polite and knowledgeable. Believe me: I know the Social Security Administration isn\u2019t perfect. I know the agency has problems. But it also has a lot of good people who do good work. And I just want to acknowledge that.\n\nMr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal.

Just don\u2019t make a habit of it. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nWhen it comes to saving for college, readers have many questions, especially about tax-advantaged \u201c529\u201d college-savings accounts, which allow money to grow tax-free in mutual funds if used for qualified higher-education expenses. We asked experts to help answer some of their queries.\n\n***\n\nShould I dip into my retirement account to pay for college?\n\nPeople do it, but most financial professionals advise against it. At the very least, experts say, you should limit such withdrawals, so as not to drain your savings. While you or your children can take out student loans, you can\u2019t borrow for your retirement. In the extreme, raiding your retirement funds to pay for college could mean running out of money in your later years\u2014and forcing your offspring to support you.\n\nAsk Us a Question Have a question about college finance in general? We\u2019ll be answering them in future funds reports. Send them to reports@wsj.com.\n\n\u201cIf you take out a significant portion of your 401(k) or IRA funds at an advanced age, you have less time to replenish, and if you come up short of funds at retirement, you have fewer options,\u201d says Stephen Williams, senior vice president and the head of U.S. financial planning at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.\n\nBecause the interest rate on student loans is usually lower than the long-term average annual return of the stock market, it\u2019s worth it to keep your money invested and have your children borrow for college, even if you later help them repay the loans, says David Royal, president of Thrivent Mutual Funds in Minneapolis.\n\nJournal Report Podcast Subscribe to the Journal Report podcast at wsj.com, on iTunes or Google Play Music.\n\n\u201cHelping your children with their college costs is a nice gesture if you can afford it, but you should likely not do it if it leaves you underfunded for your retirement years,\u201d he says.\n\nClients who raid their retirement plans to pay for college are potentially missing out on the magic of compounding, says BMO\u2019s Mr. Williams. More specifically, paying for four years of college in effect could set a retirement saver back six to 10 years or more in building their account value, depending on market conditions. Parents need to weigh that against their student having federal college loans at relatively low rates that can sometimes be deferred based on circumstances.\n\n***\n\nShould 529 money be invested in a target-date fund? If not, what is the best way to invest it?\n\nThere are two ways to think about this. Target-date funds\u2014mutual-fund portfolios that usually start out with a mix of stocks and bonds and gradually move toward all fixed income as the beneficiary approaches college age\u2014are easy: You pick one and never think about it again. That is good for people who don\u2019t want to do the research necessary to select funds for their 529, but not as good for those who prefer to have more control over their holdings.\n\n\u201cDecisions should be based on risk tolerance, holding period and the degree to which someone may wish to delegate the job of maintaining a portfolio allocation to a third party,\u201d says David Macauley, college-planning program manager at Thrivent.\n\nOne downside to target-date funds, says BMO\u2019s Mr. Williams, is that \u201cif you miss out on a bull market that occurs shortly before the child goes to college when you are almost 100% fixed income,\u201d you may wish you had more control rather than letting the target-date fund\u2019s automatic glide path take over. You also could be in the opposite situation of losing money while managing the 529 yourself, he notes.\n\n***\n\nAlthough we have had $350,000 in household income in recent years, next year our income will be under $40,000 due to retirement. I don\u2019t think the Fafsa (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) allows you to indicate extreme changes in circumstances. How can we get more aid for our two children, one in college and one in graduate school?\n\n\u201cIf your income situation changes drastically so that your income going forward looks very different than what is reflected on that applicable tax return for the Fafsa, you can reach out to the financial-aid office at your school to explain your new circumstances,\u201d Mr. Macauley says. Financial-aid officers are permitted to use their judgment when determining aid.\n\n***\n\nMy daughter is in a graduate program that for one semester requires her to work, unpaid, four days a week at an elementary school across town. She takes buses or Uber to get there. Are the transportation costs incurred considered qualified expenses for 529 withdrawals?\n\nNo. You can use 529 funds only for this short list of qualified expenses: tuition, room and board (if at least a half-time student), school fees, books, supplies and computers, Mr. Williams says. If you choose to use 529 money for these transportation costs, you\u2019ll have to pay income taxes on the earnings portion of the withdrawals, plus a 10% penalty.\n\n***\n\nIf the owner of a 529 plan benefiting a grandchild needs the money for their own medical expenses, are these withdrawals qualified or allowed without penalty?\n\nNo. You\u2019ll have to pay income tax on the gains portion of any money you withdraw, as well as a 10% penalty, Mr. Macauley says.\n\n***\n\nI work for a private college. My daughter will receive tuition remission and be able to attend the college free. Would the tuition remission be considered equivalent to a scholarship? In other words, may I withdraw an amount equal to the tuition remission each year from her 529 account and not have to pay the 10% penalty?\n\nPREVIOUS COLLEGE Q&A COLUMNS\n\nYes. Tuition remission is treated the same as a scholarship, Mr. Williams says. But although you are lucky not to have to pay her tuition, you\u2019ll still have to cover the rest of her college costs, many of which do qualify as legitimate 529 expenses, including room and board (if she\u2019s half-time or greater), books, supplies and computers. If there is money left over in the 529, you can direct it toward her graduate-school tuition, or change the beneficiary to any of her direct relatives and use the funds for their education without penalty, he says.\n\n***\n\nI am 10 years beyond retirement age. My longtime friend has a daughter in college who is a freshman with good grades, and I have been paying her full tuition. I am working to pay the tuition but would like to retire. My friend has no real assets and wouldn't be able to pay. Can we apply for aid even though her daughter is already at the college and we never applied for aid before?\n\nYes. Have your friend\u2019s daughter file a Fafsa, the federal student-aid form. It doesn\u2019t matter if this is her first time filing the form. In your situation, your friend\u2019s daughter should fill out the Fafsa using her parents\u2019 income and assets, and indicate your contributions to her education as \u201cother bills paid on my behalf.\u201d This money \u201cwill effectively be treated as untaxed income received by the student when calculating her eligibility for need-based aid,\u201d Mr. Macauley says.\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

But often they overlook the importance of discussing certain basic issues first. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nMy husband and I plan to retire in the next year or two, and we have heard the jokes about spouses suddenly spending all their time together and driving each other crazy. In all seriousness, how do couples deal with this? Is there a danger of too much togetherness in retirement? Any guidance? Any resources?\n\nIt is a valid concern. Many couples, obviously, enjoy later life immensely. But navigating the transition from work to retirement\u2014including the all-important issue of \u201ctogetherness\u201d\u2014can be difficult. Two suggestions:\n\nFirst, and as obvious as this might sound, spouses should tackle several fundamental questions about retirement well before they get there. Among them: Will we retire at the same time? (In a Fidelity Investments study published in 2015, fully half of surveyed couples disagreed on their exact retirement age.) What\u2019s our vision of later life? How do we plan to fill our days? How much do we wish to travel? Will one (or both) of us continue to work in some fashion? Where do we want to live? Do we want to downsize?\n\nFinancial advisers regularly find that couples don\u2019t address these issues. Many spouses mistakenly assume that their partners feel the same way they do about, say, travel; others simply dismiss potential troubles. After all, retirement seems \u201ceasy.\u201d What can be so difficult about \u201cnot working\u201d?\n\nSecond, consider the possibility of \u201cparallel play.\u201d Psychologist and author Maryanne Vandervelde uses the image of two children in a sandbox, each with their own toys. Chances are good that the toddlers are much more content than they would be if they were trying to play with the same toy.\n\nThis idea\u2014of two individuals engrossed in separate but parallel activities\u2014can work wonders in retirement. A wife and husband with individual and shared interests typically have a relationship with a good mix of freedom and involvement.\n\nBooks that can help: \u201cRetirement for Two,\u201d by Dr. Vandervelde; \u201cA Couple\u2019s Guide to Happy Retirement: For Better or for Worse\u2026but Not for Lunch,\u201d by Sara Yogev; and \u201cToo Much Togetherness: Surviving Retirement as a Couple,\u201d by Miriam Goodman.\n\n***\n\nI am approaching 70, still working full time and still contributing to my individual retirement account. Do I have to take a distribution at age 70\u00bd?\n\nYes, you must take your required distribution after reaching 70\u00bd, even though you\u2019re working. This rule applies to traditional IRAs and employer-sponsored IRAs, including SEP and Simple IRAs.\n\nThe only exception: Roth IRAs, where the original owner isn\u2019t required to withdraw funds, regardless of his or her age.\n\nNote: The rules involving required distributions and 401(k)s are somewhat different. If you\u2019re working, you might be able to delay required distributions from your 401(k) beyond 70\u00bd. Check the rules for your individual plan and, if you\u2019re brave, IRS Publication 575, \u201cPension and Annuity Income.\u201d\n\n***\n\nI established a donor-advised fund last year with a large mutual-fund company, contributed appreciated mutual-fund shares, and took a charitable deduction for the value of the shares. I intend to donate additional appreciated shares this year.\n\nWith end-of-year capital-gains distributions within my mutual funds approaching, is it possible to instruct that capital-gains distributions be sent directly to my donor-advised fund? Could I then avoid tax on those capital-gains distributions and claim a charitable deduction?\n\nIt isn\u2019t possible to donate only the capital-gains distribution, according to Karla Valas, managing director of the complex asset group for Fidelity Charitable, an independent public charity with a donor-advised-fund program. Technically, she explains, once the mutual-fund shares become \u201cpregnant with the distribution,\u201d you are liable for the tax consequences.\n\nMs. Valas suggests researching which funds may have a capital-gains distribution this year and then donating that fund before the record date of the distribution. By doing so, you avoid being taxed on the receipt of the capital gains.\n\nAlternatively, Ms. Valas adds, you could donate other appreciated mutual-fund shares to offset the tax liability on the capital-gains distribution received.

Most of the queries continue to be about \u201c529\u201d accounts, the state-sponsored plans that typically invest in mutual funds and allow college savings to grow tax-free.\n\nHow much can a grandparent contribute to a 529? Does it matter in which state I live, in which state my grandchildren live or in which state the 529 plan is based?\n\nLimits are the same no matter who\u2019s contributing to the 529. Each of these state-sponsored 529 plans has its own cap on the account\u2019s size, usually more than $250,000, says Angie O\u2019Leary, senior vice president at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.\n\nParents, grandparents and others contributing to 529s on behalf of a student usually try to stay within the annual gift-tax reporting exclusion, which is $14,000, or $28,000 for a couple, per beneficiary, she says. The 529 plans have a special tax advantage: You can front-load contributions five years at a time, allowing you to put in $70,000, or $140,000 per couple, all at once. However, you won\u2019t be able to give to the same beneficiary by contributing to a 529 or making any other gift for the following four years or you\u2019ll be liable for gift taxes.\n\nThe residency of grandparents or grandchildren has no bearing on 529 contributions; nearly all 529 plans are open to residents of any state and the plan\u2019s rules apply to all participants in the plan, regardless of residency, says Peg Creonte, senior vice president at Ascensus College Savings. It should be noted, however, that some states offer their residents tax benefits for contributions to an in-state 529, Ms. O\u2019Leary says.\n\nI am a grandfather of three and owner of a New York state 529 plan for each. When the eldest applies for college, does it make sense to transfer the balance in her account to the youngest, with plans to transfer back when she becomes a junior or senior in college, so as to show no 529 moneys when she applies for financial aid and to maximize aid when applying as a freshman?\n\nThere is no need to change beneficiaries, though the Internal Revenue Service allows it. The value of the 529 plan owned by a grandparent (or anyone other than a parent) isn\u2019t included as an asset on the Fafsa financial-aid application. When the student takes out money to pay for college expenses, that withdrawal counts as income on the following year\u2019s Fafsa. Starting with the 2017-18 academic year, the distributions from a 529 plan would be reported as student income two years after the money is used for college expenses, Ms. O\u2019Leary says. Student income, including 529 withdrawals, will typically reduce the amount of financial aid a student will receive.\n\n\u201dBecause of this treatment, some grandparents wait until the last years of college to withdraw money from a 529,\u201d Ms. Creonte says.\n\nI have 18-year-old twins about to start college in the fall, each with their own 529 account. One has a full scholarship, and the other has a small scholarship at an expensive college. If I want to use some, but not all, of the funds in my son\u2019s 529 account to help pay the expenses of his twin sister, how would I do that? Can I change the beneficiary of his account to include both him and his sister and then use as I deem appropriate? Then, in the future, if not all used for his sister, can I use the balance for his grad school?\n\nA 529 can have only one beneficiary, so your twins can\u2019t share an account. But you are allowed to switch the beneficiary to another member of the family at any time with no tax impact. As such, you may want to change the beneficiary on your son\u2019s account to your daughter, and use the account for her qualified educational expenses, says Ms. Creonte. If there is money left over in the account once you are done paying her expenses, you can always change the beneficiary back to your son and use the funds to pay for his qualified graduate-school expenses, she says.\n\nYour column said that when a beneficiary receives offsetting scholarships, the 10% penalty is waived when withdrawing unused 529 funds. Is a student\u2019s receipt and use of military dependent GI Bill money considered to be, for tax purposes, a scholarship, and therefore would the penalty be waived?\n\nVeterans\u2019 educational assistance isn\u2019t the same thing as a scholarship under the 529 rules. However, this type of government assistance does count as an exception to the 10% penalty, just as a scholarship would, Ms. O\u2019Leary says.\n\nIs it possible to fund 529 plans from a trust that is being distributed? Would the five-year contribution limitation still apply?\n\nYes. 529 accounts can be funded from trust distributions; in addition, many 529 plans also permit trusts to own the 529 account for the benefit of the named beneficiary, Ms. Creonte says. Check with your tax adviser about how your trust should use gift-tax exclusions, she suggests.\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nWhen planning for college expenses, tax-advantaged \u201c529\u201d accounts have been a popular savings tool. But readers are often unsure about the details. Questions about the state-sponsored plans, which typically invest in mutual funds, continue to dominate our college-finance mailbag. Here are experts\u2019 latest answers.\n\n***\n\nIf our only child receives a full scholarship, or we decide to not tap into his 529 for his undergraduate expenses, can we use it for grad school? Can we keep the account in his name and then will it to another beneficiary? Does it have to be liquidated at our death?\n\nYes, 529 funds can be used for graduate school. You can also change the beneficiary to any direct relative of the original beneficiary; this can be done at any time and doesn\u2019t need to be done through a will. And note that if your child receives a scholarship, you are permitted to withdraw that amount from a 529 without incurring penalties, though if the money isn\u2019t used for educational expenses, you pay income taxes on any earnings.\n\nIn terms of how ownership transfers fit into your estate plan, you\u2019ll want to consult an estate lawyer because 529 plans can have different rules on this. For some plans, you can designate a successor owner or contingent account holder. Upon death, ownership would transfer to that person, says Karen Wallace, a senior editor at fund researcher Morningstar.\n\nOne exception, she notes, is \u201cif the parents have made a five-year lump-sum contribution, which allows you to \u2018superfund\u2019 a 529 plan and avoid paying federal gift taxes if you spread the amount equally over five calendar years and complete IRS form 709 with your federal tax return in each of those five years.\u201d In that case, if the parents die before the end of that five-year period, there could be estate-tax consequences, she says.\n\n***\n\nIllustration: Dan Page\n\nMy daughter, age 28, has extra money in her 529 account because she received significant scholarship assistance during college. I did not know at that time that I could withdraw the amount of the scholarship from the 529 account without paying tax or penalty. Can I get it out tax- and penalty-free now, even though she graduated several years ago?\n\nScholarship withdrawals don\u2019t incur penalties but you do incur income taxes on any earnings. There is no requirement that you withdraw money from a 529 in the same year that you receive a scholarship, although it\u2019s a good idea, says Thomas Rowley, director of retirement and education strategies at Invesco. To be safe, though, since it is years later, check with the plan administrator to make sure you can still properly withdrawal the money and not pay the 10% penalty on any gains you earned.\n\n***\n\nI have eight grandchildren and as they reached grade school I started each of them with a 529 account, contributing $400 a month to each and increasing it to $1,000 a month during high school. I am listed on each of their college bursars\u2019 accounts as a person to share financial information, so that when the school notifies the student that a payment is due, I receive the same notification. Upon receipt I email Vanguard to sell enough of the investment to cover the cost and send the money to my bank. I then forward the money to the school. Is there anything wrong with my system?\n\nYou should check with your tax adviser on whether your reporting requirements are different if the check is made out to you or the school directly, says Ms. Wallace. Note, also, that \u201cschools receiving money from a [grandparent-owned] 529 plan may treat it in a way that has a big reduction on financial aid,\u201d she says. If your student has a chance at qualifying for financial aid, you may want to look into the best time to withdraw those 529 funds\u2014such as junior or senior year\u2014so as not to jeopardize any aid award the student might get.\n\n***\n\nInstead of using a 529 account, can a grandparent use the gift-tax exclusion to help grandchildren pay for college expenses? And if a grandparent pays college tuition and dorm costs directly to the university, am I correct that the money isn\u2019t considered a gift and isn\u2019t taxed?\n\nYes. You are allowed to give a grandchild (or anyone else) up to $14,000 a year without having to file the gift-tax\u200bform, and the child can use that money for college (although once the money is transferred, you lose control over how it is spent). You can also pay the school directly without gift tax kicking in, \u201calthough many schools consider this type of payment as student support, which can result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction in aid eligibility when the student applies for financial aid the next year,\u201d Mr. Rowley says.\n\nBe aware that the gift-tax exclusion for direct payments to colleges only covers tuition; withdrawals from 529s can also cover qualified educational expenses such as computers, room and board, and books, he says.\n\n\u201cA better solution may be to contribute to the student\u2019s 529 plan,\u201d which is assessed at a lower percentage than student income in the financial-aid calculation and therefore has a lower impact on aid reduction, Ms. Wallace says.\n\n***\n\nI\u2019ve read about waiting to withdraw money from a 529 until a student is a junior or senior, to better enable that student to qualify for grants. Where, then, do people expect to get the money for the first few years? Doesn\u2019t this tactic defeat the purpose of having a 529 at all?\n\nDon\u2019t fret, there generally is no need to wait. After all, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or Fafsa (used to determine need-based financial aid), considers both assets and income anyway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to realize that whether or not you withdraw the money from a 529 account that lists your child as a beneficiary, the money in the account will be counted as assets in the federal formula for student financial-aid eligibility,\u201d Mr. Rowley says. Parents\u2019 assets are counted at a 5.64% rate, students\u2019 at 20%, and grandparents\u2019 assets aren\u2019t counted at all, even if they hold 529 accounts with the student as the beneficiary.\n\nBut grandparent-owned accounts can be an issue, which is where that \u201cwaiting\u201d advice comes from: While money that comes out of a parent-owned 529 for educational expenses isn\u2019t considered student income for aid calculations, if a grandparent owns the account, 50% of withdrawals count as student income, which can affect aid. That\u2019s why experts suggest using parents\u2019 529s for the first few years of college, and grandparents\u2019 529s for later years.\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York. She can be reached at reports@wsj.com.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications:\n\nWithdrawals from a \u201c529\u201d college-savings plan that aren\u2019t for qualified educational purposes will incur income tax on any earnings, but if the withdrawal is because of offsetting scholarships the student received or other exemptions, there won\u2019t also be penalties. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that money taken out because of a scholarship will incur neither taxes nor penalties.

Photo: Stockphoto/Getty Images\n\nAs students turn in their college applications, questions about financial aid and tuition come to the fore. With the help of experts, we again answer readers\u2019 questions about \u201c529\u201d college-savings plans (tax-advantaged accounts that invest in mutual funds) and other ways to pay for college.\n\nIf I have money left in a 529, may I donate the assets to charity?\n\nWhile you may take a distribution from a 529 account for any reason, a gift to a charity isn\u2019t considered a qualified educational expense by the Internal Revenue Service, says Judy Ward, a senior financial planner for asset manager T. Rowe Price. Any earnings on your original 529 contribution that you withdraw for this purpose would be subject to income taxes, as well as a 10% penalty.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, it is also possible that your donation to charity will result in a tax deduction which may, to some extent, offset the taxes and penalty paid on the nonqualified withdrawal,\u201d says Paula Smith, senior vice president for defined-contribution and college savings at Voya Investment Management. Check with your tax adviser to see what your situation would be, she says.\n\nI set up 529 plans for my young granddaughters three years ago. The underlying funds in my plans have returned, on average, 11% a year, but my accounts show a total return of just 5%. Is it possible that 529 management fees have eaten up the other 6 percentage points?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say exactly why your performance doesn\u2019t match. You could be paying high upfront sales commissions to a financial adviser, a trade-off for lower continuing fees, known as shareholder-service fees, says Ms. Smith. That makes sense for a 529 investment, which is typically held for a long time, but it shouldn\u2019t account for a 6-percentage-point annual difference over three years, she says. Other fees, such as annual administration fees, might be eating into your returns.\n\nAsk Us a Question Have a question about college finance in general? We\u2019ll be answering them in future funds reports. Send them to reports@wsj.com.\n\nPREVIOUS COLLEGE Q&A COLUMNS\n\nAs for the funds themselves, it can be tough to compare the performance of the overall account with your investment in each specific fund.\n\n\u201cIf the allocation to one investment was increased before a period of poor performance, or another investment\u2019s allocation decreased before a period of positive performance, the 529 account as a whole would see differing returns than what would be expected by looking at the current allocation,\u201d Ms. Smith says.\n\nFees and performance matter, and if you feel your 529 isn\u2019t doing its part to maximize your granddaughters\u2019 college savings, you may be better off saving another way\u2014but you\u2019ll be giving up the significant tax advantages of a 529 if you do.\n\nIf I have a grandchild in another state, one that offers state-tax deductions for 529 contributions, does it make sense to give money to my children, the child\u2019s parents, to deposit in their 529 plan, so they can claim the deduction?\n\nWhile you certainly could do that, some grandparents prefer to open their own accounts so they can control the investments and distributions, Ms. Ward says. Note that if grandparents own the 529 assets, these funds aren\u2019t included in the student\u2019s federal Fafsa financial-aid calculations, while assets held by parents will be included. Distributions from a grandparent-owned 529 will be counted as untaxed income to the student when calculating financial-aid eligibility, Ms. Smith says.\n\nCan funds from a 529 be used for higher-level special-education training, such as vocational school?\n\nYes, 529 assets can be used at some vocational schools, as long as the school is eligible to participate in the Education Department\u2019s financial-aid programs, Ms. Ward says. The school\u2019s admissions or financial-aid office should be able to verify if the institution meets the requirements. More information about eligible institutions can be found at www.fafsa.ed.gov.\n\nThe trustee of my 529 account inadvertently opened the account as an UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Account), and I\u2019m told that the mistake is irrevocable. I will open a non-UTMA account for the same child. Is there any benefit to holding a 529 account as an UTMA?\n\nNot really, especially if you want the flexibility to switch the beneficiary of the account to a direct relative of the original beneficiary, such as a sibling or cousin. That\u2019s allowed under 529 rules, but not under UTMA rules. If that\u2019s the case, you would be better off directing future contributions to a non-UTMA 529 account, Ms. Smith says.\n\nMy daughters are the trustees of a trust for my grandson, who is 18 and says he doesn\u2019t want to go to college. Can they transfer the complete trust to a 529 in the hope that he changes his mind? If, after he reaches a reasonable age and still has no interest in post-high-school training or college, can they use the 529 for his siblings?\n\nThe terms of the trust dictate whether your daughters can transfer the assets to a 529 plan for your grandson or another beneficiary, Ms. Smith says. You should consult a trust attorney about what is allowed here, based on the trust documents.\n\nIf the trust is permitted to open a 529 for your grandson, it will work just like any 529. Money withdrawn must be used for qualified educational expenses, or any gains will be subject to taxes and a 10% penalty. The trust would be the 529\u2019s owner, says Ms. Smith. The trustees, however, would still be able to administer the account for the benefit of your grandson.\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nMy husband and I are considering moving to a 55-plus community when we retire. We\u2019re trying to do our homework about \u201cactive adult\u201d living. Are there questions or issues that would-be residents typically overlook?\n\nThe biggest question is whether this lifestyle fits your particular needs. Clearly, many people love these communities, and with good reason. The best developments offer a rich mix of activities and amenities in a (mostly) secure and tranquil setting. But just as clearly, many others dismiss \u201cage-restricted\u201d living in general as (pick a word) bland, out of touch, insular, old.\n\nAsk a Question Have a question about planning for and living in retirement? Email askencore@wsj.com\n\nWhichever camp you\u2019re in, here are some additional points to consider:\n\n\u2022 Demographics: This one surprises me, but it comes up again and again. The average age in some 55-plus communities is much older than 55\u2014but some new residents don\u2019t recognize this until after they have purchased their home. (Example: You\u2019re in your 60s\u2014but many of your neighbors are in their early 80s.) This disparity is more common in developments that were built a number of years ago and where the earliest residents are aging in place.\n\nWe recently heard from a reader who, with his wife, found himself in this situation. His advice: \u201cIf you want to be with young seniors, move to a new or almost-new development. Lacking that, make a real effort to get a feel for the demographics by observing clubhouse activities, talking to the concierge, etc., prior to finalizing the deal.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Finances: Sure, a fancy fitness center and a golf course are nice\u2014but is the community in good financial health? You should review the financial records of the homeowners\u2019 association and the minutes of monthly meetings. How big is the development\u2019s reserve fund? How much money is available for maintenance and future projects? Are there frequent assessments? (If you aren\u2019t comfortable with this sort of thing, ask a tax attorney to look at the figures.)\n\n\u2022 Governance and rules: These tend to overlap. To start: How is the community managed? Is there a board of directors? Who serves and for how long? Are board members full-time\u2014or part-time\u2014residents? (Do some fly in just for the winter?) Are rules enforced consistently? How are disputes handled? A good source of information on these issues: the Community Associations Network, at communityassociations.net. And speaking of rules, it\u2019s important to understand just how regimented (to be diplomatic) the homeowners\u2019 association tends to be. Want to set out a particular kind of Christmas lights? The HOA might not allow it.\n\n\u2022 Housing: Two points here. First, are homes in the community truly designed with older residents\u2014and older limbs, joints and reflexes\u2014in mind? Check out the \u201cHomeFit Guide\u201d from AARP, the Washington-based advocacy group. Second, resale. Remember: If and when the time comes to leave your home, you can\u2019t sell to the public at large; rather, you are limiting yourself to potential buyers age 55 and older.\n\n\u2022 Health care and transportation: Don\u2019t assume doctors are plentiful and accessible. Is there a family practice or health-care network that\u2019s willing to add you to its patient rolls? And how much public transportation is available? You could be living in your community for a long time. What happens if you have to give up the keys to your car?\n\n***\n\nMy wife doesn\u2019t have enough credits to qualify for Medicare on her work record. Will she have to pay a monthly premium for Medicare Part A?\n\nIt depends on whether you have sufficient credits.\n\nNormally, a person qualifies for Social Security and Medicare benefits by earning \u201ccredits.\u201d In 2017, for instance, a person receives one credit for each $1,300 in earnings, up to a maximum of four credits annually. Once you reach 40 credits, you become eligible for \u201cpremium-free\u201d Part A at age 65.\n\nThat said, Social Security and Medicare also make provisions for spouses. Example: a stay-at-home parent. In your wife\u2019s case, she can qualify for Medicare based on your work record. If you have 40 credits, your wife won\u2019t have to pay a premium for Part A.\n\n***\n\nAt the age of 64, I have been divorced 16 years, work full time, and have been told by my divorce attorney and presiding judge that I can collect Social Security based on my ex-husband\u2019s work record. Is that correct? If so, when can I do this? How large would my benefit be? And how does my benefit\u2014the one based on my work record\u2014fit into all this?\n\nYes, you can collect benefits as a divorced spouse, and the benefits could start as soon as today, if need be. But\u2026you can use a \u201cclaiming strategy\u201d that, for most people, is no longer available.\n\nPREVIOUSLY IN ASK ENCORE\n\nTo start, I assume that you and your former husband were married for at least 10 years\u2014the minimum necessary to qualify for benefits as a divorced spouse. I also assume that your \u201cfull retirement age,\u201d as defined by the Social Security Administration, is 66. (More about this in a moment.)\n\nAgain, if you wish, you could apply for benefits as a divorced spouse today. But that doesn\u2019t mean you would get benefits as a divorced spouse. If you were to apply for benefits today, at age 64, the Social Security Administration would look at: 1) the monthly benefit you would receive as a divorced spouse, and 2) the monthly benefit you would received based on your work record\u2014and would automatically award you the larger of the two. You wouldn\u2019t have a say in the matter. And you wouldn\u2019t be able to switch benefits in the future.\n\nHowever, if you wait until you reach your full retirement age to claim Social Security, you would have a choice of benefits. You could claim only your benefit as a divorced spouse (which would be equal to half of your former husband\u2019s benefit at his full retirement age) and allow your benefit (the one based on your work record) to grow. Then, at some point in the future (say, age 70), you could switch to your benefit (the one based on your work record). The jump in your payout each year from full retirement age to age 70 is 8% of the benefit at full retirement age. (That is, each year you wait to switch to the benefit based on your work record, your payout goes up by the same dollar amount.)\n\nA final note: Congress decided to eliminate this particular claiming strategy in late 2015\u2014but grandfathered in people born before Jan. 2, 1954.

Organizations like the Kahn Academy, One Day University, Coursera.org, edX.org and Udacity.com offer hundreds of classes that you can screen at home. That said, many older students seem to prefer face-to-face classes, as opposed to online offerings. \u201cIt\u2019s more engaging; you\u2019re meeting people outside your immediate social groups,\u201d Prof. Fishman says.\n\nAs for picking \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cbest\u201d courses and instructors\u2026we haven\u2019t come across any good rankings. Here again, some homework might be in order: Look online for instructors\u2019 names and reviews of their classes; talk to others who have already taken a course; try sitting in on a single class (if you\u2019re thinking about enrolling in, say, a semesterlong program).\n\nAnd finally, a request of our own: Tell us about any educational programs for the 50-plus crowd that you think are especially valuable. Your thoughts may be used in a future column.\n\n***\n\nI am retiring soon and wondered if I can roll over both my 401(k) and cash-balance pension plan into the same individual retirement account. I would be opening a new IRA for this purpose.\n\nYes, you can do this\u2014but keep three things in mind.\n\nFirst, the best way to do this is a direct rollover of your funds to the new IRA, as opposed to a \u201c60-day\u201d rollover. In the latter case, your company gives you a check, which you, in turn, must deposit in the new IRA. That approach has too many potential pitfalls. Stick with the direct rollover.\n\nPREVIOUSLY IN ASK ENCORE\n\nSecond, check to see if your retirement plan includes highly appreciated company stock, says Ed Slott, an IRA expert in Rockville Centre, N.Y. If so, you might benefit from a tax break for \u201cnet unrealized appreciation,\u201d or NUA. In short, you would place the stock in a taxable brokerage account and the rest of the funds in the IRA. This could minimize your tax bite in the future. (Needless to say, talk with a good tax professional.)\n\nThird and last: You might want to wait before you do anything. President Donald Trump is proposing tax cuts, which, in the long run, could affect the value of the NUA strategy, Mr. Slott says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m telling people with any significant tax transactions now,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s still early in the year, so there\u2019s no rush.\u201d\n\n***\n\nCan I contribute to my individual retirement account after age 70\u00bd?\n\nNope. The Internal Revenue Service, in publication 590-A (\u201cContributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements\u201d), states: \u201cContributions cannot be made to your traditional IRA for the year in which you reach age 70.5 or for any later year.\u201d\n\nThe key words in that sentence are \u201ctraditional IRA.\u201d The rules are different for Roth IRAs. You can make contributions to a Roth IRA after turning 70\u00bd, as long as you have taxable compensation. (See pages 40-41 of the same publication.).\n\n***\n\nIn a recent column, you stated that an ex-wife could claim Social Security benefits as a divorced spouse at her full retirement age and allow her own benefit (based on her work record) to grow. I\u2019m married. Does the same advice apply to me?\n\nIt depends on your birthday. If you were born before Jan. 2, 1954\u2014and if you first claim Social Security when you reach your full retirement age\u2014then, yes, the same rule would apply to you. You could claim just a spousal benefit and switch to your benefit (based on your work record) at a later point in time. Again, Congress, in 2015, eliminated this claiming strategy for most people, but made an exception for people born before the above date.\n\nMr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal, and co-author of \u201cThe Wall Street Journal Complete Retirement Guidebook.\u201d His column examines financial issues for those thinking about, planning and living their retirement.

Retirement\u2014for better and worse\u2014will change your life more than you anticipate.\n\nThat\u2019s the consensus of those who should know best: retirees themselves. Recently, as part of a discussion in these pages about changes in later life, we asked readers for help: Tell us what has surprised you in retirement. What did the experts neglect to mention? What would you tell would-be retirees to watch for?\n\nThe answer, in short: almost everything.\n\nThe surprises ran the gamut, from the wonderful to the devastating. Many readers told us they were surprised that their savings are holding up just fine, although several said that household expenses\u2014and Medicare premiums, in particular\u2014have been steeper than they anticipated.\n\nRelationships? Conventional wisdom holds that making friends in later life is difficult, but numerous retirees told us the conventional wisdom is simply wrong. They also told us, however, that they miss being part of a team at work, much more than they imagined.\n\nFitness and health? Far from turning into couch potatoes, many readers told us they are in the best shape of their lives. \u201cI feel better than I have in years,\u201d says William Wilson, a doctor who lives in Atlanta and Portland, Ore., cycles daily and has lost 40 pounds since retiring in mid-2015. \u201cI sleep well at night now, too. What a treat.\u201d\n\nAsk a Question Have a question about planning for and living in retirement? Email askencore@wsj.com\n\nMost wrenching of all: stories of retirements cut unexpectedly short. \u201cThe biggest surprise has been mortality,\u201d notes Richard Sandaas, a retired engineer and project manager, in Kirkland, Wash. \u201cMy wife took early retirement in 2003\u2014and less than 10 years later passed away. We thought we had many years of postretirement ahead of us.\u201d\n\nWhat follows is a closer look at a number of these surprises. (You can read a sampling of the emails we received in full here.) On balance, at least from those who wrote to us, there has been more joy than pain, more satisfaction than frustration. Indeed, most readers told us they are surprised at just how much they are enjoying retirement\u2014even if retirement isn\u2019t always what they expected.\n\nThe Joys of Taking a Risk\n\nWalking away from work, as with any major transition, can be overwhelming. After all, almost everything is changing: finances, daily routines, social networks. As such, some retirees are inclined to stick with the familiar, the activities and interests they know best.\n\nBut the biggest, and best, surprise in retirement, according to many readers, is what happens when you take risks. More to the point: Trying or learning something new, and risking your time and energy (and perhaps your pride) in the process, just might change your life.\n\nPatricia Plumeri, age 69 and a retired accountant, has found a \u201csecond career\u201d and \u201clifetime occupation\u201d as, improbably, a guitar player in a four-person ensemble near her home in South Pasadena, Calif. The seed, she explains, was planted during her teenage years in southern England, where she grew up, watching fledgling bands\u2014the Beatles, the Kinks, the Rolling Stones\u2014perform in local music halls. A guitar, she recalls, \u201cseemed to be an instrument that could really express feelings of joy and sadness.\u201d\n\nSix months after retiring in 2010\u2014when \u201cI could make a major time commitment [to] doing something purely for my pleasure\u201d\u2014she signed up for her first guitar lesson. Progress, she notes, was painful; hours of practice each week left her fingers numb. \u201cI would go to my gym and swim in the pool, gently massaging my left hand to get feeling back into it.\u201d\n\nToday, her group (which includes her husband, also retired, on bass) plays two hours weekly. Performing in public, at least for the moment, isn\u2019t part of the plan. But other rewards suffice.\n\n\u201cI wanted something in my life that wasn\u2019t income-driven,\u201d she notes. \u201cThe feeling of accomplishment\u2014and the realization that I can actually play a guitar\u2014is pretty heady stuff.\u201d\n\nOf course, change is difficult, and happy endings aren\u2019t guaranteed. But reader after reader made the same point: Retirement is tailor-made for a leap in the dark.\n\n\u201cI thought of hobbies and other interests that I was \u2018expected\u2019 to do, but in the end did something totally different,\u201d notes Bart Cormier, a retired engineer in Fernandina Beach, Fla. That \u201csomething\u201d is volunteering full time with children\u2019s programs, college students (as a mentor), senior home repair and his church.\n\nEven \u201cdoing good\u201d involves risks, Mr. Cormier notes. Tasks will come your way that, to your thinking, are a waste of your talents\u2014or an affront to your dignity. Mr. Cormier, on more than one occasion, found himself \u201caddressing waste-plumbing systems in homes that were a phone call away from being condemned.\u201d There\u2019s also a \u201crisk of getting too committed and not being able to say \u2018no,\u2019 \u201d he adds. \u201cThe more you do, the more is wanted.\u201d\n\nSuch hazards, though, tend to pale beside the payoffs, he notes. \u201cThere\u2019s a deep satisfaction from knowing that you have changed someone else\u2019s life for the better.\u201d\n\nAh, Free Time at Last\n\n\u201cMy surprise in retirement was discovering the unexpected luxury of time.\u201d\n\nThat observation, from Vicki Robb, a retired real-estate agent in La Jolla, Calif., was echoed in dozens of the responses we received. Even though retirement today, as opposed to 20 or 30 years ago, is seen as more \u201cactive\u201d\u2014more \u201cpurpose-filled\u201d\u2014many readers told us that \u201cactive\u201d isn\u2019t mandatory. That it\u2019s fine simply to\u2026chill.\n\n\u201cDiscovering the unexpected luxury of time\u201d | Vicki Robb, who now has time for slow cooking and art classes Photo: Vicki Robb\n\nMs. Robb, for one, says there is now \u201ctime to take an extra moment to exchange pleasantries, and time to let someone in a hurry go ahead of you. (The hurried person used to be me.) Time to play with a child at their pace, and to meander when shopping, instead of power-walking to find the item and get \u2019er done. Time for slow cooking and to drive a friend to the airport. Time to \u2018waste\u2019 a morning at your first art class, even though you\u2019ll never sell anything.\u201d\n\nA companion theme was the idea of \u201ccontrol\u201d: retirees discovering that they are in charge of their daily routines\u2014not their boss, their clients nor their children.\n\n\u201cThe biggest surprise was realizing how much of our time when working was determined/dictated by someone or something else,\u201d one couple told us. \u201cIn retirement, though, almost everything we do is because we decided to do it. It\u2019s exhilarating.\u201d\n\nJournal Report Podcast Listen to the podcast, above, or click here. Subscribe to the Journal Report podcast at wsj.com, on iTunes or Google Play Music.\n\nBrian McDonald, a retired pilot in Dillsburg, Pa., told us his days are filled with an eclectic mix of projects and chores: working in a small orchard on his property, shopping (\u201cwalking the aisles of deserted stores midmorning during the workweek is pure joy\u201d), taking in the occasional movie matinee and, for good measure, building a small airplane. The point: He manages the schedule, rather than vice versa.\n\n\u201cI challenge myself daily with work of my own choosing,\u201d he notes. \u201cI get satisfaction from a well-built fence or a blemish-free restored piece of furniture.\u201d\n\nAnd the airplane? \u201cThe kit came with 10,000 rivets in a large cardboard box, so I use the level of remaining rivets as a thermometer of progress,\u201d Mr. McDonald explains. \u201cAt last count, I have 9,000 to go.\u201d\n\nCareful Planning Pays Off\n\nFinancial surprises, not surprisingly, popped up in many of the responses we received. Frequently, a sigh of relief was audible: Nest eggs are working as planned. A number of readers noted that a healthy amount of self-discipline before retiring has a bigger impact afterward than most people realize.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived in the same house since 1972, keep cars for 10 years, exercise regularly for good health and, basically, live within my means,\u201d says Rick Abell, a retired engineer who divides his time between Colorado and Ohio. If \u201cyou want to have a comfortable retirement, sacrifices are necessary while working.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, several readers pointed to the same factor as playing a critical role in their financial success: eliminating debt before leaving the workforce. (The Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent survey of consumer finances found that, among older adult households with debt, median total debt increased to $40,900 in 2013 from $18,385 in 2001.)\n\n\u201cHow important it was to have no substantial debt\u201d | Jonathan Stolz, whose lack of debt made riding out the stock-market downturn and recession easier Photo: Jonathan Stoltz\n\n\u201cI was surprised how important it was to have no substantial debt,\u201d notes Jonathan Stolz, a retired physician in Williamsburg, Va. \u201cHaving retired in 2004 without any money owed to the bank made riding out the stock market downturn and recession four years later easier to withstand. And I was able to sleep at night.\u201d\n\nHit by High Costs\n\nAll that said, a number of readers complained about two disagreeable financial surprises: steep Medicare premiums and household expenses that were larger than anticipated.\n\nWith regard to Medicare, several readers said they simply didn\u2019t realize how sizable and/or sudden changes in their income (example: taking a buyout) can make them vulnerable to Medicare \u201csurcharges,\u201d the larger-than-normal premiums that some individuals pay for Medicare Part B and prescription-drug coverage.\n\n\u201cThe same change [in premiums] can result from the sale of stocks, bonds, etc.,\u201d notes Elizabeth Gillette, a retired communications manager in Ossipee, N.H. \u201cThis was something we had never heard about.\u201d\n\nAs for household budgets, some readers told us that one of the best-known rules of thumb in retirement planning\u2014expect to spend about 80% of your preretirement income in retirement\u2014is, well, hogwash.\n\n\u201cYou will spend 100% of your preretirement income after you retire\u201d | Steven Fechner, who spends more on travel and recreation, family events and medical Photo: Steven Fechner\n\n\u201cThe big reality is that you will spend 100% of your preretirement income after you retire,\u201d says Steven Fechner, a retired geologist in Reno, Nev. Yes, some expenses are lower, he allows, including commuting costs and clothing. But those savings, he adds, are \u201ceaten up by costs associated with having more time.\u201d Among them:\n\n\u2022 Travel and recreation. \u201cInstead of a yearly trip, now you take two or more.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Medical. \u201cInstead of putting off medical tests because you didn\u2019t have the time, you now try to figure out every ache and pain associated with aging.\u201d And you often don\u2019t have the same comprehensive insurance coverage you had through an employer.\n\n\u2022 Family duties. As in: \u201cAttending social events that you always had an excuse to avoid. Examples: weddings, funerals, baptisms, anniversary and birthday parties.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Vehicle maintenance. \u201cThe vehicles always seem to need something that you always ignored because you never had time to deal with it.\u201d\n\nThe Pain of Mortality\n\nFor all the \u201cgood\u201d surprises in retirement, several readers said would-be retirees should beware of unexpected jolts. The most devastating: the loss of a spouse.\n\nBill Sears, a retired contractor in Greenwood Village, Colo., lost his wife last year to Alzheimer\u2019s. He had spent five years as her caregiver.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wait until you retire to start enjoying life,\u201d he cautions. \u201cAppreciate that every day you\u2019re as healthy as you\u2019re ever likely to be.\u201d\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Mr. Sandaas in Washington, who lost his wife early in their retirement. The two had hoped to plant a vegetable garden in their yard and take cooking classes together to \u201cget out of the rut of a revolving menu each evening,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d And while they managed to travel extensively early in retirement, they had hoped for more.\n\n\u201cTo those who might think there may be too much postretirement travel, I say: Don\u2019t hold back,\u201d Mr. Sandaas says. It \u201cmay not be possible in later years for a variety of reasons.\u201d\n\nMr. Sears added that he is remarrying, much to his surprise. \u201cIt never occurred to me to think about marrying again,\u201d he notes. But he credits his wife-to-be with \u201csaving me from giving up.\u201d The two have known each other since the 1960s.\n\n\u201cShe and my wife had been friends all those years, so my wife is still part of our life,\u201d Mr. Sears notes. \u201cHer name comes up often and comfortably.\u201d\n\nAnd Mr. Sandaas, after his wife died, eventually bought an Airstream travel trailer and began crisscrossing the country, logging 20,000 miles in the past three years. \u201cIn addition to all the sights, the bonus is the interesting people along the way,\u201d he notes.\n\nLosing Yourself\n\nAnother warning from readers: Don\u2019t be surprised if walking away from work is more painful than you anticipate.\n\n\u201cMy biggest and most unanticipated retirement adjustment was my temporary loss of self-value,\u201d says Kevin Blakely, a former banking executive in Carefree, Ariz. \u201cHaving burned both ends of the candle for 40 years, it was a shock to the system to suddenly find myself and my calendar no longer in demand.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy temporary loss of self-value\u201d | Kevin Blakely, who found a part-time position that offered a mix of purpose and freedom Photo: Kevin Blakely\n\nTo deal with this, Mr. Blakely eventually took a part-time position with a consulting firm, a position that offered a mix of purpose and freedom. Bill Fenton, a retired doctor in Folsom, Calif., says he took a \u201cslight self-esteem hit\u201d when he walked away from medicine. His response, he says, has been to \u201credefine\u201d what constitutes \u201cwork.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy former definition of work was to earn money to pay bills. My current definition is any activity that benefits me or society and [that] has a goal. After a little trial and error, I came up with exercising every morning as my \u2018work,\u2019 with the goals being to stay healthy and to reduce my time in the local sprint triathlon to under two hours.\u201d\n\nHe has \u201cno idea where this will end up, as things are still evolving, but my need to \u2018work\u2019 is fulfilled, [and] self-esteem is back to normal.\u201d\n\nThe Ties That Bind\n\nFinally, reader after reader told us that, despite concerns to the contrary, they are finding new friends in retirement.\n\n\u201cMaybe the biggest surprise was the change in my social life,\u201d says Erika Lockhart, a former fire investigator in Albany, Calif. Her work typically had involved long hours, and, after retiring, \u201cI was feeling isolated,\u201d she recalls. Her solution: She organized two meetup groups\u2014a walking group and a cooking group, both of which have been active for two to three years.\n\nToday, \u201cI have a better social life than I can recall ever having during my working years,\u201d Ms. Lockhart says.\n\nReaders said that retirement offers countless opportunities to meet people if you\u2019re willing to be proactive: exercise classes, coffee-shop get-togethers, shared hobbies and interests (\u201cgetting my two dogs [in retirement] has been the best thing I have ever done; I have met so many wonderful people when I take the dogs for walks\u201d), volunteer groups, nonprofits. The list goes on.\n\n\u201cHow quickly and completely I left behind a 37-year career\u201d | Bill Heitz, who cycles, golfs, volunteers and travels, among other things Photo: Bill Heitz\n\nBill Heitz, former chief executive officer of a design and construction management company, remembers vividly the day he retired. He walked out of his office in Atlanta and drove directly to a new home in South Carolina, where the moving van was waiting.\n\n\u201cWhat surprised me most about retirement was how quickly and completely I left behind a 37-year career,\u201d he recalls. His days filled up immediately: golf and cycling with new neighbors, photography, woodworking, volunteering (with Score, a national organization of retirees who mentor entrepreneurs) and serving on his community\u2019s board of directors.\n\n\u201cI learned the truth in what I had heard: Happiness in retirement is directly related to the people you spend time with,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I found remarkable is that, in a community full of extremely successful retirees, very few talk about their careers. People here are focused on each other and in learning new skills and exploring new adventures.

Photo: Akos Stiller/Bloomberg News\n\nWhere is the price of gold headed? Well, consider this: One closely followed statistical model concludes that bullion is 46% overvalued, while another says that gold is 35% undervalued.\n\nWhich is closer to the truth? It\u2019s impossible to say.\n\nGold poses more difficulty than almost any other financial asset when it comes to determining fair value. The reason that there can be such a divergence of forecasts, according to Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business: \u201cGold is poorly understood. There are many forces driving the price of gold, and the importance of those forces changes through time\u2026. This is very hard to model.\u201d\n\nProf. Harvey says that when it comes to valuing a company, \u201cwe can look at the fundamentals, the sales, the margins, new investments, debt and dividends, and build a bottom-up valuation.\u201d Or when looking at a country, he says, \u201cwe can do a similar exercise looking at GDP growth, indebtedness, consumer behavior, and get a sense of the value of sovereign debt or stock markets.\u201d\n\nBut for gold, Prof. Harvey says, \u201cthere is not much to work with.\u201d\n\nAnalysts often disagree as well on valuations of particular stocks or industries, he adds. \u201cBut the range of disagreement is [relatively] small. With gold, reasonable people can have sharply different views of the value.\u201d\n\nTo see how sharply those views differ, consider three different ways to value gold: as an inflation hedge, as a hedge against political uncertainty and as a way to get portfolio diversification.\n\nJournal Report Podcast Subscribe to the Journal Report podcast at wsj.com, on iTunes or Google Play Music.\n\nFirst, gold\u2019s relationship to inflation has been anything but stable since the early 1970s, when it became legal for U.S. citizens to invest in gold. The ratio of gold\u2019s U.S. dollar price to the consumer-price index has been as low as 1.5 and as high as 8.7, according to Claude Erb, a former commodities manager at mutual-fund firm TCW Group. (See chart.)\n\nOnly over the very long term\u2014many decades, if not longer\u2014does gold do a creditable job as an inflation hedge, according to a study of gold over the past 2,000 years by Mr. Erb and Prof. Harvey. Over any period of relevance to individual investors, relating gold\u2019s price to inflation proves profoundly unhelpful.\n\nIf an investor nevertheless should insist on basing gold-trading decisions on inflation, he or she currently should be out of gold, according to Mr. Erb. That\u2019s because bullion currently is 46% higher than its inflation-based fair value of $860, according to his and Prof. Harvey\u2019s research.\n\nNext, consider geopolitical uncertainty. This also makes at least some intuitive sense. But until recently it couldn\u2019t be confirmed statistically, because no one had come up with a way to quantify uncertainty. Then three economics and finance professors\u2014 Scott Baker of Northwestern University, Nick Bloom of Stanford University and Steven Davis of the University of Chicago\u2014created a series of Economic Policy Uncertainty, or EPU, indexes. And sure enough, according to Prof. Harvey, gold shows a modest historical correlation with the global version of the EPU.\n\nThat modest correlation translates into a bullish forecast for gold currently, since the global EPU index is at an all-time high, while gold is trading 35% below its record high of $1,925 an ounce. But don\u2019t forget that gold\u2019s inflation-based valuation model is painting a very bearish picture.\n\nA different argument for investing in gold comes from financial planners. They argue that owning gold promotes portfolio diversification, on the grounds that it zigs when other assets zag, and vice versa. But Mr. Erb cautions against overconfidence on this score as well. He says that, on those occasions over the past three decades in which the financial markets suffered their worst returns, gold was more or less evenly divided between rising and falling.\n\nIf you want to invest in gold, exchange-traded funds are probably the least expensive way to do so. To invest in the physical metal itself, the largest ETF is SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), with $33.9 billion in assets under management and an expense ratio of 0.40% (or $40 per $10,000 invested). To invest in gold mining companies, the largest ETF is VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), with $11.5 billion in assets and a 0.52% expense ratio.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the least expensive way to hedge against inflation, however, you might want to look elsewhere altogether. Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, guarantee a return over inflation. A low-cost ETF that invests in TIPS is Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF (SCHP), with an expense ratio of just 0.07%.\n\nMr. Hulbert is the founder of the Hulbert Financial Digest and a senior columnist for MarketWatch.

If we will have only $15,000 in the account when the student goes to college, are we better off not opening a 529 and instead relying on financial aid, which should exceed $15,000?\n\n\u201cThere is really very little potential downside to opening a 529, especially when you expect its account value when it\u2019s time to go to college to be only around $15,000,\u201d says Paul Winter, president of Five Seasons Financial Planning in Salt Lake City. That isn\u2019t enough money to pay many tuition bills over four years, so you aren\u2019t likely to have funds left over. But if you do, you can change the beneficiary to any direct relative of the original beneficiary. You\u2019ll also reap tax benefits: Earnings within the fund grow tax-free, and if you spend the money on qualified higher-education expenses, you\u2019ll never pay federal taxes on it. You also may be able to get state-tax benefits in certain states.\n\nAs for financial aid, there\u2019s no need to choose between saving in a 529 or qualifying for aid, he says. If the parent or dependent student owns the account, the money is considered as a parental asset in financial-aid calculations\u2014meaning it is assessed at a maximum 5.64% rate in determining a student\u2019s expected family contribution instead of 20%, the rate at which some other assets are assessed. And distributions from the 529 aren\u2019t considered income.\n\n\u201cFunding a 529 account may be beneficial for financial-aid awards in comparison to some other ways to save for college, such as gifting cash to the student or establishing a UGMA/UTMA for him or her,\u201d Mr. Winter says, referring to referring to accounts held in minors\u2019 names.\n\nYou might want to compare a 529 with federal education tax credits to see which is the better deal in your situation, since the IRS prohibits taxpayers from taking a double tax benefit of tax-deferred growth of a 529 account and claiming a tax credit on those same dollars, says Jack McCloskey, a financial adviser at Vintage Financial Services in Ann Arbor, Mich. The most beneficial credit is the American Opportunity tax credit, which tops out at $2,500 a year for four years. You need to have modified adjusted gross income of $80,000 or less if single, or $160,000 or less if married and filing jointly, to claim the credit.\n\n***\n\nCan 529 funds be used for physical-education classes or sports clubs at a college?\n\nYou can use 529 distributions for any qualified higher-education expense, which includes any fee required as a condition of enrollment, Mr. Winter says. According to SavingForCollege.com, sports and club activity fees aren\u2019t considered qualified expenses.\n\n\u201cI would think that fees or tuition for physical-education classes made necessary by the college for the attainment of a degree would qualify,\u201d Mr. Winter says. For instance, if you were a kinesiology major, you might be required to take physical-education classes as a condition of your program, and that could count.\n\nMake sure you get credit for the class, however. Students aren\u2019t permitted to spend 529 money on noncredit courses without incurring the penalty, Mr. McCloskey says.\n\n***\n\nIf my student gets a scholarship, I understand I can withdraw the equivalent amount of money from my 529 without penalty, but have to pay taxes on any earnings. Is the distribution considered ordinary income or a capital gain?\n\nIf you decide to withdraw 529 money because your student has earned a scholarship, the earnings portion of your distribution is taxed as ordinary income, just like the earnings portion of IRA distributions. However, \u201cthe student\u2019s receipt of a scholarship is one of the few situations in which the additional 10% penalty on the earnings portion of nonqualified 529 plan distributions is waived,\u201d Mr. Winter says.\n\nWhat you can do to mitigate the tax bill in some 529 plans is to distribute the money to the beneficiary\u2014your student\u2014rather than the owner of the account. This means the beneficiary will pay the taxes, at what\u2019s often a lower tax rate, Mr. McCloskey says. Check with your 529 plan to see if it allows this.\n\n***\n\nOther than a private student loan, how can a foreign student studying in the U.S. with no green card fund graduate school here? His family can\u2019t afford the cost and, while he has a job, he can\u2019t save that much.\n\nThe U.S. military has programs that can help foreign students in this situation, including the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest, Mr. McCloskey says. According to the Army\u2019s website, this is a \u201crecruiting program that allows legal noncitizens with in-demand skills to join the Army in exchange for expedited U.S. citizenship.\u201d Once the student is in the military, and certainly once he is a citizen, he will be eligible for various kinds of college aid.\n\nSome foreign countries also may have rules similar to those of U.S. 529 plans, which allow plan money to be spent on overseas universities as long as they meet certain criteria, Mr. Winter says. Check if this is the case in your student\u2019s home country; if so, he may be able to use funds saved at home to study here.\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

The average diversified U.S.-stock mutual fund was down 6.4% for the first two months. But this year, stock funds have turned in a 4.6% advance for the year so far, through February\u2014and have also started out March with gains\u2014in anticipation of revived corporate earnings under the new administration.\n\nFor February itself, stock funds had a 2.7% total return, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data.\n\nVoting for stocks\n\nIt\u2019s all about the earnings, a trend that started to take shape before the presidential election, and then accelerated afterward as investors anticipated a stronger economy.

Illustration: Guido Scarabottolo for The Wall Street Journal\n\nTarget-date funds make investing for retirement easy by automatically adjusting a mix of stocks, bonds and cash to become more conservative as a \u201ctarget\u201d date\u2014usually an investor\u2019s retirement year\u2014approaches.\n\nBut what should an investor do with these funds after retirement begins?\n\nIt is a question millions of individuals will face, as target-date investments have become an increasingly popular option in 401(k) plans. Although target-date funds are designed to operate on autopilot, financial experts say people in or near retirement need to lift the hood and evaluate asset allocation and fees (both available in the prospectus) to determine if they should simply stay the course after the target date arrives or reinvest the assets in some other way.\n\nTarget-date \u201cfunds should not be selected [solely] because of investor laziness, as the closer the investor gets to retirement the greater impact their laziness can have on the outcome of their retirement funds,\u201d says Keith Clark, adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management and partner at DWC Erisa Consultants, a St. Paul, Minn., firm that advises employers.\n\nOne problem, Mr. Clark says, is that target-date funds don\u2019t take into consideration factors other than an investor\u2019s age and thus can be an \u201coverly simplistic\u201d strategy. One investor may reach a realistic retirement goal \u201ca year or two before the target date, while another is far short,\u201d meaning the individual may have to keep working or cut back spending in retirement. The fund is most likely no longer appropriate\u201d for either investor, with the postretirement allocation too risky in the first case, and too conservative in the second, he says.\n\nTarget-date funds don\u2019t factor in \u201cwhether the investor has a pension, is delaying Social Security, is supporting adult children, is planning on buying or selling a house or any other personal goal,\u201d says Benjamin Sullivan, a planner with Palisades Hudson Financial Group in Austin, Texas.\n\nSo while the ability to leave investment selection and asset allocation to the pros is what attracts many individuals to target-date funds, experts say it is still important for investors to look at whether the asset mix during retirement is going to suit their life expectancy, or any changes in marital status, finances, health and willingness to take risk.\n\nPopular by default\n\nTarget-date funds have taken off in recent years as the federally approved \u201cdefault\u201d option in 401(k)s for investors who don\u2019t choose other investments.\n\nJournal Report Podcast Subscribe to the Journal Report podcast at wsj.com, on iTunes or Google Play Music.\n\nThe products, which have been around since the early 1990s, typically hold an assortment of stock and bond funds, sometimes more than 20, with a high allocation to stocks for younger investors that gradually gives way to more bonds and cash as the target date approaches. Also known as life-cycle funds, age-based funds or by their abbreviation as TDFs, target-date funds rebalance at least annually to keep the mix of stocks, bonds and cash promised for that point in the cycle.\n\nThere are essentially two types of target-date funds. First, there are \u201cto\u201d funds, which reach their final allocation at the target date, and can work well for investors planning to cash out at that point, says Robin Solomon, who advises firms on 401(k) plan design as a partner in the Washington, D.C., law firm of Ivins, Phillips & Barker. Then there are \u201cthrough\u201d funds, which become ever more conservative after the target date, best serving investors who gradually draw funds for living expenses, she says.\n\n\u2018Watch out for \u2018fund of funds\u2019 [with] two layers of fees as the investment company may be using their own funds as the underlying investment.\u2019 \u2014Prof. Keith Clark\n\nIt\u2019s important to know that the \u201cglide path\u201d to a safer mix can vary considerably among target-date funds, with some continuing to hold more than half of assets in stocks years after the target date passes, while others have just 20% at the same point, a Morningstar study found. The allocation to equities, which is meant to provide growth to keep up with inflation during a retirement that could last decades, can include risky foreign and small-cap stocks, not just blue chips. During the financial crisis, many investors were shocked by losses in funds with a 2010 target date, though those funds didn\u2019t fall as far as the stock market due to their bondholdings.\n\n\u201cThis was a big problem during the last bear market, when many \u2018conservative\u2019 funds geared for people nearing retirement loaded up on equities and high-yield bonds, only to be slaughtered during the downturn,\u201d says David Twibell, president of Custom Portfolio Group in Englewood, Colo. \u201cAnd while many funds have restricted their asset-allocation guidelines as a result, we really won\u2019t know if this will be enough to protect potential retirees until the next bear market hits.\u201d\n\nThe shift toward bonds carries risks, too, as bond funds could lose value if interest rates rise in coming years, as many predict. Cash is safe but earns virtually nothing. So even a sensible-sounding conservative allocation poses risks\u2014the chance of falling short if the investor lives a long time or if personal expenses or inflation pick up.\n\nJennifer E. Myers, president of SageVest Wealth Management in McLean, Va., says studies have shown that the standard practice of withdrawing 4% a year from retirement accounts succeeds for a long retirement only if the account is at least 75% stocks when withdrawals start, making many target-date funds too conservative.\n\nFees on target-date funds can start to chew up investment returns as the holder approaches and enters retirement. Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nAnother danger with relying on target-date funds for living expenses: Withdrawals mean liquidating all types of holdings in line with their allocation in the fund, defeating part of the purpose of having eggs in multiple baskets.\n\n\u201cMost investment advisers prefer to sell bonds to cover withdrawal needs during market downturns, opting to let stocks recover rather than locking in losses,\u201d she says. \u201cThis choice is not available when you sell shares of a [target-date] fund.\u201d\n\nFor individuals who own target-date funds through 401(k)s and other employer plans, retirement presents several options.\n\nInvestors generally can remain in the target-date fund in the former employer\u2019s 401(k), or move the money into other investments within the plan. Alternatively, they could roll the assets into an individual retirement account, which would allow them to invest in virtually anything.\n\nIf they are 59\u00bd or older, they can cash out of the fund without penalty to reduce debts, buy an investment property or reinvest in another product that may be a better fit with their goals and risk tolerance.\n\n\u201cIt can be a good idea to look at alternatives such as immediate or deferred annuities or individual fixed-income holdings that align income to the individual\u2019s needs,\u201d says Colin B. Exelby, president of Celestial Wealth Management of Towson, Md. \u201cThey can often be used to reduce the [late-life] risk of running out of retirement income and can be laddered, as well, to reduce interest-rate risk. Of course, the trade-off is that they often reduce the potential upside and often don\u2019t provide inflation protection. For a portion of client assets they can serve a very important purpose.\u201d\n\nChewed up by fees?\n\nIn addition to a fund\u2019s investment mix and risk, another variable target-date investors need to consider is the price of the fund.\n\n\u201cWatch out for \u2018fund of funds\u2019 [with] two layers of fees as the investment company may be using their own funds as the underlying investment,\u201d Mr. Clark says.\n\nTarget-date funds typically charge an overall expense ratio on top of the expenses of the funds they contain. As the portfolio becomes more conservative near and after retirement, fees may chew up a larger share of returns.\n\n\u201cSome funds have expense ratios topping 1.5%, and it isn\u2019t unusual for funds to have expenses in the 0.70% to 0.80% range,\u201d says Mr. Twibell. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot to pay for a target-date fund, which at its core is simply a diversified mix of other publicly available mutual funds.\u201d\n\nAn investor might replicate the mix in the target-date fund by choosing index funds or exchange-traded funds charging 0.2% or less.\n\n\u201cPair a diversified, low-cost equity ETF with a similar bond ETF and you are well on your way,\u201d he says. \u201cSprinkle in a handful of other low-cost funds representing other asset classes like international stocks, real estate and commodities, and you\u2019ve got your own DIY target-date fund at a fraction of the cost.\u201d\n\nMr. Brown is a writer in Livingston, Mont.

Email askencore@wsj.com\n\nThey travel (which includes, in most cases, the long-awaited \u201cdream trip.\u201d) They spend time with their grandchildren. They clean out the closets and the attic. They have a few lunches with former colleagues. And then the day comes when they look in the mirror and ask: What now?\n\nSo\u2026the problem, if there is one, isn\u2019t so much the initial plunge into retirement. Most people enjoy their newfound freedom. It is what happens (or, rather, what fails to happen) after the first year that typically leads to problems\u2014and boredom.\n\nA fulfilling retirement, for the most part, has three ingredients: good health; a purpose, something that gives meaning to your days; and a good financial plan. Yes, \u201cfind your purpose\u201d or \u201cfind your passion\u201d might sound trite. But it\u2019s true. It works. In recent years, Encore, the retirement report of The Wall Street Journal, has profiled retirees who have found purpose in dozens of areas, including:\n\nPhotography, teaching, full-time travel, cooking, antique bookbinding, leading cycling tours, oyster farming, \u201csugaring\u201d (making maple syrup), playing a musical instrument, nursing, opening a whiskey distillery, driving an ambulance, directing a children\u2019s performing-arts studio, starting a gardening business, opening a pizzeria, horseshoeing, fitness instruction, running a bed-and-breakfast, opening a yoga studio, wildlife conservation, and, of course, volunteer work and nonprofits.\n\nIn other words, there is no one way to avoid being bored. There are almost as many purposes as there are people.\n\nIf you\u2019re adrift and unsure how to turn around your retirement, the following resources can help: encore.org, which is unaffiliated with The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Encore; lifereimagined.aarp.org; nationalservice.gov/programs/senior-corps; \u201cThe Big Shift: Navigating the New Stage Beyond Midlife,\u201d by Marc Freedman ; \u201cThe Encore Career Handbook,\u201d by Marci Alboher ; \u201c65 Things To Do When You Retire,\u201d edited by Mark Evan Chimsky; \u201cBoundless Potential,\u201d by Mark S.

I turn 65 soon but plan to continue working and staying on the health-insurance plan provided by my employer; as such, I won't sign up for Medicare Parts A, B or D for probably three years. Can I avoid the penalty premium? And, if so, how do I do it?\n\nBe careful: Your particular health plan might require that you sign up for Medicare when you reach 65. So check with your employer as soon as possible. If you aren\u2019t required to sign up for Medicare at 65, you can enroll\u2014without paying a penalty\u2014during what\u2019s called a \u201cspecial enrollment period.\u201d\n\nFor instance, you have an eight-month special enrollment period to sign up for Medicare Parts A and/or B that starts the month after your employment ends or the group health insurance based on your current employment ends, whichever happens first. (Note: Under Medicare rules, COBRA and retiree health plans aren \u2019t considered \u201ccoverage based on current employment.\u201d Again, be careful.)\n\nMedicare explains much of this on its website. Go to medicare.gov and, in the search box, type: I have employer coverage.\n\nDuring my working years, I was covered by either a defined-benefit pension plan or a 401(k). In most years, I also contributed the annual maximum to traditional individual retirement accounts for my wife and me with after-tax dollars, since I was unable to deduct these contributions. When we begin taking required distributions from these accounts, can we exclude the total amount contributed with after-tax dollars and only pay tax on the gain?\n\nTechnically, you don\u2019t have to pay tax on withdrawals of after-tax contributions. But\u2026the rules involving withdrawals from IRAs make the answer to this question more complicated.\n\nHere\u2019s the key: All the funds in your IRA are considered one pot, even if you have several separate IRA accounts. (The pot also includes balances in SEP and SIMPLE IRAs, if you have them.) After-tax funds, once they are inside your IRA, are mixed with pretax funds\u2014and can\u2019t be \u201cunmixed.\u201d So, when the time comes to withdraw funds, you can\u2019t withdraw only after-tax funds, says Ed Slott, an IRA specialist in Rockville Centre, N.Y.\n\nPREVIOUSLY IN ASK ENCORE\n\nMr. Slott calls this \u201cthe cream-in-the coffee\u201d rule. Once you put cream in your coffee, you can\u2019t take out just cream. Each drop that comes out contains some cream and some coffee. How much of each? When funds are withdrawn from an IRA, they must follow the \u201cpro rata rule.\u201d Each dollar withdrawn will contain a percentage of after-tax funds. The percentage is based on the amount of after-tax funds in the total balance of all your IRAs.\n\nMr. Slott offers this example: Let\u2019s say you have a total IRA balance of $300,000, which includes $30,000 of after-tax funds (the cream). You can\u2019t withdraw only the $30,000 of after-tax funds and pay no tax. If you withdraw $30,000, then 10% will be tax-free and 90% will be taxable. That\u2019s because the after-tax funds are 10% of the total IRA balance. So only $3,000 of the $30,000 withdrawal will be tax-free.\n\nMr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal, and co-author of \u201cThe Wall Street Journal Complete Retirement Guidebook.\u201d His column examines financial issues for those thinking about, planning and living their retirement.

And he asked readers to write in about their own unexpected challenges and opportunities in this new phase of their lives.\n\nBelow is a collection of the hundreds of thoughtful and inspiring emails we received from readers:\n\nI retired from the retail furniture business at the age of 51 when we sold our business. My wife and I elected to live on less income for the bonus of more time together.\n\nOne of the biggest surprises has been in the kitchen. I found cooking very rewarding. I have exchanged my sous chef hat for the larger toque! That interest has translated into how we now travel. We both enjoy market shopping in France and Italy and are able to stay for longer periods since I no longer \u201cpunch the clock\u201d every day. The daily experiences at the boulangerie and with the fellow selling vegetables let me establish relationships with people of other cultures. We eat well at a fraction of the cost of restaurant food.\n\nBoth of us view my 50- to 60-hour retail weeks as \u201cpaying the price early\u201d in my work career that now allows us the wonderful freedom of travel. We also enjoy the flexibility of our own schedule at a time of life when we have energy and enthusiasm to accept volunteer opportunities and church responsibilities.\n\nWe feel retiring early was a great gift. Our advice to others is: Don\u2019t wait until it is too late!\n\n\u2014Ken and Jan Augustine, Ames, Iowa\n\nI delayed retirement until past age 73 in part because, as a woman who lives alone and has no nearby relatives, I feared becoming isolated and ignored.\n\nAs it turns out two-plus years later, I love being alone, owning the day, and having no required daily contact with other people. For a gregarious woman who made her living in sales and loved to cook and entertain, a total surprise.\n\n\u2014Virginia Butterworth, Tiverton, R.I.\n\nThe biggest surprise in retirement for me was the challenge of figuring out \u201cthe second act.\u201d\n\nI had a wonderful 37-year corporate career, and retired three years ago after my wife and I raised three daughters. We carefully followed the guidance about financial planning as we prepared for retirement, and have had no surprises on that front.\n\nBut finding a rewarding post-retirement occupation has been problematic. I tried volunteering, tutoring math, teaching high school, starting a business, mentoring young professionals\u2014all worthwhile pursuits, but none were captivating. I then tried coding\u2014and am passionately engaged 40 hours a week in software projects.\n\nI was surprised at how long it took me to find an engaging pursuit, and was very surprised by the pursuit that I landed on as a \u201chobby.\u201d\n\n\u2014Patrick Howard, Charlotte, N.C.\n\nWhat I love about being retired:\n\n\u2014The ability to volunteer and give back. I never had time as a working mom. (Yes, I did girl scouts, PTA, soccer board member, etc. Every volunteer activity was children-centered.) Now, volunteering with hospice and ushering at the theaters, etc., I\u2019ve discovered a whole new side of myself.\n\n\u2014I disciplined myself to live on 60% of my income the last few years of work to make sure I could live on less money. (Bonus: an extra nest egg when I retired.)\n\n\u2014I now have time to truly enjoy life. As a working mom of three, life prior is a blur. The control you get of your life when you retire is the best bonus that I didn\u2019t expect!\n\n\u2014Had I known how good retirement would be (the carrot at the end of working) I think I would have enjoyed working even more, knowing what a wonderful reward I would receive when I retired! Retirement is truly the best perk you receive from working.\n\n\u2014Trudy Salim, Lorain, Ohio\n\nWhen Uncle Sam gave me the opportunity to retire early at 55 with no penalty I went to Ray, my financial adviser, to crunch some numbers. The numbers were fine. That wasn\u2019t the issue. But he gave me some advice that I didn\u2019t much believe at the time.\n\n\u201cPaul,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing is ever what you think it\u2019s gonna be going into it. Not a new job. Not marriage. Not divorce. You have to feel your way through these things. Retirement is the same.\u201d\n\nI thought I would take a little break and then go back to work. While I practice law a little bit out of my house, I really haven\u2019t worked in the five years I have been retired. I have become a musician again, I teach school now and again and I spend time with a wonderful lady I met a couple of years ago. I had this idea that I would play golf all the time. But then I realized that I played golf to reduce stress from work. Now I find golf stressful.\n\nI guess the biggest surprise is that I didn\u2019t really believe Ray at the time. But he was right on the money. Retirement ain\u2019t nothing I thought it would be. But it\u2019s pretty great.\n\n\u2014Arthur Paul Bowen, Little Rock, Ark.\n\nHere\u2019s what happens. You sleep a tiny bit later, and then spend a bit longer at the gym. You actually taste your breakfast. You find yourself still reading\u2014actually reading\u2014the paper at 8:30 a.m., and haven\u2019t even showered or dressed yet.\n\nYou shop more frequently for fresher ingredients and cook better meals. You help out more with the grandkids. You volunteer for one extra thing. The garden never looked better.\n\nAnd so it goes\u2026happily.\n\n\u2014Carol Watts, Overland Park, Kan.\n\nUpon retiring, I looked forward to rest, relaxation, and enjoying the fruits of lifelong labors. Friends and family told me that was well deserved.\n\nI filled my retired life with time with our grandchildren, endeavors with our church, exercise for my body, academic studies for my growth, reading for my mind, and beach walks for my spirit.\n\nBut something was absent from this idyllic picture. Somehow I realized that I really missed being paid for work!\n\nSo I set up a consultancy, working with former clients on their current challenges. They know they can depend on me for success. I know I can depend on them for an ongoing business relationship. The work is part-time, leaving plenty of room for the personal pursuits that are very fulfilling. And payment for effort provides psychological and financial rewards that are like a cherry on a sundae.\n\nSociety prepared me to expect retirement. But life prepared me for what I call \u201crewirement.\u201d I highly recommend it for all who are entering this new chapter in their lives.\n\n\u2014John Bowman, Fairfield, Conn.\n\nFirst, I am busy all the time. I have something scheduled every almost every day. And when nothing is scheduled I find a project I didn\u2019t plan and do that.\n\nI thought that I would have time to make my garden a showpiece. Not true.\n\nI have taught skiing for 17 years. I thought that I would have the opportunity to ski more and explore other areas when not skiing at my mountain. Not true.\n\nI enjoy doing puzzles. I thought I would be completing one a month. Not true.\n\nI thought I could sit down and read The Wall Street Journal every morning. Not true. (Read it online while on the run.)\n\nWhat is true is that if I am in the middle of a good book I can read longer.\n\nWhat is true is that when I come back from the gym, I don\u2019t have to rush to change.\n\nWhat is true, I am free for spur-of-the-moment trips and visits. Sunny, warm day, go to the beach. Art exhibit at a museum, by all means, go see it. Call a friend for lunch. Shop when you want, not with the herds on the weekend.\n\nI am only in year three of retirement and much of the past year was taken up with the construction of an addition, so I may still be able to manage time as the ideal retirement is portrayed on television and in brochures.\n\nExtra time? Not true. What is true is the ability to manage your time.\n\n\u2014Althea Prescott Cranton, Wenham, Mass.\n\nFirst, I was surprised how important it was to have no substantial debt when entering the golden years. Having retired in 2004 without any money owed to the bank made riding out the stock market downturn and recession four years later easier to withstand, and I was able to sleep at night.\n\nSecond, if you have been the prime breadwinner in a successful marriage while your partner kept the home fires burning and raised the children, do not underestimate the importance of the changing marital dynamics in retirement. In our instance, cooking became my responsibility while my wife for the first time took a part-time sales job in a women\u2019s clothing store. It continues to be a surprisingly successful role reversal plus her clothing discount helps the budget!\n\nThird, do not jump on early offerings of retirement activities. I was surprised by the number of different options retirees have to fill out their day. Be selective and wait for the right fit\u2014it may take some time. Initially in retirement, I attended classes given for seniors at our local university. Then after several years, I switched from student to \u201cprofessor.\u201d I have now been teaching a different course on the history of medicine every fall term for the last seven years. What fun, and worth the wait.\n\nFinally, but not surprisingly, heed that old expression, \u201cbe calm and carry on.\u201d It may be the best overall advice in retirement.\n\n\u2014Jonathan L. Stolz, Williamsburg, Va.\n\nMy husband and I retired eight years ago. Shortly into retirement I realized I wasn\u2019t ready and returned to work part time for a few years before retiring for good.\n\nShortly into our retirement my aunt (now age 92) shared her perspective: In retirement, she told us, there are first the go-go years, then the slow-go years, and finally the no-go years. We have followed her advice taking numerous trips both in and out of the country, some for months at a time, others for a long weekend. We were surprised to reach our slow-go years so quickly due to my husband\u2019s physical ills, but we continue to enjoy our travels at a slower pace.\n\nFinancially, the surprises included the continued growth of our investment portfolio thanks to a solid, conservative investment plan, and careful living. We were also surprised by the number of items we forgot to budget for, like increased use of cellphones and Internet data.\n\nOverall, we are thrilled with retirement, able to do things we couldn\u2019t while we were working full time. We live in an over-55 community with multiple resources, lots of folks to \u201cplay\u201d with and to help out when needed. We have befriended folks from around the country, a dramatic change from our bi-coastal living. We\u2019re surprised by our change in attitude, about how many small things we let slide, they just aren\u2019t very important, and probably never were.\n\n\u2014Adrienne Kirschner, Surprise, Ariz.\n\nMy husband and I had the option to take early retirement four years ago. He was a teacher so we could never travel off-season. I was a sales representative and drove 30,000 miles a year in two states.\n\nThe lack of crowds, heat, and more time for enjoyment has made traveling much easier. We plan extra days leaving and arriving to take the stress off and more time at destinations. If the flight is delayed or the weather bad at a National Park, no worries. It\u2019s surprising how this small change totally removed the stress of traveling! Airfare that is a day-plus is often amazingly cheaper\u2014but horrific if spent hanging out overnight at an airport. We book a hotel, make a more convenient connection, relax, and still save money now that we have time.\n\nI am surprised at how disciplined we have to be in retirement to do the things we now enjoy. I started piano almost four years ago. I still need to practice and go to lessons. My husband and I both attend yoga three times a week. We still have to get up and get going to attend class and practice daily. He still has to make time to read the book for his book club because the group chooses bigger books. We still need to arrange time to see friends because their time fills up; we can\u2019t be spontaneous just because we don\u2019t work.\n\nMy husband realized this year that he needed more casual social contacts. At work you can talk about the Cubbies winning or how Gonzaga will do this winter. He needed to invest energy to develop casual social contacts in our neighborhood\u2014not just work on projects around the house, which he enjoys. We\u2019ve had and attended social hours where people came over with appetizers and we sat outside before dinner. Another neighbor had a band concert and invited the neighborhood. We\u2019ve talked about an open house block party when the weather gets cold and we retreat inside.\n\nNew friends shared that they started working for concerts and sporting events because the job is flexible and a way to work only as needed so they can still travel. We plan to sign up soon.\n\nIn summary:\n\n\u2014Plan for more time when traveling for bad weather, travel delays, and cheaper plus-one-day airline tickets\n\n\u2014Be disciplined with time to purse interests, exercise, and friendships or time slips away.\n\n\u2014Develop causal social contacts that you lose through work.\n\n\u2014Sherri Robinson and Steve Ross, Spokane Valley, Wash.\n\nI was surprised to find that two things are more important than money in retirement:\n\n\u2014Time: Finding a rewarding use for your now-plentiful time is a big retirement concern. Otherwise, boredom will quickly ensue. Find a cheap, all-consuming hobby that will bring new people into your life. Mine was beekeeping. Or, if hobbies aren\u2019t your thing, seek out fulfilling charity work.\n\n\u2014Health: Getting and/or staying healthy should be your No. 1 job in retirement. Without good health, little else matters. Commit to a daily exercise program. Find an affordable gym and go every day. Mine was the local YMCA, which Medicare Advantage pays for. Do mainly cardio, but some weights, too.\n\n\u2014Dick Barnes, Long Beach, Calif.\n\nI think the biggest surprise about my retirement five years ago wasn\u2019t what I found in retirement but the transition to it. In preparation for retiring, I, like most others, did a great deal of research\u2014reading, meeting with our financial advisers, and speaking with both recent and long-term retirees. A common theme that emerged from all my sources was that retirement is a \u201cmajor life transition\u201d and needed to be regarded accordingly.\n\nI reflected on other major life transitions I\u2019ve experienced: happy ones like success on the job, marriage, buying houses, having a family; and not-so-happy ones like job difficulties and losing loved ones. In all cases, whether happy or not, every major life transition involved work, emotion, and sometimes trauma. With these thoughts in mind, I approached my scheduled retirement with some level of concern. I had announced my retirement well in advance so I had plenty of time for personal reflection and obsession.\n\nWell, R-day eventually arrived. I stayed until 5 p.m. on my last day and took the train home, saying goodbye to the conductor. My wife and I enjoyed a previously planned quiet dinner at home, and I went to bed at my normal time, wondering how I\u2019d feel waking up the next day as a retiree.\n\nWhen I awoke, I didn\u2019t sense any overwhelming feelings. Nor did I in the next days, weeks and months. I concluded that retirement\u2014and this was my biggest surprise\u2014was the easiest \u201cmajor life transition\u201d I\u2019ve ever experienced!\n\nWhile I liked work, I love retirement. I keep busy with walking, reading, puttering, hiking, tennis, bridge, travel, and volunteering\u2026all fun things to do and yet I still have time to linger over coffee and the Internet each morning, which is among the best of all.\n\n\u2014Robert Bucco, Malvern, Pa.\n\nMy biggest surprise about retirement was learning my husband\u2019s idea of retirement.\n\nI retired, bought two $1,500 recumbent trikes, and ride. At 55, he left a thriving medical practice. This was after being driven to distraction by insurance companies and nonsensical government regulations. Much to my extreme surprise, he started exercising, passed a military physical, joined the Army National Guard and also volunteers at a free medical clinic that provides medical care based on the Dr. Marcus Welby model. His medical guard unit went to Poland for summer drill last May.\n\nWe have been married 38 years and are both in better shape today. Life is good!\n\n\u2014Deborah Scott, Chattanooga, Tenn.\n\nI prepared for retirement from a Fortune 100 company for the last 10 years of employment. Paid off the house, and my wife\u2019s career had taken off. I started a small business, and my finances are in good shape.\n\nBut for the first two years I dreamed every night that I was still at work. I couldn\u2019t get over the idea that I had retired too young, even though I put in 30 good years at my career. I couldn\u2019t shake it. I even took a job with a contract company, doing the same type of work I retired from. And that only made me feel like I really screwed up. Then something happened, and the idea that I missed an important cue was gone.\n\nIt has to do with my small business in a completely unrelated field, which began to show a slow but steady success. It turned out that it was the \u201cproblem solving\u201d that I missed. And even as I write this, I feel lucky to have the chance to try to build something new and personally fulfilling.\n\nThanks for giving me the chance to put this into words.\n\n\u2014James Spica, Lagrangeville, N.Y.\n\nI\u2019ve been retired for about 13 years, after an unexpected restructuring at our magazine. I was only 50 at the time, and thought I had a several years left to continue my corporate pursuits.\n\nOne of the most shocking things I discovered when I no longer had to go into the office was the wide swatch of time that stretched before me. I used to define myself by my title, West Coast Regional Manager, armed with flashy business cards, a company car and a generous expense account.\n\nWithout these, I didn\u2019t know who I was. Now, left to my own devices, I felt naked. At first it was a relief because I no longer had to fight the swarm of traffic on the freeways or deal with corporate stress. But who was I if I wasn\u2019t some hotshot publishing maven?\n\nIt was a real time for soul-searching. I tried pet photography, dog walking, and flirted with a variety of other odd jobs, until I finally excepted the fact that I didn\u2019t want to go back into corporate life. My financial adviser told me it was OK to retire, so I trusted her judgment, and took the plunge. I\u2019ve never looked back.\n\nNow I\u2019m having a blast just simply being me. I have found that the personality from my youth has flourished again. I am doing a fair amount of writing, photography, singing, and improv. I developed a line of scarves based on my photography that is selling very well. My days fly by with other retirees who are thankful to have the time to simply enjoy their hobbies.\n\nI advise my friends that before they retire, think about what truly makes them happy. Perhaps it\u2019s gardening. Maybe it\u2019s travel. Volunteering can be very rewarding or even a part-time job. If you pursue what really fulfills you, it will make the transition into retirement much easier.\n\nAfter all, don\u2019t we all work hard to simply have the freedom to enjoy our passions? I know that I do.\n\n\u2014Mary McGrath, Culver City, Calif.\n\nAfter 50 years in business, I retired; my wife, an operating-room nurse, joined me shortly thereafter. In our mid-70s, we began to see family and friends experiencing illness, accidents or unexpected events and being forced to make major life changes\u2026the burdens falling on a spouse or children. I realized that the worst legacy I could leave to my wife and children would be to leave them with a large home filled with \u201cstuff\u201d and no plan for the future.\n\nMy wife and I laid out a plan, gave to our children whatever \u201cstuff\u201d they wanted, disposed of everything else in an orderly way, researched senior residences, selected a new apartment home and sold our condo.\n\nWe have been living in a senior residence for two years and truly enjoy our new life. Now, in our 80s, we both drive, enjoy the activities in our residence but go out frequently. I teach \u201csenior\u201d classes at senior venues including a class that encourages seniors to take charge of their lives and not wait for an event to trigger a loss of self-determination. The class is called the \u201cStory of S.I.D.\u201d (Seniors in Denial).\n\nI never dreamed that after a half century in businesses that I loved that I would transition into a form of \u201cacademia\u201d\u2026but I love it, and my wife could not be happier being engaged in arts and crafts and helping others.\n\nRetirement is great as long as you take charge of it, stay active, engaged in learning and socializing\u2026with some good luck along with prayers for good health. The hard thing to learn is that all your \u201cstuff\u201d is just \u201cstuff.\u201d Life is all about family and friends.\n\n\u2014Brandt Ross, Atlanta\n\nI\u2019m a retired pediatrician who had the opportunity to take early leave from a busy frantic practice. My biggest surprise was the sudden change in opportunities for social interaction. Going from a busy stimulating, but frantic, pace to a life of exceptional \u201cquiet\u201d was a jolt. I recognized quickly that I needed to be around people in some way.\n\nTo address that, I took a year to decompress and contemplate my future. I was lucky to have a good public university in our city, so I dived into a two-year executive M.B.A. program and never looked back. Best thing I ever did. Back around people and stimulated to no end.\n\nAfter graduating, I taught in their Health Care Management program for the next 10 years. Upon recently retiring from this position, I have carefully selected several nonprofits in my community and state and continue to meet wonderful curious people. I feel lucky!\n\n\u2014Dick McCoy, Rock Hill, S.C.\n\nI retired in September at age 62 from a communications job in San Francisco and so far, it\u2019s been fabulous.\n\nI was surprised at how quickly I took to it from day one. People told me there would be an adjustment period and I would miss work, but it has been a seamless transition for me. I was a little concerned about how I would fill my days, but it\u2019s never been an issue. I sleep better and longer, exercise more, read more, spend more time with my wife (she agrees that\u2019s a good thing) and actually think more now that I have fewer distractions.\n\nI do have some general advice for would-be-retirees:\n\n1. Add 10% to any budget you develop. Even after just a few months of retirement, I already see expenses I underestimated. I didn\u2019t anticipate, for example, going out to lunch so often. It adds up.\n\n2. Allow yourself to settle into your new life, don\u2019t rush it. I\u2019ve approached retirement initially like an extended weekend. We\u2019ve taken local trips to Lake Tahoe and Big Sur but the biggies like volunteering, extended travel and pursuing new interests and personal goals can wait for the time being. I\u2019ve learned being bored occasionally after 40 years in the workplace can be a luxury.\n\n3. Give your spouse his or her space. Don\u2019t forget it\u2019s an adjustment for them as well. I usually don\u2019t see my wife until lunch every day because I work out as soon as I get up and then read my newspapers, magazines for a few hours in a public place.\n\n4. Maintain relationships. I joined Facebook for the first time, and it\u2019s a nice way to stay in touch with former co-workers and friends.\n\n5. Don\u2019t look back once you\u2019ve made the decision to retire. Take full advantage of the time retirement provides and the many new opportunities awaiting you. It will be important to approach this next phase of your life with wonder, enthusiasm and openness.\n\nFinally, if you have the financial resources and are debating whether to retire, I encourage you to go for it in spite of what others may say.\n\n\u2014Terry Hurley, San Francisco\n\nMy biggest and most unanticipated retirement adjustment was my temporary loss of self-value.\n\nHaving burned both ends of the candle as a banking executive for 40 years, it was a shock to the system to suddenly find myself and my calendar no longer in demand. I shifted from days where my calendar was full of back-to-back meetings (which I hated), a voice mail that was constantly full, and hundreds of emails per day, to\u2026nothing.\n\nIt was very disorienting. \u201cCan they really get along that well without me?\u201d \u201cDoesn\u2019t anyone miss that trove of experience and value I brought to the table?\u201d It made me realize something I\u2019d never thought about before: how much one values their self based on whom they were or what they did at work.\n\nI\u2019d been advised in the year leading up to retirement not to commit to anything for at least 90 days \u201cbefore letting anyone punch your dance card.\u201d It was advice I chose to follow, uncomfortable as it was.\n\nIn the three months following retirement I was contacted by numerous consulting firms. Eventually, I agreed to work, part-time, for one of them. I was a senior adviser, a counselor of sorts for both the firm\u2019s consultants as well as their clients. It was great. People sought me out because of the well of experience I\u2019d accumulated after four decades. But it also afforded me plenty of freedom to do things I hadn\u2019t had time for in the past.\n\nAfter a few years, I found another part of me pulling myself away from my part-time advisory role. I wanted to have even more time to travel, visit the kids and enjoy the company of my wife.\n\nEventually, I joined a couple of boards, which kept me intellectually in the game, but afforded me plenty of time to go play.\n\nLife is good!\n\n\u2014Kevin Blakely, Carefree, Ariz.\n\nWe retired 11 years ago, in our late 50s. We\u2019d been in southern California for 25 years, close to my husband\u2019s family, both of us with fairly successful careers. But we made the leap, sold out and moved to rural Oregon. Best choice ever.\n\nOne thing that was no surprise was how welcoming our neighbors were. We had lived in extremely rural Kansas at the beginning of our marriage, and knew from that experience that making and keeping good neighbors is vital to the well being of a rural community. Our neighbors here are an amazingly diverse and wonderful lot.\n\nBut we were surprised about what we learned when we put in an acre of pinot noir, next to the 200 or so cabernet vines that came with the place. We knew nothing about growing grapes or making wine, but were next to the Oregon State University experimental vineyard and within easy driving distance of both OSU and the University of Oregon. Classes, hands on, much help from the OSU group, talking with other small grape growers like our neighbor down the hill and the one across the way, and a lot of hard work all helped.\n\nWe now sell our grapes to two commercial wineries and a host of small wine makers. And make enough for ourselves, too.\n\n\u2014Marilyn Palmer, Alpine, Ore.\n\nMy biggest surprise in retirement? A modest one: My favorite day of the week became Monday, instead of Saturday. I look forward to Mondays with relish. All weekday services are open. Favorite recreation locations and activities are not clogged with weekend crowds. And I don\u2019t have to get up early and go to work. Life is good.\n\n\u2014Ric Rine, McCall, Idaho\n\nAfter more than 40 years in the high-tech industry, 30 of which were spent as a Silicon Valley software entrepreneur and public company CEO, I sold my company to a private equity firm and retired. That was three years ago.\n\nIn the time since, perhaps my greatest surprise has been how much pleasure I am able to obtain from exploring new areas of knowledge just for the sake of fulfilling my curiosity.\n\nFor instance, during my college years I read just enough course texts on physics so I could pass the tests and get good grades, but rarely ever read anything scientific for pleasure. I was keenly aware of how hopelessly clueless I was upon graduation about vast areas of modern physics such as relativity, quantum mechanics, and the origins of the universe.\n\nSo last year I began learning more about these subjects partly by reading popular books written for laymen by original scientists such as Einstein, Feynman and Hawking, and supplementing them with more technical online courses and a lot of independent research on the Internet. While this reading clearly hasn\u2019t made me an expert in any of these areas, I do feel I have managed to satiate a lot of the initial curiosity I felt about the origins and working of our universe.\n\nI am also incubating a startup in a subject area I\u2019ve always been passionate about: how very young children learn to read. Many years ago, I came across a research project that used automatic speech recognition technology to provide a helpful and fun computer-based reading tutor program. The goal of the startup is to pick up where this research program ended and make a commercial product.\n\nI\u2019m having a lot of fun working on this project. If we make the technology breakthroughs we hope to make, we truly will impact how millions of young children across the globe learn to read in their early years.\n\n\u2014Umang Gupta, San Mateo, Calif.\n\nThere have been so many books written on the subject but I was genuinely surprised about the following three experiences:\n\nFrom everything I had read, I was expecting to make personal adjustments after retirement because of the loss of the daily routines of a job. It was very surprising to encounter the depth of the loss of not being part of a team doing important work. I didn\u2019t realize how much personal satisfaction came from being a key member of a team of people working to solve difficult problems in industry.\n\nDuring retirement, I had the expectation of more time with my wife. What surprised me was that, even after more than four decades together, there was still so much about her that I did not know. This thing this could go on forever.\n\nI expected that working with grandchildren after retirement would be somewhat like the experiences with our own children. It seems incredible that I did not fully realize that grandchildren\u2019s lives are the responsibility of their parents. The grandparents can only be part-time advisers in the raising of grandchildren.\n\n\u2014Patrick Butler, Lawrence, Kan.\n\nBefore I retired I made a list of things that I would like to do once I retired. One thing on the list was getting a puppy. I have loved dogs all my life but because of job commitments I didn\u2019t have the time to take care of a dog properly.\n\nOnce I retired, I got an eight-week old Brittany spaniel puppy. This was exactly what I needed. The puppy kept me busy with training, taking him for walks, and playing with him. Once he was about 1\u00bd years old, I decided to get another puppy. At my local Humane Society I found a three-month-old Lab/Great Dane cross and immediately adopted him.\n\nGetting my two dogs has been the best thing I have ever done. I have met so many wonderful people when I take the dogs for walks. Also it is definitely good for my health as I lost about 30 pounds and my blood pressure dropped to where it should be and I stopped taking blood-pressure medication.\n\n\u2014David Antonison, Cambridge, Ontario\n\nWhat became abundantly clear to me shortly after I stepped over the retirement threshold was that I was no longer a member of my longtime cherished team.\n\nAlthough my experience in the corporate world developed valued skill sets\u2014leadership, business acuity, organizational know-how, team building, and experiential insights built over a long career\u2014these attributes no longer seem to generate much enthusiasm within the charitable rank and file. I see myself as the battle-tested general, hunkered down in the retirement foxhole, barking out orders to nonexistent troops.\n\nI do my utmost to ignore the fact that I have become a charter member of the over-the-hill club, unattached to the business world, a retiree with a gold whatchamacallit for my long-term services. Yet, on the brighter side, I believe that with most downsides in life, there is an offsetting upside out there if you look hard enough.\n\nFor example, in many restaurants I now qualify for a carefully scripted selection of certain breakfast or lunch items. Like Pavlov\u2019s dog, the minute the menu is presented, I now automatically look for the asterisk and associated micro-sized type on the bottom of the back page of the menu. Serendipitously, I find that I qualify for modestly reduced prices and smaller portions of food. If one is determined to become the poster child for weight-loss ads or perhaps embark on a mild form of starvation, this is a wonderful option.\n\nOverall, I now look back with some regret when I examine my motives for getting off the corporate train. Can\u2019t help but wonder if I made a mistake.

Mick Mulvaney drew criticism after acknowledging a nanny-tax issue involving a former household employee. Photo: Aaron P. Bernstein/Bloomberg News\n\nAfter a long absence, nanny taxes are back in the headlines.\n\nNanny taxes don\u2019t just apply to nannies. The term is shorthand for federal and state employment taxes required of many people who hire nannies, housekeepers, cooks, drivers and other household employees and who pay them more than a certain amount.\n\nJournal Report Podcast Subscribe to the Journal Report podcast at wsj.com, on iTunes or Google Play Music.\n\nThe subject rarely draws much attention until someone in the news, such as a presidential nominee for a high-level government post, admits a problem. The latest stories to emerge involve Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R., S.C.), President Donald Trump \u2019s choice to run the Office of Management and Budget, and Andy Puzder, who was nominated to be labor secretary but later withdrew from consideration for the post.\n\nShortly after Mr. Mulvaney was nominated, he disclosed he hadn\u2019t paid more than $15,000 in taxes for a household employee hired from 2000 to 2004 to help care for the family\u2019s triplets. He said he hadn\u2019t realized the worker qualified as an employee. He also said he recently paid the federal taxes and promised to take care of everything else owed. Mr. Puzder, chief executive of CKE Restaurants, didn\u2019t pay taxes for an undocumented worker he employed as a housekeeper for a few years but did so after he was nominated, a spokesman for the executive said recently. Mr. Puzder said he had been unaware the housekeeper wasn\u2019t legally permitted to work in the U.S.\n\nIn the past, nanny-tax-related issues have cost prominent figures\u2014such as Zoe Baird, President Clinton\u2019s choice to be attorney general in the early 1990s\u2014their chance to serve in high-profile jobs. What happens with the Mulvaney nomination remains to be seen. But tax experts say many readers should pay attention whether or not they dream of landing a top job in Washington.\n\nIt can be dangerous for employers to assume they won\u2019t get caught. For example, trouble sometimes erupts when employers and employees part ways. Nevertheless, the number of people who file the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s \u201cSchedule H\u201d for household employment taxes has fallen sharply. The nanny tax \u201cappears to have fallen off the compliance radar screen\u201d for many taxpayers, says Martin Hall, a partner at the Ropes & Gray law firm in Boston and head of its private client group.\n\nIgnorance of the law may play a role in noncompliance. People who hire household workers for the first time may not be aware of all the rules, such as how to define a household \u201cemployee,\u201d says Guy Maddalone, founder and chief executive officer of GTM Payroll Services Inc. and author of \u201cHow to Hire a Nanny: A Household HR Handbook.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a suggestion for busy people who want to comply but can\u2019t stand all the time-consuming paperwork hassles: Turn to a professional company, such as GTM or many others, to handle the job. For the do-it-yourself crowd, keep in mind that the rules \u201ccan be tricky\u201d and include important exceptions, says Greg Rosica, a tax partner at Ernst & Young LLP in Tampa, Fla., and a contributor to the \u201cEY Tax Guide.\u201d\n\nAndy Puzder said he paid back taxes for a former housekeeper after being nominated for labor Secretary. He later withdrew from consideration for the post. Photo: Jack Plunkett/Associated Press\n\nHere are a few key points:\n\nNanny tax rules apply to household \u201cemployees,\u201d but not \u201cindependent contractors.\u201d What\u2019s the difference? \u201cThe worker is your employee if you can control not only what work is done, but how it is done,\u201d the IRS says in Publication 926. \u201cIf only the worker can control how the work is done, the worker isn\u2019t your employee but is self-employed. A self-employed worker usually provides his or her own tools and offers services to the general public in an independent business.\u201d\n\nAlso, if an agency provides the worker and controls what work is done and how, \u201cthe worker isn\u2019t your employee.\u201d\n\nGenerally, for 2016 and 2017, an employer needs to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes for \u201ccash wages\u201d of $2,000 or more paid to any one employee. Cash wages refer to checks, money orders and the like. They don\u2019t include \u201cthe value of food, lodging, clothing, transit passes and other noncash items you give your household employee.\u201d But cash given to an employee in place of those items counts as cash wages.\n\nPREVIOUS TAXES COLUMNS\n\nDon\u2019t count wages paid to your spouse or your child under 21, the IRS says. Wages paid to your parent typically don\u2019t apply, either, although there are exceptions.\n\nDon\u2019t count wages paid to an employee under 18 at any time during the year, unless providing household services is \u201cthe employee\u2019s principal occupation,\u201d the IRS says. If the employee is a student, \u201cproviding household services isn\u2019t considered to be his or her principal occupation.\u201d\n\nFor details on how much to pay and on the federal unemployment tax, known as FUTA, see Table 1 on page 4 of Publication 926. Table 2 has a handy household employer\u2019s checklist of what to do for those with a household employee.\n\nAsk your state unemployment-tax agency for the rules on state unemployment tax. Also check out the rules on other state employment taxes or requirements for workers\u2019 compensation insurance.\n\nDon\u2019t focus solely on tax issues. Make sure you have arranged for all the proper insurance coverage needed to protect you and people working in your home, says Mr. Hall of Ropes & Gray. \u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot more to this than just filling out tax forms. Shortcuts can prove expensive,\u201d he warns.\n\nMr. Herman is a writer in New York City. He was formerly The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Tax Report columnist.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nAn increasing number of seniors are choosing to get their Medicare benefits through Medicare Advantage plans. But do they understand what they\u2019re signing up for?\n\nA recent report suggests they may not, especially when it comes to which hospitals are included in the plans\u2019 networks.\n\nAn alternative to traditional Medicare and administered by private insurers, Medicare Advantage plans are typically health maintenance organizations or preferred provider organizations that offer seniors hospital and medical coverage (Medicare Part A and Part B), and sometimes prescription-drug coverage (Medicare Part D), dental care or benefits such as gym memberships.\n\nThese plans typically offer lower out-of-pocket costs than traditional government-run Medicare in exchange for members using in-network doctors and hospitals.\n\nThe problem, according to the report from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, is that the size and composition of hospital networks varies greatly among plans, yet that isn\u2019t always apparent to those shopping for coverage. Plan directories contain incorrect, confusing or outdated information about which hospitals and specialty institutes are included in networks, the study found, and the directories can be difficult to navigate. One directory featured 600 pages without a table of contents or index, it said.\n\nUsing the directories to pick a plan is \u201clike trying to do your taxes with an abacus; it can be done, but not easily,\u201d says Gretchen Jacobson, associate director at the Kaiser Family Foundation and co-author of the report, adding that Medicare\u2019s website doesn\u2019t provide an easy way to compare plan networks side by side.\n\nNot created equal\n\nAbout 17 million beneficiaries, roughly 30% of the Medicare population, enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan in 2015, according to the Congressional Budget Office, which expects private-plan enrollment to grow to about 29 million Americans, or about 40% of the Medicare population, in 2025.\n\nMany seniors like Advantage plans because in addition to added benefits such as dental coverage and gym memberships, they eliminate the need for additional insurance, such as Medigap, and some plans cover the gap in Medicare prescription-drug coverage known as the \u201cDonut Hole.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese sorts of benefits can make a big difference to someone on a fixed income,\u201d says Clare Krusing, a spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, an industry group.\n\nThat said, some Advantage plan members can face significant expenses if they seek treatment out of the network, experts say, which is why having a clear understanding of the size and composition of each plan\u2019s network is important.\n\nOf the 409 plans studied by Kaiser, 23% offered what the report termed broad networks, meaning 70% or more of the hospitals in a county were included. About 61% had medium-size networks, meaning between 30% and 69% of all hospitals in a county were included; and about 16% had narrow networks, with less than 30%.\n\nWhile some plans with narrow networks get good ratings from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid based on metrics such as preventive care and customer service, the Kaiser study found that in general they are more likely to exclude institutions that specialize in treating rare or more complicated conditions.\n\nAccording to the report, 75% of narrow networks excluded National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers, which have experience handling rare and complicated cancers and provide more access to clinical trials; 49% excluded academic medical centers; and 21% had no hospitals with an accredited cancer program.\n\nIn the worst case, by not including certain institutions, networks can be built to exclude the sickest, most expensive patients, says Karen Davis, a professor and director of Roger C. Lipitz Center for Integrated Health Care at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nThe insurance industry\u2019s Ms. Krusing says some plans may exclude brand-name hospitals from their networks if there is no evidence they provide better care than cheaper community or regional hospitals. Medicare Advantage plans are increasingly enrolling patients with chronic illnesses, focusing on preventive care and reducing avoidable hospitalizations, she says.\n\nShopping experience\n\nWhatever the merits of the various plans, experts say it\u2019s easy for the details to get lost in the generally weak shopping experience they offer.\n\nThe Kaiser report found, among other things, that some plan directories mislabeled rehabilitation or post acute-care facilities as hospitals, while others included hospitals that had been closed for several years.\n\nA separate analysis prepared for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and presented at a conference in Baltimore in September, found a 46% chance that an Advantage plan\u2019s listing of a primary-care physician, oncologist, ophthalmologist or cardiologist contained some sort of inaccuracy, including where the provider was located or whether they were accepting new patients.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t shop around very well,\u201d says Timothy Layton, an assistant professor of health-care policy at Harvard Medical School. Trying to anticipate what specialty care may be needed in the coming year, along with calculating deductibles, copays and other out-of-pocket costs makes the task even more difficult, he adds.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and insurers say they are beginning to address this problem.\n\n\u201cWe are actively working with insurers and the provider community to further develop best practices and solutions,\u201d says CMS spokesman Raymond Thorn.\n\nIn 2017, plans that apply to expand their networks will have to submit their entire network for review by CMS. Currently, CMS examines provider networks for accuracy of listings in new geographic areas to which a plan is expanding, or in response to triggers such as complaints, changes of ownership or termination of a large provider.\u200b\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cseniors may have to do some additional work to make sure they chose the best plan for them,\u201d says James Cosgrove, director of health care at GAO. Ask questions about which providers are in which networks, Dr. Cosgrove says.\n\nRobert A Berenson, a fellow at the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, recommends asking how frequently a plan refers patients out of its network. Medicare Advantage plans are often reimbursed at a rate close to that of traditional Medicare patients even if a provider is out of network, he says.\n\nDr. Jacobson recommends State Health Insurance Assistance Programs, or SHIPS, for help choosing a plan. These programs provide free insurance counseling to Medicare beneficiaries in all 50 states.\n\nMs. Ward is a writer in Mendham, N.J.

Above, a brokerage house in Beijing in March. Photo: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg News\n\nBEIJING\u2014 Zhou Ping, a Shanghai-based asset manager, finds himself increasingly fielding this question from across the Pacific: How does China matter to my 401(k)?\n\nThe question might seem odd when you consider that U.S. fund managers and other guardians of Americans\u2019 retirement plans are largely \u201cunderweight\u201d on China, meaning they allocate a smaller percentage of the portfolios they manage to Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong and New York compared with global benchmarks.\n\nMainland-traded stocks and bonds aren\u2019t even included in influential suites of indexes compiled by MSCI Inc. and others and tracked by international portfolio managers because of China\u2019s capital controls.\n\nDespite the limited exposure foreign investors have to China\u2019s stocks, bonds and currency, the country\u2019s markets are exerting themselves on the U.S. and other global markets. In the past 13 months, two bouts of rapid yuan depreciation have sent global markets tumbling. The influence, many say, comes from doubts about Beijing\u2019s ability to steer the world\u2019s second-largest economy toward sustainable growth.\n\n\u201cNo one can live with China instability,\u201d says Mr. Zhou, founder of Bin Yuan Capital Ltd., which manages more than $400 million for U.S. pension funds, college endowments and other institutional investors.\n\nOutsize impact\n\nA continued Chinese slowdown and a drop in Chinese demand would depress the prices of everything from oil and iron ore to Apple Inc. shares\u2014a fixture in many Americans\u2019 pension plans.\n\nPart of the impact also arises from Beijing\u2019s efforts to integrate the country\u2019s markets more closely with the rest of the world. To draw more investors from abroad as growth slows, Chinese authorities have increased quotas granted to foreign investors and made it easier for them to purchase mainland-listed stocks via a trading link with Hong Kong.\n\nBut investors in the U.S. and other countries remain skittish about putting money into China. One worry is that money can\u2019t move freely in and out of China. In fact, the government has tightened restrictions on funds leaving China\u2019s shores since late last year to prevent outflows. That, combined with an epic government-led market-intervention debacle last summer, contributed to MSCI\u2019s decision in June not to add mainland Chinese A-shares to its indexes.\n\nOf concern to U.S. investors is the yuan, often seen as a measure of Beijing\u2019s ability to manage the economy. China\u2019s shifting exchange-rate policies over the past year\u2014marked by two surprise devaluations, in August 2015 and January, respectively\u2014have spurred speculation that the economy is worsening faster than indicated by official data. In recent months, China\u2019s central bank has improved communication with the market about its yuan-pricing system, helping ease some nervousness.\n\nHowever, fears remain that Beijing might have to resort to sharp currency devaluation to help prop up growth if the economy decelerates further next year. \u201cChina\u2019s exchange-rate policy is one of the top issues raised by U.S. investors,\u201d says Mr. Zhou, a former portfolio manager with General Electric Co. \u2019s asset-management arm. \u201cHow China manages the currency shows how well it is managing the economy.\u201d\n\nThe MSCI wait\n\nFor now, U.S. investors\u2019 direct exposure to China mainly comes from Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong and New York, such as internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , telecommunication company China Mobile Ltd. , and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. Those companies now make up a quarter of MSCI\u2019s Emerging Markets Index, giving China the biggest country weighting in the benchmark. But those Chinese shares make up only 2.7% of MSCI\u2019s overall global index. And they currently also represent \u201cthe biggest underweight\u201d positions among global mutual funds, according to UBS Group AG, as investors are wary of unpredictable policy moves and a soft economy.\n\nIt may just be a matter of time before shares listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen get included in MSCI\u2019s indexes, many investors and analysts say, pointing to China\u2019s stated goal of opening its markets. Such inclusion means international money managers tracking the indexes would have to add A shares to portfolios. Mainland shares are less liquid and more expensive than their overseas counterparts.\n\nChi Lo, China economist at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, the asset-management arm of the Paris-based bank, estimates that A shares will account for about 20% of MSCI\u2019s Emerging Markets Index if they get fully included.\n\n\u201cIt matters more to U.S. managers than to other foreign investors because the U.S. managers are more underweight A shares than the others,\u201d Mr. Lo says. (Currently, U.S. investors can only buy A shares with quotas approved by Chinese authorities.)\n\nHowever, if other markets are any indication, the road to full A-share inclusion is likely to be a long one.\n\nFor instance, it took Taiwan and South Korea more than 10 years to have their stocks fully included in the MSCI indexes. For China, financial liberalization has already taken a back seat to maintaining stability amid the continued slowdown. Some say if China further eases repatriation of funds and meets other requirements set by MSCI, some 5% of A shares could be added to the emerging-markets index in the near term. If that happens, mainland equities would represent about 1% of the index.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a big deal eventually, but not in the short term,\u201d Mr. Lo says.\n\nMs. Wei is a Wall Street Journal special writer in Beijing.

Photo: Ryan Graham\n\nLike a Broadway critic deciding to write a play, a blogger who complained about fund fees decided to start an exchange-traded fund. He discovered that keeping expenses low isn\u2019t as easy as it seems.\n\nEddy Elfenbein decided last year to launch a fund based on the stock picks from his more than decade-old Crossing Wall Street blog, written from Washington, D.C. Mr. Elfenbein recommends 20 stocks on his buy list and then sticks with them through the next 12 months. Each year, he changes just five of the holdings for the next year.\n\nBecause of the success of his choices\u2014he posts returns on his blog\u2014he built up a Twitter following of around 25,000, many of whom asked over the years if he managed money.\n\nHis fund, AdvisorShares Focused Equity ETF, launched Sept. 21, 2016, under the ticker CWS, for Crossing Wall Street.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just the Twitter-led impetus that makes the fund unusual; the fee structure is as well. Mr. Elfenbein has to beat the benchmark index or else give back part of his fee. If he exceeds it, he gets more.\n\nHe spoke with The Wall Street Journal about his experience setting up the fund. Edited excerpts of the conversation follow:\n\nWSJ: When and why did you decide to do this?\n\nMR. ELFENBEIN: I built a following based on what I recommended. If Twitter wasn\u2019t around, I don\u2019t know if this could have happened.\n\nAs the years passed, I had more people asking if I managed money, which I didn\u2019t. So late last year I met with AdvisorShares [an actively managed ETF sponsor] to see if it was possible to develop a product that tracked the buy list.\n\nWSJ: What surprised you about the process of starting an ETF?\n\nMR. ELFENBEIN: I always complain about the fees for ETFs and mutual funds.\n\nBut when you are on the other end of the process creating a fund\u2014with so many fees, lawyer fees, exchange fees, etc.\u2014the question is how can we get them so low. [Currently the fund has annual expenses of 0.75%. That compares with an average expense ratio of 0.86% for actively managed U.S. stock ETFs, according to Morningstar Inc. data.]\n\nI was also surprised by how little capital the fund needs to be viable. Advisor Shares points out that the patient is alive on the table if you have $20 million in the fund. Ideally, you would want to have more. With $50 million under management, then you\u2019d have something that is chugging along.\n\nWSJ: Will having an ETF get in the way of the blog?\n\nMR. ELFENBEIN: No. I can write about the stocks I recommend, but I have to steer clear of anything that smacks of marketing the fund.\n\nThe ETF is going to track the buy list as closely as possible, with the picks equally weighted as much as SEC regulations allow. The positions will be rebalanced once a year. We have to keep a small cash position due to the mechanics of the fund; we\u2019ll start with 2%.\n\nWSJ: You\u2019ve done something different in terms of the way you are going to be paid. Please explain.\n\nMR. ELFENBEIN: There will be a fulcrum fee for me. My pay will be based on performance relative to the S&P 500. If the fund beats the benchmark, I get a bonus; if not, then I get a penalty. The size of the penalty is a based on a sliding scale and would result a reduction in the fund\u2019s expenses.\n\nThe hedge funds just get bonuses. If they miss their benchmark they don\u2019t get penalized.\n\nWSJ: Why an ETF instead of a mutual fund?\n\nMR. ELFENBEIN: It just seems that investors are voting with their dollars. We are moving from the world of mutual funds to ETFs. There are tax benefits with the ETFs. [They are less subject to capital-gains taxes than mutual funds, for example.] I also like the fact that you can track the value during the day, whereas you can\u2019t with a mutual fund.\n\nPlus, a lot of funds are very secretive about what they own. I\u2019m the opposite. My buy list is completely free. So you get the complete transparency that you get with ETFs.\n\nHere\u2019s an odd comparison: Years ago bands were trying to clamp down on bootleg tapes of concerts. The one group that was the opposite was the Grateful Dead, who reserved spaces for the people taping.\n\nI don\u2019t see how the transparency hurts me at all.\n\nMr. Constable is a writer in New York.

But many no-load funds are still tied to fees. Illustration: Richard Borge for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMutual-fund investors may soon see changes on the shelves of fund supermarkets: No-load share classes are likely to dominate the offerings because of a new government conflict-of-interest rule aimed at financial advisers.\n\nThe rule, which takes effect in April and requires advisers offering retirement-investment advice to put clients\u2019 needs ahead of their own, is expected to reshape the distribution of mutual funds and accelerate the demise of loads, or the fees fund firms charge investors to compensate brokers for selling the funds.\n\nOn its face, it is a positive development for investors, who likely will be able to buy funds more cheaply and better understand what they are paying for.\n\nPersistence of 12b-1 fees\n\nBut there is still reason for investors to be wary. Many no-load funds will continue to carry marketing or distribution charges known as 12b-1 fees, embedded in the fund\u2019s expense ratio. A fund can charge investors a 12b-1 fee of 0.25% annually and still call itself a no-load or no-commission fund.\n\nAmong the 19,598 noninstitutional mutual-fund share classes tracked by investment researcher Morningstar, 4,218 charge no loads and no 12b-1 fees. (Most are available only in certain 401(k) plans or through financial advisers who charge by assets under management, Morningstar says.) An additional 2,485 share classes have no loads but charge 12b-1 fees of 0.25% a year, or $250 a year for every $100,000 invested.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s messy to have these sales charges wrapped up in the fund\u2019s expenses,\u201d says John Rekenthaler, vice president of research at Morningstar. Investors would have a clearer idea of what they\u2019re paying and to whom if distribution costs were separated completely from investment-management costs, he says.\n\nSome experts say that over time, the Labor Department\u2019s new fiduciary rule and an era of greater transparency could begin chipping away at 12b-1 distribution fees just as they have with loads.\n\nLoads have been under pressure for years, leading fund companies in many cases to waive them. The new fiduciary rule is adding to the pressure by encouraging distributors\u2014including fund supermarkets (platforms that permit investors to buy and sell funds from hundreds of companies), major brokerage firms, independent and regional broker-dealers, and bank-and-trust companies\u2014to add no-load-fund share classes to their offerings.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2015, investors pulled more than $641 billion from load share classes and invested $1.42 trillion in new money in no-load share classes, according to the Investment Company Institute, a mutual-fund trade group. This year through September, investors have pulled an estimated net $113 billion from mutual fund A shares, or those that charge a sales fee up front, Morningstar says.\n\nMany investment managers, meanwhile, are preparing for the possibility of an even more sweeping rule next year. The Securities and Exchange Commission may require brokerage firms and advisers to apply the fiduciary standard across the board to all investors, says Denise Valentine, a senior analyst on wealth management at Aite Group.\n\nTo better position themselves, many mutual-fund companies are filing with regulators to create lower-fee or no-load share classes or discussing with their distributors what type of share class they want to offer clients.\n\nDo it the ETF way?\n\nFor now, distributors continue to embrace fund share classes with 12b-1 distribution fees.\n\nPhoto: Stockphoto/Getty Images\n\nBroker Charles Schwab Corp. stopped selling fund share classes with front-end sales loads in May, but continues to offer an array of funds \u201cwith and without a 12b-1\u201d fees, it says. The firm declined to reveal how much of its business comes from share classes with 12b-1 fees.\n\nIt would be much clearer for investors, says Mr. Rekenthaler, if the brokerage firm itself charged the distribution fee, and fund companies stopped wrapping it in with their expenses. \u201cThat\u2019s how it works with an ETF.\u201d\n\nCapital Group\u2019s American Funds appears headed in that direction.\n\nIn late October, the firm filed with regulators to create a new fund share class that will be free of commissions, 12b-1 fees and so-called \u201csub-transfer-agency fees,\u201d which are typically paid to a transfer agent for mundane tasks such as calculating cost basis. The firm hopes to offer the new share class early next year.\n\n\u201cThis is our first offering to the individual investor that will have a management-fee structure as opposed to any structure that will go back to compensate for any expense or 12b-1, etc.,\u201d says Matthew O\u2019Connor, head of distribution at American Funds.\n\nThe new environment is demanding fee transparency and simplicity, he says.\n\nSales of fund shares with 12b-1 fees also are diminishing at Prudential Investments, part of the investment-management business of Prudential Financial Inc. The firm says two share classes that charge no loads or 12b-1 fees now account for 75% of the firm\u2019s gross sales.\n\nLegg Mason Global Asset Management declined to break out its sales by load or no-load fund shares classes, but says about three-quarters of new inflows in recent years have gone to two share classes that charge no loads or 12b-1 fees.\n\nAt the end of the day, the client will have to pay for distribution, but it\u2019s likely to be a clearly disclosed charge, says Ms. Valentine of the Aite Group.\n\nMs. Maxey is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

U.S.-stock funds fell 2.5% on average in the month. Photo: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg News\n\nStock funds, whether focused on the U.S. or the rest of the world, pulled back in October. Now, with less than two months to go in 2017, there is no assurance that either flavor will be able to register gains for the full year.\n\nThe election, of course, is the wild card.\n\nThe average diversified U.S.-stock mutual fund posted a total return of minus 2.5% in October, trimming the year-to-date total return to 3.7%, according to data from Thomson Reuters Corp. \u2019s Lipper unit.\n\nInternational-stock funds fell 2.3%, and through October were barely holding on to a year-to-date gain, at 1%.\n\nMany investors were frozen ahead of the election despite better-than-expected corporate earnings.\n\nBond-focused funds also pulled back. Funds focused on intermediate-maturity, investment-grade debt, the most commonly held type of fixed-income bonds, fell 0.7% in the month, but the category still has a year-to-date return of 5.1%.\n\nDespite that gain, many bond investors aren\u2019t sitting tight. For much of the year, they had pushed up bond prices as they hunted for whatever yield they could get. But bracing for a Fed rate increase, they pulled record amounts from some popular exchange-traded junk-bond funds in October, The Wall Street Journal reported. And indeed, as November began, the Fed indicated a rate rise could come in December.\n\nSuch an increase won\u2019t be much of a shock for investors at this point, says Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the private-client group of U.S. Bank in Helena, Mont. In fact, with the rate increase being so expected, plus modestly positive earnings and the end of a divisive election, \u201cwe continue to expect the S&P 500 to be positive at year-end, likely to move higher in the postelection period just due to the resolution of uncertainty,\u201d he says.\n\nInvestors still will be left navigating a low-rate environment, says Mr. Northey, who sees municipal bonds holding value relative to Treasurys for taxable investors.\n\nThe sobering election-year news for investors is that stocks tend to rise in the 12 months leading up to a presidential election and slow down in the year that follows. John A. Prestbo, a former Wall Street Journal editor who used to oversee details about the Dow Jones Industrial Average, writes about that 120-year trend.\n\nAmong the hardest-hit sectors in the month was real-estate funds, popular among ETF investors, with an average decline of 4.7%, trimming the year-to-date gain to 4.4%. Gold-oriented funds dropped 7.6%, though they are still up an average of 82.4% for the year.\n\nMr. Power is a Wall Street Journal news editor in South Brunswick, N.J.

Not necessarily, say most experts. But investors should be aware of it, so that they can adjust their holdings if necessary to better align with their investment goals and risk tolerance.\n\nTarget-date funds, which automatically adjust their stock/bond/cash mix as time passes, are designed to invest heavily in stocks early in an investor\u2019s working life, when he or she presumably can better tolerate stock-market risk. Then, the funds slowly shift to a more conservative mix. It\u2019s a strategy for helping people avert a savings shortfall\u2014but also one that fails to account for individual differences in risk tolerance, an investor\u2019s other assets or really anything besides age.\n\nSo, regardless of how they might feel about it, people who plan to retire in 2020 could now have an equity allocation of around 60% in target-date funds managed by Wells Fargo, T. Rowe Price and Fidelity Investments, among others. While many plan participants pay little attention to such details, \u201cit\u2019s really important that people understand what they are invested in, because asset allocation is a key driver of returns,\u201d says Peter Andersen, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co., a Boston-based wealth-advisory and investment-management firm.\n\nPeople who feel queasy about taking that much equity risk might switch to holding more cash or bonds outside an employer-sponsored retirement plan, or consult an adviser for an overall mix that might help them sleep better without sabotaging their long-term savings strategy, financial experts say.\n\nA dominant force\n\nTarget-date funds have become a major way Americans save for retirement since the Labor Department about a decade ago said that if retirement-plan participants didn\u2019t designate how their contributions should be invested, the money could automatically be channeled into target-date funds.\n\nOf nearly 20 million participants in plans overseen by Fidelity, 69% own a target-date fund. About 44% of those investors have all of their assets in such a fund.\n\nFidelity\u2019s funds are designed to help investors accumulate enough money to maintain the same standard of living after retiring, says Andrew Dierdorf, who helps manage the funds. While there always will be market volatility, investor holdings in target-date funds recover from downturns over long periods, he says\u2014even as severe as the one in 2008 and 2009, he adds. Aside from the strategic downward glide path in equity exposure, Fidelity also modestly tweaks allocations in its funds based on market developments.\n\nT. Rowe Price, another large administrator of retirement plans, offers two target-date strategies. One puts the stock allocation at 55% at the retirement date, while a newer one has a lower 42.5% equities holding at that date. People who expect to make a lump-sum withdrawal from their plan at retirement sometimes prefer a lower stock allocation because they believe that such an approach will provide more certainty about having adequate funds then. But analysis looking back over multiple market periods suggests that a fund with a higher equity allocation actually will produce better results, the firm has concluded.\n\nWells Fargo says its target-date funds maintain a \u201cmeaningful\u201d level of equities exposure to help investors reach their retirement goals, while using volatility-management tools to help moderate the impact of short-term market gyrations on portfolios.\n\nThe pluses and minuses\n\nInvestors in the target-date funds offered by retirement plans typically get better returns than other mutual-fund investors, according to research by Morningstar Inc. That\u2019s because retirement plans automatically deduct money from every paycheck and use it to buy more shares of a fund, regardless of whether markets are up or down. That means some of the purchases are made after prices have fallen to more attractive levels because of a market correction.\n\nWithout such discipline, fundholders often halt investing\u2014or even pull money out\u2014after prices have fallen and buy after prices already have risen, says Jeff Holt, associate director for manager research at Morningstar.\n\nCaption text here Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThat analysis may not reassure plan participants whose life savings have taken a hit in a major market downdraft, though. In 2008, some target-date 2040 funds lost about as much as the 39% plunge in the S&P 500 index. Many of those same funds now have equity allocations north of 80%, so they could lose 8% or more in value if stocks broadly fell about 10%, notes Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual-fund research at CFRA, a provider of financial data and analysis.\n\nStill, financial experts caution that people who are fearful about market volatility should think twice before shifting to a significantly more conservative allocation in a 401(k) plan. Many Americans already are well behind in meeting their retirement income goals.\n\nNot meeting those goals really is the risk those people face, \u201cnot the roller-coaster ride in the markets,\u201d says Josh Cohen, who heads the defined-contribution area at Russell Investments.\n\nMr. Pollock is a writer in Ridgewood, N.J.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nAs investors have taken on more risk, so-called quality stocks have in recent months been beaten by their antithesis\u2014so-called junk stocks.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect it to last.\n\nQuality on Wall Street generally refers to companies that rank the highest according to measures of financial safety, profitability and growth. Such companies typically also pay a dividend. Numerous academic studies have documented that the stocks of such companies have, over the long term, significantly outperformed the so-called junk stocks at the opposite end of the spectrum. (The most-cited of such studies was by researchers at Greenwich, Conn.-based AQR Capital Management, \u201cQuality Minus Junk.\u201d)\n\nNot this year. Take Walt Disney, the entertainment giant, which many consider to be a \u201cquality\u201d company: It has a long and consistent record of turning a profit, pays a handsome dividend and sports an S&P Quality Rank of A-plus. This year through October, Disney\u2019s stock lost 11.1%, even after taking dividends into account, in contrast to a 5.9% gain for the S&P 500.\n\nAt the opposite end of the quality/junk spectrum, in several ways, is Autodesk, the computer-aided-design company. It lost money in fiscal 2016, is projected by FactSet to lose even more in fiscal 2017 and pays no dividend. Its S&P Quality Ranking is C, the lowest. Its stock has nonetheless has risen 18.6% this year.\n\nQuality counts\n\nTo be sure, not all quality stocks have lost money this year, just as not all junk stocks have risen. But Disney\u2019s and Autodesk\u2019s experience isn\u2019t unique. Junk\u2019s recent superiority has been particularly evident among smaller-cap stocks, such as those represented by the Russell 2000 index. According to Len Haussler, co-founder of Cincinnati-based Opus Capital Management, companies in this index that are losing money gained 7.1 percentage points more in the third quarter than the profitable ones.\n\nThere are two reasons why investors nevertheless shouldn\u2019t give up on quality. The first: Quality stocks\u2019 performance relative to junk tends to be the highest when the broad market is falling, according to Andrea Frazzini, one of the authors of the seminal AQR study on quality and junk; he is an adjunct finance professor at New York University and a principal at AQR. It therefore is hardly surprising that junk recently has beaten quality, he says, because bull-market conditions have largely prevailed.\n\nDuring the 2007-09 bear market, however, quality stocks on average beat junk stocks by more than 20 percentage points, according to AQR data. They beat them by more than 50 percentage points during the 2000-02 bear market that came as the Internet-stock bubble was bursting.\n\nThe second reason not to give up on quality stocks: Such stocks currently have far lower valuations than do junk stocks. So in betting that quality will outperform junk, you also are betting that cheaper stocks will beat more expensive ones.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s doing\n\nHow cheap are quality stocks right now?\n\nOne measure comes from Steven DeSanctis, a small-cap and midcap-focused equity strategist at Jefferies, the New York-based investment-banking firm. He defines the quality category to include the 20% of stocks with the highest return on equity. He says that, relative to the 20% of stocks with the smallest return on equity, the average quality stock\u2019s price-to-sales ratio is lower today than at any time since mid-2000. That earlier time, of course, was when the stock market was just beginning to work off the excesses of the internet bubble.\n\nBoth Mr. Haussler and Mr. DeSanctis say the Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative-easing program is largely to blame for quality stocks being so cheap. They argue that the Fed\u2019s monetary stimulus in effect promotes risk taking and thus reduces quality stocks\u2019 attractiveness. Since both advisers believe that risk could rear its head at any time, they recommend that we not only stick with quality stocks but consider even increasing our investments in them.\n\nIn fact, you would want to give up on quality only if you think that the economy and the stock market have hit a \u201cpermanently high plateau,\u201d to quote the famous words from Irving Fisher, the 1920s economist who made this fateful prediction just weeks before the 1929 stock-market crash. Otherwise, history teaches us, over any complete cycle encompassing both a bull and a bear market, quality stocks will handily beat junk stocks.\n\nFinding quality\n\nOne of the easiest ways to invest in a diversified basket of quality stocks is via an exchange-traded fund. Two of the larger such offerings are iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor (QUAL), with an annual expense ratio of 0.15%, or $15 per $10,000 invested, and PowerShares S&P 500 Quality Portfolio PowerShares S&P 500 Quality Portfolio (SPHQ) with a 0.29% expense ratio.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to do a lot of legwork if you\u2019d rather invest in individual quality stocks, since you need to analyze and compare a large number of companies according to a host of different metrics.\n\nHere are the five smallest-cap stocks within the S&P 500 that rank above-average in terms of returns on assets, five-year growth rate on return on assets and dividend payout rates\u2014and that are below average in terms of market cap, price-to-book ratios and five-year betas: Avery Dennison (AVY), Darden Restaurants (DRI), Kohl\u2019s (KSS), H&R Block (HRB), and Leggett & Platt (LEG).\n\nMr. Hulbert is editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest and a senior columnist for MarketWatch.

The rally pushed the total return of the average diversified U.S.-stock fund to 10.8% for 2016, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data. U.S.-stock funds had been up only 3.7% through October.\n\nEven more striking were the fund flows after Election Day. For most of the year, investors had been sending their cash to bond-focused funds, and moving it out of stock funds.\n\nBut in November and December, an estimated $45.67 billion flowed to mutual funds and exchange-traded funds investing in U.S. stocks, while about $14.68 billion flowed out of bond funds, based on Investment Company Institute data through Dec. 28, the latest available.\n\nHere is how abrupt the change was: The full-year results for fund flows still look like it was a \u201cBond Year for the Ages\u201d because of how strong the bond rally was during the first three quarters: For all of 2016, a net $193 billion flowed to bond mutual funds and ETFs, according to the estimates, and $62.91 billion flowed out of U.S.-stock funds.\n\nSimilarly, the performance of bond funds was positive for 2016 despite ending weakly. Funds focused on intermediate-maturity, investment-grade debt, the most commonly held type, rose 3.0% for the year after absorbing a 2.7% fourth-quarter drop.\n\nAnd no surprise: Funds focusing on international stocks were trumped by U.S.-focused ones. International-stock funds rose just 0.7% in 2016, undercut by a minus-2.6% fourth quarter.\n\nGold-oriented funds were another example of how several investments and sectors did a sudden reversal\u2014either up or down\u2014after Donald Trump \u2019s election. Investors ditched gold as they pivoted to a more-positive view of economic growth in the wake of the election, and the gold funds dropped 21.4% for the fourth quarter. But gold had rallied so hard for most of the year that the funds still finished with a 54.8% return for all of 2016.\n\nA Super Bowl Bust for Investors\n\nFor a rare time, the Super Bowl stock-market predictor didn\u2019t work last year.\n\nPrevious Coverage Super Bowl Stock Predictor Has a Streak Going (January 2016)\n\nAs tracked by veteran market analyst Robert H.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest surprise about retirement?\n\nI get that question a lot. I retired in September 2015 after 33 years with The Wall Street Journal, the final decade of which I spent editing, and writing for, Encore, the Journal\u2019s guide to retirement planning and living. As such, I didn\u2019t expect many, if any, surprises in my first year outside the office.\n\nSo much for expectations.\n\n\u2022 Expenses: The importance of drafting a retirement budget is a theme that pops up regularly in these pages. And I did just that. But my wife and I have been hit with a number of bills that we simply didn\u2019t anticipate.\n\nLike the emergency-room visit for my wife\u2019s knee, and the subsequent physical therapy (about $1,000). And the help that our granddaughter needed when she moved to a new town (another $1,000). And the two plumbing emergencies last spring ($700). The list goes on.\n\nMy advice: Build more wiggle room into your budget than you think will be necessary.\n\n\u2022 Pace: My wife retired from her job as a teacher several years before me. So when I finally joined her, we entered our new life at a gallop. In particular, we hit the road. We traveled to France, New York, Washington, Arizona, the Caribbean, Virginia, New England and the beach (several times), all in the first 12 months.\n\nIn retrospect, it was too much, too quickly. Yes, we\u2019ve had a wonderful time. But we need to do a better job of pacing ourselves\u2014physically and financially.\n\n\u2022 Work: My plan, upon entering retirement, was simple: I would take a year off, travel and spend more time volunteering. After that\u2026perhaps I would try writing\u2014and working\u2014again.\n\nBut, as you can see, I\u2019m already working. In fact, I started writing this column only about five months after leaving the office. Needless to say, a big surprise.\n\nOf course, this is something that varies with each individual. In my case, I recognized, fairly quickly, that I missed writing and sharing insights with readers.\n\nSo I\u2019m back at it, part time. I enjoy this. I keep my hand \u201cin the game,\u201d and still have a great deal of freedom. And I know it\u2019s good for my neurons.\n\n***\n\nIn response to a recent question about asset allocation in retirement, you didn\u2019t mention how pensions or Social Security fit in the mix. Can I treat these, effectively, as bonds in my portfolio? And if so, can I invest a greater proportion of my 401(k) in riskier investments, like stocks?\n\nIn theory, pensions and Social Security can be viewed as an \u201casset\u201d\u2014in particular, as part of the bond mix\u2014on your balance sheet. You can\u2019t see or touch such assets, but they clearly produce a predictable stream of income, much like the interest payments on bonds. In fact, we can calculate a lump-sum value for these income streams (using a \u201cpresent value\u201d calculator, several of which can be found online).\n\nFor instance, a new retiree who gets $1,342 a month from Social Security (the average monthly payout for all retired workers) has an \u201casset\u201d worth about $300,000, depending on life expectancy and other factors. If we include that figure in the bond portion of the retiree\u2019s savings\u2014and if the nest egg, as a result, is \u201cbond heavy\u201d\u2014that would argue (as the questions above indicate) for reallocating this portfolio and adding more stocks.\n\nBut again, all this is \u201cin theory.\u201d In the real world, counting pensions and Social Security as assets can lead to some scary outcomes.\n\nLet\u2019s take a married couple whose combined Social Security payouts have a lump-sum value of $400,000. And let\u2019s say this same pair has $800,000 in \u201creal\u201d assets (401(k)s and individual retirement accounts). If their preferred asset allocation as they enter retirement is 50% stocks and 50% bonds, the Social Security \u201casset\u201d will cover the bulk of the bond allocation\u2014and most (75%) of this couple\u2019s \u201creal\u201d assets will need to be invested in stocks.\n\nNeedless to say, a nasty bear market could seriously damage a retirement portfolio in which three-quarters of actual savings are sitting in equities.\n\nYour best bet: Think of pensions and Social Security simply as sources of income and not as assets. It might sound good to have an \u201cextra\u201d $300,000 or so of bonds in your nest egg. But that won\u2019t provide much comfort if your real investments are taking a beating.\n\n***\n\nI\u2019m confused about how my Social Security benefits are taxed. It looks like I could lose as much as 85% of my annual benefits to taxes. Is that correct?\n\nThat figure, 85%, is part of the math involving Social Security and taxes. But it doesn\u2019t mean that 85% of your benefits will go up in smoke. Some background:\n\nAbout 40% of beneficiaries pay taxes on their benefits, according to the Social Security Administration. Whether your benefits are subject to tax depends largely on whether you have additional income, say, from wages or a 401(k).\n\nTo be specific: If you file a joint federal tax return, and if you and your spouse have a combined income below $32,000, none of your Social Security benefits are taxable. If your combined income totals between $32,000 and $44,000, as much as 50% of your benefits are subject to taxes, and if your combined income exceeds $44,000, as much as 85% of your benefits are subject to taxes. (The thresholds are lower for people filing as individuals.)\n\nThe key phrase is \u201csubject to taxes.\u201d If you\u2019re a high earner, as much as 85% of your benefits will be included as taxable income when you calculate your total tax bill for the year. But you won\u2019t lose 85% of your benefits to taxes. For instance, a retiree in the 28% tax bracket could expect to see 85% of his benefits taxed at a rate of 28%.\n\n(Note: \u201cCombined income,\u201d also known as \u201cprovisional income,\u201d is defined as the sum of three items: your adjusted gross income, nontaxable interest, and one-half of your Social Security benefits.)\n\nIf you want an idea of how much of your benefits will, in fact, be subject to tax, check out Publication 915 from the Internal Revenue Service, \u201cSocial Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits.\u201d Page 4 has a work sheet that can take you through the math.\n\nThe larger point: Social Security and taxes get complicated quickly. Fortunately, there are strategies\u2014converting a portion of a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, and tapping different types of retirement accounts for income, among others\u2014that can ease the pain. This is an instance where a good financial planner and/or accountant can be a great help.\n\nMr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal, and co-author of \u201cThe Wall Street Journal Complete Retirement Guidebook.\u201d His column examines financial issues for those thinking about, planning and living their retirement.

Only one month, January, saw an inflow in the period through October.\n\nThe outflow might not seem to be much in dollar terms, but it amounts to more than a quarter of the total $44.3 billion of assets held in such funds a year ago.\n\nMore striking is that one fund accounted for more than half of the total outflow: WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity ETF (DXJ). Over the past year, it lost $6.7 billion from estimated redemptions, reducing its assets under management to about $7.2 billion from $14.9 billion. The fund tracks Japanese stocks but hedges the exchange-rate risk for investors.\n\nThis wholesale dumping of stocks seems to be at odds with how the Japanese market has behaved over that same period. While the Nikkei Stock Average dropped sharply from November 2015 to January 2016, it traded mostly in a sideways range before surging last month.\n\nThe devil, as always, is in the details. In this case, currency markets played a pivotal role in foreign investors\u2019 appetite for Japanese stocks\u2014and in the WisdomTree fund\u2019s disproportionately large redemptions.\n\n\u201cThis is basically accurate,\u201d says Jesper Koll, head of Japan for WisdomTree.\n\nA country with a depreciating currency tends to have a stronger stock market, in part because exports become cheaper to foreign buyers, making goods from local companies more competitive in the global market. \u201cThere is literally an inverse 1 to 1 correlation between earnings and the weakness of the yen,\u201d Mr. Koll says.\n\nThe yen was at a recent low point against the dollar in the summer of 2015 and then started to rally, really picking up steam in early December. That helped put in motion the exodus from Japanese stocks around that time, which more or less coincides with the start of the mutual-fund outflow.\n\nUnwinding a trade\n\nJay Kaufman, co-manager of BMO Disciplined International Equity Fund (BDAQX), says it is all part of an unwinding of a multiyear trade that dates back to 2012.\n\nThat is when Japanese Prime Minister Abe introduced the so-called Abenomics of very accommodative monetary policy, which resulted in a softening yen.\n\nFor investors, the trade was simple, says Mr. Kaufman. Buy Japanese stocks as long as the currency was falling, but also make sure that the investment was hedged.\n\nIf you look at assets under management in the WisdomTree ETF against the yen-dollar rate, there is an \u201calmost perfect correlation,\u201d says Mr. Kaufman. At the beginning of December 2012 the fund had $1.2 billion in assets, which grew to $14.9 billion three years later as the yen weakened. As the yen strengthened, the assets began falling.\n\nExpect gains ahead\n\nIn recent months, the yen has started to weaken against the U.S. currency again, and with that Japanese stocks have rallied. The Nikkei rose to more than 18500 recently from a low of 14952 on June 24.\n\nWisdomTree\u2019s Mr. Koll says now that the dollar is stronger again, investors are putting money back into the Japanese market.\n\n\u201cPeople are now more confident that yen will be weak, and the prospects are good for Japanese stocks,\u201d he says.\n\nGoldman Sachs said in a recent report that foreign investors \u201ccontinue to be net sellers\u201d of Japanese stocks. \u201cHowever, the amount of selling has declined markedly, suggesting foreign selling pressure is receding.\u201d\n\nThe report goes on to state that Japanese equity weightings in international stock funds \u201chave changed little, remaining about 6% underweight.\u201d That means fund investors hold a smaller portion of Japanese stocks than would be considered normal.\n\nThat could be considered a contrary indicator, meaning that lower-than-normal exposure to Japanese stocks is actually bullish, as investor money is on the sidelines.\n\nMr. Constable is a writer in New York.

Illustration: Gary Taxali for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMost people have a pretty good idea of how to handle inheriting a family member\u2019s heirlooms, cash or even real estate. But when stocks are inherited, it can get a little more complicated.\n\nBe they securities in a large public company or private equities in a small family firm, the heart of the issue with stocks is they mix the emotional with the financial, advisers say.\n\nSome may inherit shares in a deceased parent\u2019s longtime employer, for instance, and feel a sympathetic attachment that beclouds a sound financial decision. Others may have no idea how, when or where to sell the stocks, and what the tax implications of doing so may be.\n\nHere are four things financial advisers recommend for people feeling confused about a recent stock inheritance.\n\n1. First, do nothing\n\nSome who inherit stocks might feel the urge to act quickly. The market moves at a rapid pace, after all, so selling right away could be a natural impulse, especially for those who have never owned stocks before.\n\nBut fight this feeling, says Nick Holeman, a financial adviser for robo-advisory firm Betterment.\n\n\u201cIt can take some time for the estate to settle,\u201d Mr. Holeman says. \u201cand you have a lot of other things going on aside from the finances\u2014maybe a funeral, dealing with relatives and wills.\u201d\n\nThe early phase of an inheritance can be a financially vulnerable one, too. Mr. Holeman warns that while a sudden injection of assets is great for your financial situation, it is also an attractive moment for commission-based salespeople to pressure you into selling your stocks and buying financial products that don\u2019t have your needs as a central focus.\n\n\u201cIf a salesman or a so-called financial adviser seems to be hounding you to \u2018get on this really quickly,\u2019 be careful,\u201d he says.\n\n2. Then, figure out your tax liabilities\n\nAn important early step is to calculate what the potential tax liability of selling inherited stocks may be, advisers say. A common misconception: Some people fear that they will be taxed significantly on the appreciation of the asset over the lifetime of the benefactor.\n\nThis is incorrect. Federal capital-gains taxes take into account the growth of a stock\u2014one that is not in a retirement account\u2014only from the benefactor\u2019s date of death, not the date the benefactor purchased the stock, says Kathleen Campbell, founder of Campbell Financial Partners, a fee-only financial advisory in Fort Myers, Fla.\n\n\u2018A lot of times when you inherit money, unfortunately your parents or friends probably didn\u2019t have as well-organized a financial plan as I would recommend.\u2019 \u2014Financial adviser Nick Holeman\n\n\u201cThe person inheriting just needs to look up the high and low prices on the date of death, average those, and that is the basis,\u201d she says.\n\nSome investment companies may not automatically calculate this basis, which can result in an incorrect\u2014and possibly higher\u2014tax liability. Advisers recommend that a beneficiary check with the executor of the will to make sure the basis has been updated.\n\nEstates subject to the estate tax\u2014currently, those over $5.45 million\u2014have another option for calculating the cost basis. Instead of valuing the estate at the date of death, they may value it six months after, says Vic Hess, president of ButtonWood Advisors in Tucson, Ariz.\n\n\u201cIf the estate in total is less than it was at the date of death, you can use the alternate date,\u201d says Mr. Hess. \u201cBut you can\u2019t just pick a couple assets out of it. It\u2019s got to be the whole estate, both the ups and the downs.\u201d\n\n3. Make a plan to sell\n\nAfter calculating tax consequences, advisers say that in general, it will probably be a good idea for most people to sell stocks they have inherited.\n\n\u201cEspecially if you aren\u2019t a sophisticated investor and don\u2019t have individual stocks in your portfolio,\u201d says Christine Benz, director of personal finance at fund researchers Morningstar Inc.\n\nRelated Financial Advisers Try to Hold On to Business After Clients Die\n\nInheriting only one stock, as sometimes happens, or a portfolio of stocks dominated by shares of a single company, comes with the danger that holding on to that one particular stock can overexpose an investor to the fate of that company. Most investors need to diversify, which could mean buying into a product that involves a broad basket of securities, says Ms. Benz.\n\n4. Then, fit the money in with your larger goals\n\nA big mistake that beneficiaries make with stocks is selling them, and then failing to incorporate the cash into a larger set of financial goals.\n\nRegrettably, some will spend it all, says Mr. Holeman of Betterment. What inheritors of stock should do instead, he says, is ask themselves a set of questions, such as: \u201cWhat are your goals right now? Do you have an emergency fund? Do you have high-interest debt to pay off? Have you not maxed out your retirement contributions for this year?\u201d\n\nIt will probably be a good idea for most people to sell stocks they have inherited. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nAddressing these types of issues should be every inheritor\u2019s priority, Mr. Holeman says. If there are still individual stocks left after taking care of these needs, he says, then think about incorporating the stocks into a portfolio.\n\nThe thing to remember, he says, is that the inheritor\u2019s financial plan is likely very different from that of the person who left them the stocks.\n\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, a lot of times when you inherit money, unfortunately your parents or friends probably didn\u2019t have as well-organized a financial plan as I would recommend,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of times it\u2019s a smattering of random stocks and bonds that when you look at it cohesively, don\u2019t really match any sort of strategy.\u201d\n\nMr. Wells is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in London.

Photo: Walt Disney\n\nCollectors with a taste for nostalgia, and satire, are breathing new life into the market for animation art.\n\nSpecialist dealers and some auction houses report steadily rising prices in recent years for many of the drawings, storyboards, backgrounds and hand-painted bits of celluloid, known as \u201ccels,\u201d used to create classic cartoons and animated features from \u201cSnow White\u201d to \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver the past five years, we have seen a 20% increase every year\u201d in the number of buyers and the prices they are paying, says Mike Van Eaton, owner of Van Eaton Galleries in Sherman Oaks, Calif., which specializes in animation art. Some art from \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d a 1989 Disney release, has jumped to $2,000 from $500 just three years ago, says Mr. Van Eaton.\n\nMany thought demand for animation art had petered out after a boom in the 1980s. But new generations of collectors have stepped in. Most of today\u2019s collectors \u201cwant to buy back a piece of their childhood,\u201d Mr. Van Eaton adds.\n\nDesirable periods run the gamut from the 1920s, when animation shorts began, to the late 1990s, when studios producing animated films switched from hand-painted to digital images. Walt Disney Co. \u2019s Pixar Animation Studios, responsible for such hits as \u201cToy Story,\u201d was an early practitioner of digital animation. But while the occasional hand-drawn storyboard for a Pixar film will appear in collector circles, experts say they are rare and generally not for sale.\n\nArt from more recent animated films and TV programs is attracting millennials, says Jim Lentz, director of animation art sales at the Dallas-based Heritage Auctions. Millennials collect \u201cconcept\u201d drawings used for TV shows such as \u201cFamily Guy\u201d or hand-painted cels from early episodes of \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d Mr. Lentz says. Generation Xers, he says, prefer images from 1970s-era cartoons, such as \u201cSuper Friends\u201d or \u201cScooby-Doo.\u201d\n\nThere is plenty of material for buyers to choose from. A single minute of an early animated movie could involve as many as 1,200 individually painted images, first on paper or cardboard and then transferred onto sheets of celluloid that would be put under a camera. In addition, preliminary \u201cconcept\u201d drawings could be used to identify how a character in the movie would look. Storyboards would guide artists on the expected course of action. Paintings used as backgrounds are sold as well.\n\nGeneration Xers prefer images from 1970s-era cartoons, such as \u2018Super Friends\u2019 or \u2018Scooby-Doo,\u2019 says Jim Lentz of Heritage Auctions. Photo: Hanna-Barbera\n\nEarly Disney animated classics continue to be popular due in part to Disney\u2019s careful stewardship of the films. \u201cIt has been the practice of Disney to regularly bring back its classic movies to theaters every seven years,\u201d Mr. Van Eaton says of films such as \u201cSnow White,\u201d \u201cCinderella\u201d and \u201cThe Little Mermaid.\u201d And between releases, the films also are ubiquitously available thanks to DVDs, cable television, YouTube and Disney theme parks.\n\n\u201cThey are with us every day,\u201d says Mr. Van Eaton.\n\nRecent highlights from auctions of Disney animation art, according to Mr. Lentz, include $33,460 paid for a single cel from the 1955 classic \u201cLady and the Tramp,\u201d in which the two dogs share a spaghetti noodle (and end up meeting with their lips); also, $54,970 paid for a preliminary drawing from \u201cCinderella,\u201d a 1950 release, showing Cinderella and her coach.\n\nMillennials collect hand-painted \u2018cels\u2019 from early episodes of the TV show \u2018The Simpsons.\u2019 A cel from one of the opening title scenes sold at Heritage Auctions for $3,585. Photo: Fox/Heritage Auctions\n\nThe drawing for \u201cCinderella\u201d was by Mary Blair, a highly esteemed artist working for Disney at the time.\n\n\u201cFive years ago, I would have guessed that Mary Blair might have brought $5,000 to $6,000,\u201d Mr. Van Eaton adds.\n\nCollectors clamor for artwork from studios other than Disney as well. A painting of Bugs Bunny, the classic Warner Bros. character, by longtime Warner Bros. animator and director Chuck Jones, sold for $20,315 at Heritage Auctions in 2015, while a 1938 Paramount Picture poster for the Betty Boop animated film \u201cPudgy the Watchman\u201d sold at Bonhams for $3,125.\n\nIt is not just the artist, title or studio that determines whether a piece of animation art has value. Other keys are the popularity of the characters shown, and their poses. For instance, images of the lesser-known dogs in \u201cLady and the Tramp\u201d are not nearly as sought-after as images with the title characters.\n\nOther factors that can influence higher values:e who the previous owners were (ownership by the film\u2019s studio or the artist\u2019s family have greater cache than ownership by a private collector or fan), also whether the piece is signed, and by whom\u2014possibly the artist, director or voice actor.\n\nWalt Disney himself seemed to know there was a market for the production elements of his animated movies. Mr. Disney worked with the San Francisco-based Courvoisier Galleries back in the 1930s and \u201940s to market and sell cels. Those Courvoisier cels now frequently appear at auction.\n\nMr. Grant is a writer in Amherst, Mass. Email him at reports@wsj.com.", "date": null, "title": "Animation Art Draws Buyers"}

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nA popular tax break that died at the end of 2014 has returned from the dead.\n\nThat\u2019s welcome news for many older people thinking about making gifts to their favorite charities directly from their individual retirement accounts. It\u2019s joyous news for many charities, too.\n\nBut, as with too many of our nation\u2019s tax laws, this seemingly simple break can be tricky, as readers have pointed out with several excellent questions.\n\nAsk a Question Have a taxes-related question? Email taxquestions@wsj.com\n\nAt issue is a law that generally allows IRA owners who are 70\u00bd or older to transfer as much as $100,000 a year to qualified charities directly from their IRAs, tax-free. That transfer is excluded from your income. If done properly, the transfer counts toward an IRA owner\u2019s required minimum distribution for the year.\n\nAlthough this provision expired at the end of 2014, Congress resurrected it late last year, making it retroactive to the start of 2015\u2014and making it permanent, says Greg Rosica, a tax partner at Ernst & Young LLP.\n\nIf you are thinking of taking advantage of this provision, make sure you understand the fine print. For example, you have to transfer assets directly from the IRA to qualified charities to qualify.\n\nAmong those keenly interested in this subject is my friend Steve Treadgold, a lawyer who lives in La Jolla, Calif. Steve raises an interesting question about the age limit.\n\nSteve recently turned 70. He wants to make a donation now directly from his IRA to charity because it would qualify for a generous matching contribution from another organization. Steve will be 70\u00bd in August. If he waits until then, the matching offer won\u2019t be available.\n\nSteve asks: Can he make the transfer from his IRA now and qualify for this tax provision since this is the year in which he will turn 70\u00bd? Or does he have to wait to make the transfer at least until the day in August when he actually reaches the official milestone of 70\u00bd?\n\nAnswer: \u201cYou cannot take advantage of this special provision until you reach age 70\u00bd,\u201d says Martin Hall, a partner in the Boston office of Ropes & Gray LLP and head of the law firm\u2019s private client group. \u201cYour reader will have to wait until August.\u201d\n\nAn IRS publication confirms this point. It says you must be least 70\u00bd \u201cwhen the distribution was made.\u201d\n\nHere are answers to other questions about this provision, known in some tax circles as \u201cqualified charitable distributions,\u201d or QCDs.\n\nQ: Can I make a transfer from my IRA to my donor-advised fund and qualify for this break?\n\nA: No. Donor-advised funds, such as those offered by Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group, Charles Schwab and other financial institutions, don\u2019t count as qualified charities under this provision, says Mr. Rosica of Ernst & Young.\n\nQ: What about other types of retirement plans? For example, can you make a qualified charitable transfer from a 401 (k) plan?\n\nA: No, says Mr. Hall of Ropes & Gray. This provision doesn\u2019t apply to \u201cdistributions from Keoghs, 403(b) plans, 401(k) plans, profit-sharing plans and the like,\u201d he says.\n\nAlso, distributions from employer-sponsored retirement plans such as Simple IRAs and Simplified Employee Pension Plans \u201cdon't qualify,\u201d Mr. Hall says.\n\nQ: Is the maximum exclusion amount really $100,000 a year, or is it $100,000 over my lifetime?\n\nA: That $100,000 amount is the maximum annual amount, says Mr. Rosica of Ernst & Young. It isn\u2019t a once-in-a-lifetime offer.\n\nQ: How does it work for married couples? Is the limit $100,000, or double that amount?\n\nA: You and your spouse each can exclude up to $100,000. That amount is the maximum per person, not the maximum for married couples. \u201cHowever, each spouse must have his or her own account, and each spouse cannot make a qualified charitable distribution for more than $100,000,\u201d Mr. Hall says.\n\nQ: If I take advantage of this provision, can I deduct my transfer as a charitable donation?\n\nA: No. These charitable transfers are tax-free but not tax deductible.\n\nQ: So if you can\u2019t deduct these transfers as charitable gifts, why is this law so popular?\n\nA: Many donors prize this provision because the transfer won\u2019t inflate their income, thus helping them in several ways.\n\nMany tax deductions, credits, phase-outs and other numbers are tied to \u201cadjusted gross income\u201d or certain other measures of income. Thus, by excluding qualified charitable transfers from income, this provision helps many people save money. For example, it may spare them from owing higher taxes on Social Security benefits and from having to pay higher Medicare premiums, as my colleague Laura Saunders pointed out in a column in The Wall Street Journal late last year.\n\nIf these direct IRA charitable transfers weren\u2019t excluded from income, taxpayers could get hit in other ways. Higher adjusted gross income \u201cmight make one more likely to be subject to the tax on net investment income,\u201d says Mark Luscombe, principal analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting. \u201cIt might increase the amount of the phaseout for many other deductions and credits. By keeping adjusted gross income lower by doing a direct IRA distribution to a charity, a taxpayer may increase the benefit of these other breaks.\u201d\n\nMoreover, some donors can\u2019t deduct their charitable donations anyway because they take the standard deduction, instead of itemizing. About two-thirds of all returns each year claim the standard deduction.\n\n***\n\nSome long-term procrastinators may be paying a hefty price for their inaction\u2014or, perhaps, because of an understandable misunderstanding.\n\nHere is the problem: The IRS recently announced that an estimated one million taxpayers are in danger of losing federal income-tax refunds soon because they haven\u2019t filed their tax return for 2012. Those refunds total about $950 million. About half of the refunds are worth more than $718 apiece, the IRS said.\n\nTaxpayers might assume there shouldn\u2019t be a deadline to file a return, as long as they are entitled to a refund. That\u2019s wrong, the IRS says. To collect, those people must file a return for 2012 \u201cno later than this year\u2019s April tax deadline.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t blame the IRS. Blame Congress. The law gives most people who haven\u2019t filed a return \u201ca three-year window of opportunity\u201c to claim a refund, the IRS said. If you haven\u2019t filed by the deadline, the money goes to the U.S. Treasury. For returns that were due for 2012, \u201cthe window closes\u201d on this year\u2019s April tax-filing deadline\u2014which is Monday, April 18, 2016 for most of the country.\n\nSome low-income taxpayers may be missing out on a valuable opportunity. \u201cWe especially encourage students and others who didn\u2019t earn much money (during 2012) to look into this situation because they may still be entitled to a refund,\u201d says IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.\n\nFor example, some people who didn\u2019t file \u201cstand to lose more than just their refund of taxes withheld or paid during 2012,\u201d the IRS points out \u201cMany low-and-moderate income workers may not have claimed the earned-income tax credit,\u201d which is designed to help the working poor.\n\nMr. Herman is a writer in New York City.

And what would you most regret if you died tomorrow?\n\nThe goal: \u201cTo lead people to a deeper and deeper understanding of what\u2019s most important to them,\u201d says Mr. Kinder.\n\nThe site pushes users to come up with concrete goals they can achieve within weeks. For example, someone who dreams of moving to Vermont might pledge to research towns and discuss telecommuting with an employer, says Mr. Kinder.\n\nAn alternative: LifeReimagined.org, an AARP website that offers free online tutorials on topics including setting goals and career planning. Developed by experts including author and executive coach Richard Leider, the program includes free 90-minute \u201ccheckups\u201d for as many as 25 participants in locations nationwide. AARP is developing longer workshops and in 2015 plans to offer one-on-one online sessions with coaches for about $125 an hour.\n\nLongevity Forecasting\n\nPeople often underestimate how long they are going to live, which can cause them to overestimate how much they can spend each year in retirement. For many, the mistake lies in overlooking advances in health care that improve their odds of living longer than their parents did.\n\nFor an estimate that incorporates health, habits, socioeconomic status and family history, there are life-expectancy calculators such as livingto100.com and How Long Will I Live? The latter was developed by professors at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nOur favorite is from Blue Zones, a company that studies regions with exceptional longevity and advises companies and communities on ways to improve the health of their employees and inhabitants. (Search for \u201cVitality Compass\u201d in the \u201cLive-Longer\u201d section at Bluezones.com.) In addition to life expectancy, the calculator can forecast healthy-life expectancy, defined as the age someone will reach before being diagnosed with heart disease, diabetes or cancer. As a result, it can provide insight into the number of years a person might pay higher health-care or long-term-care expenses. It also offers tips for living longer.\n\nDeveloped with the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, the calculator is powered by an algorithm that takes into account 29 factors that 314 academic studies have linked to life expectancy, says Nick Buettner, Blue Zones\u2019 community and corporate program director.\n\nHow Much to Save\n\nEven with a realistic estimate of life expectancy, it\u2019s virtually impossible to figure out how much to save for retirement or how long a nest egg might last without first knowing how much you\u2019re spending and on what.\n\nSeveral programs, including Mint and Yodlee\u2019s MoneyCenter, can put together a budget for consumers based on their past spending patterns and alert them when they are in danger of exceeding past thresholds.\n\nThe services automatically import data from credit cards, loans, and bank, brokerage and 401(k) accounts. If a customer puts all of his or her purchases on credit and debit cards, the services can break down the spending into categories, such as utilities and groceries, and can even track amounts of spending at specific stores or on specific items.\n\nA growing number of these sites also function as retirement calculators. Mint can project people\u2019s retirement income based on what they have saved and what it figures they will save, given their habits. The service is free but earns a referral fee when users buy products and services, such as bank accounts and credit cards, from advertisers. Starting later this year, rival HelloWallet plans to offer the same basic service\u2014and allow users to model what will happen if they work longer or put more into a traditional or Roth 401(k) or individual retirement account or a health-savings account. The service is available free through some employers, or for $100 a year.\n\nMany services also try to help consumers save more money. HelloWallet computes a financial wellness score for each user, offers a comparison with scores of peers, and recommends ways to improve the score.\n\nRetirement Income Planning\n\nWhen planning retirement, saving money is half the battle. The other half: figuring out how to generate a steady paycheck throughout retirement.\n\nA growing number of online tools can help. They include robust financial-planning software programs available from companies including Fidelity Investments and Morningstar Inc. that recommend what to invest in and withdrawal strategies. (Morningstar\u2019s service, Retirement Manager, is available through some employer-sponsored defined-contribution plans.)\n\nBecause each has pros and cons and is programmed with different assumptions, it\u2019s ideal to try more than one, says Anna Rappaport, chairperson of the Society of Actuaries committee on postretirement needs and risks.\n\nSome recommend a specific approach to investing. For example, Fidelity\u2019s Income Strategy Evaluator, available free, often recommends annuities for those unable to cover basic living expenses with guaranteed sources of retirement income, including Social Security and a pension. (Fidelity sells its own annuities, as well as offerings from companies including MetLife Inc. and New York Life Insurance Co.)\n\nOur favorite income-planning tools\u2014ESPlanner from Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff, and Retiree Income from Baylor University Prof. William Reichenstein and co-founder Bill Meyer\u2014combine income and tax planning, an area that not all such tools address.\n\nThese services aren\u2019t free. Three phone sessions with a Retiree Income adviser cost from $500 to $2,500. (The greater your assets, the higher the fee.) Retiree Income plans to introduce a do-it-yourself version on its website starting at about $20 a month in early 2015. ESPlanner starts at $149 for the first year plus $50-a-year updates. It offers guidance from an adviser on the phone for $150 an hour. For $500, an adviser will run the program.\n\n\u201cOur research has shown that an optimal Social Security strategy, combined with tax-efficient withdrawals, can extend the life of a portfolio by as much as 10 years or longer,\u201d says Prof. Reichenstein. One caveat: The recommendations sometimes call for deferring Social Security to maximize those benefits and reap tax savings.\n\nSocial Security Planning\n\nNot everyone depends on Social Security benefits to cover essential living expenses, but no one should pass up the opportunity to maximize those benefits if they can. The tricky part is knowing when is the best time for each individual to start collecting. A growing number of online programs aim to help users peg the optimal claiming strategy.\n\nFor couples, the claiming decision can be especially complicated because of the availability of spousal benefits and the need to consider the financial security of the survivor. Because benefits will rise by 6% to 8% for every year you delay claiming between the ages of 62 and 70, those who claim early may reduce the lifetime benefits they (and their surviving spouses) stand to receive by \u201ctens of thousands of dollars,\u201d says Christopher Jones, chief investment officer at Financial Engines Inc., which offers a free calculator.\n\nOur top pick? SocialSecuritySolutions.com, which charges from $20 to $250 (depending on the level of advice). This user-friendly site takes into account a wide variety of household configurations as well as the impact that many other sources of retirement income can have on Social Security benefits.\n\nMedical Care\n\nFrom quick consultations to second opinions, more Web-based companies offer virtual medical visits via text messages, email, phone and video.\n\nMost services, including Teladoc and MDLive, are mainly for routine conditions, such as rashes, sports injuries and the flu. At Doctor on Demand Inc., patients who answer questions about their medical histories are typically connected with a primary-care doctor within two minutes, says Chief Executive Adam Jackson. The site\u2019s 1,400 physicians can write prescriptions. The cost, which some insurers will cover, is $40 per visit.\n\nFor more serious conditions, Grand Rounds Inc. offers second opinions. The site has contracts with more than 1,000 specialists affiliated with facilities including Harvard Medical School. Mainly offered by employers, it is free to those who get it as an employee benefit. Otherwise, it costs $7,500 per medical case\u2014and insurance generally doesn\u2019t pick up the tab. That means if a patient contracts with the service in connection with a hip replacement, and gets cancer the next day, he or she would have to pay another $7,500 for help with that condition.\n\nThe service is intended \u201cfor complex cases where outcomes are going to be dramatically different based on expertise,\u201d says Owen Tripp, chief executive of Grand Rounds. The service can give referrals to local doctors and book appointments. Aside from providing second opinions, the specialists help plan care and answer follow-up questions, he says.\n\nCaregiving\n\nWorried about mom or dad\u2019s spending? New Web tools can give caregivers almost real-time oversight.\n\nOne free app, BillGuard, sends a person\u2019s debit- and credit-card charges to a mobile inbox, where that person\u2014or a designated caregiver\u2014can monitor the transactions. There is typically a one-day lag between the transactions and the time when they appear in the inbox.\n\nA caregiver keeping close tabs can use that information to cancel transactions or request refunds, says Yaron Samid, founder and chief executive. BillGuard also sends alerts about purchases from specific merchants that its algorithms and one million users have identified as scams.\n\nFor more control, True Link Financial Inc. offers a service with a prepaid debit card for $10 a month through which caregivers can monitor charges and block spending at specific merchants or charities, or on whole categories\u2014sweepstakes, for example.\n\nEstate Planning\n\nA handful of sites offer a blueprint for estate planning, including a list of the documents that are generally needed in addition to a will.\n\nOne of the most comprehensive, Everplans.com, explains how to complete documents such as health-care proxies and powers of attorney that appoint people to make medical and financial decisions on behalf of someone who becomes incapacitated. It has links to standard versions of these documents for all 50 states plus the District of Columbia and discusses living wills, do-not-resuscitate orders and some types of trusts. The site also sends emails to urge users to take specific steps, such as uploading or completing documents.\n\nFor $75 a year, users receive five gigabytes of storage for documents on the site. Users frequently upload copies of items their beneficiaries will need, including insurance policies, Social Security cards, bank account numbers, online usernames and passwords, and contracts with funeral homes and cemeteries. Some users even include explanations of their wills, says Abby Schneiderman, the site\u2019s co-founder.\n\nThe site requires users to name deputies to receive access to the information. It also recommends companies that provide wills and life insurance, although it currently receives no payment from those companies, says Ms. Schneiderman. Similar websites include Principled Heart.\n\nEnd-of-Life Care\n\nMaking decisions in advance about what health care to receive at life\u2019s end can be difficult. But people who don\u2019t address the issue can leave loved ones guessing at critical times.\n\nMoreover, \u201cwhen these discussions take place in a crisis, conflict can emerge, including sibling rivalry,\u201d says Harriet Warshaw, executive director of the nonprofit Conversation Project, one of a handful of initiatives dedicated to making it easier to talk about the topic.\n\nCo-founded in 2010 by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ellen Goodman, the Conversation Project offers a free \u201cConversation Starter Kit\u201d that poses questions including: How much information do you want your doctor to share with your family? And are there important milestones you want to reach? There\u2019s also advice on talking with doctors about these issues.\n\nWhile 90% of Americans say it\u2019s important to discuss end-of-life medical care, only 27% actually have the talk, says Ms. Warshaw. \u201cNobody wants to have these conversations, which is why people do not have more control over the way they live at the end of their lives. \u201cWe want to give people the courage and confidence to broach the subject.\u201d\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nSick of earning next to nothing in interest? Once a month, MaxMyInterest.com will automatically sweep cash from a checking account at one of five brick-and-mortar banks into one or more FDIC-insured savings accounts at online banks with above-average interest rates. Currently, those banks pay between 0.75% and 1.05%, versus the 0.09% national average for money-market and savings accounts. Max\u2019s annual fee: 0.08% of total assets in the online bank accounts. The brick-and-mortar banks are Bank of America Corp., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc.\u2019s Citibank, Wells Fargo & Co. and First Republic Bank.\n\nAnother good way to save more is to pay less in fees. According to Vanguard Group, over a 40-year career, someone who invests 9% a year of a salary that starts at $30,000 into a balanced fund and pays 0.25% a year in fees will save 20% more than a person who pays 1.25% in fees. FeeX.com can help. The free site shows how much in dollars a user is paying in fees each month, and projects the cumulative lifetime cost of those fees. It identifies fees paid to financial advisers, brokerage firms, 401(k) plans, and mutual funds, and suggests similar, but lower-cost, funds.\n\nFor 401(k) advice, check out blooom.com (with three O\u2019s). For $1 to $15 a month, blooom.com\u2019s algorithm picks what funds to invest in from a customer\u2019s 401(k) plan menu\u2014and makes the trades for them. And every three months, the service rebalances the portfolio to a target mix of stocks and bonds that becomes more conservative over time, says CEO Chris Costello. One caveat: With a recommended 80% allocation to stocks for someone 10 years from retirement, the service is for those comfortable with equities.\n\nMs. Tergesen is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-guide-to-not-retiring-1426475064", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Illustration: C.J. Burton\n\nIt\u2019s an inescapable reality of getting older: At some point, everybody expects you to retire.\n\nThere\u2019s your spouse, who perhaps is already retired and is looking forward to enjoying a relaxing life with you\u2014traveling, visiting grandchildren and just enjoying each other\u2019s company. Then there are your co-workers, who may already be whispering about who gets your office. And, let\u2019s face it, the rest of society also figures you\u2019re ready to retire, because giving up work is simply what most people do.\n\nContinuing to work in later life is a tough decision, but it might be the right thing. How do you decide whether to stay? Financial advisor Patricia Smith discusses. Photo: Getty\n\nBut what if you don\u2019t want to? What if you could afford to retire, but prefer to keep working because you love it? To turn the old saying on its head: What if you find yourself on your deathbed and really do wish you had spent more time at the office?\n\nStill, deciding to stay at work isn\u2019t easy\u2014either at home or at work. It means bucking a lot of people\u2019s expectations. It means possibly sparking resentment and misunderstanding. And it often means taking a hard look at your own abilities and actions, to make sure you are equipped to maintain the standards you had set for yourself in a very different era.\n\nA great number of older Americans are wrestling with these issues. Average retirement ages are climbing, and nearly half of baby boomers say they expect to work until age 66 or beyond, according to Gallup Inc. polls. Driving the trend, economists say, are highly educated workers in professional-services jobs who are sticking around by choice, rather than due to economic distress.\n\n\u201cLife expectancy is a good 25 years longer than it was a century ago,\u201d says Jackie Peterson, age 71, a consultant who also advises entrepreneurs at a small-business development center in Portland, Ore., and has no plans to retire. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m healthy and having fun, why not continue to work at something I love and get paid for it?\u201d\n\nWhat follows is a guide to help those approaching traditional retirement age determine whether staying in their current job or career path is right for them\u2014and, if so, how to navigate the process at work and at home.\n\nShould I keep punching the clock?\n\nFor people coming up on retirement age, the most basic question is figuring out whether it\u2019s time to go or stay. And that requires some serious soul searching.\n\n\u201cAs we age, time is the economic variable that gets scarce,\u201d says Bill Winn, a psychologist with career-development firm New Directions Inc. in Boston. \u201cPeople really need to think about how they want to spend that time and whether they want to work as hard or in the same way anymore.\u201d\n\nPatricia Smith, a managing director at New Directions, says it\u2019s important to \u201cbe self-aware and tuned in to where you are now, versus five or 10 years ago,\u201d and to look at your life plan, including your values, family situation and interests. Another gauge of whether sticking around is a good idea is your willingness to take on new projects and stay current, including with technology.\n\n\u201cTaking on a new project, raising your hand, particularly if it gives you new skills to stay current,\u201d is a sign of passion, Ms. Smith says.\n\nLast year, Randall Martin was feeling restless and thinking of retiring. The 56-year-old industrial designer, who had spent 25 years at Hewlett-Packard Co., knew he could afford to stop working, but he didn\u2019t know if he wanted to. So he asked himself a series of \u201chard questions,\u201d starting with, \u201cWhat would I do if I didn\u2019t have to go to work today?\u201d The Houston resident, who loves to hike, cycle, fly-fish and camp, had no shortage of possible answers.\n\nBalanced against that was his love of work. Even on weekends, he takes on design projects for fun. \u201cI used to remodel the bathrooms in my free time,\u201d he says. \u201cI was the kid who was always modifying my bicycle and building forts. I\u2019ve never really seen my job as a job.\u201d\n\nIndeed, when he envisioned retirement, \u201cI almost always concluded I would be working with some of my design friends on a consulting project for a computer company.\u201d\n\nWhile he was going through this process, a headhunter called him to ask him if he knew of anyone who might be interested in a job at Intel Corp., developing products that use the latest Intel chips. It sounded like the kind of challenge Mr. Martin was looking for, so he ended up taking the job himself. \u201cDeveloping these innovations is the thing that gets me up in the morning,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mr. Martin and his wife like the outdoorsy lifestyle in Oregon better than Houston. So, when his wife wraps up business in Houston, the two plan to settle in the Portland area, where they can be near the mountains and the ocean.\n\nOthers who have chosen not to retire say they frequently ask themselves two questions: Am I happy? And am I having the impact I want to have?\n\nMark Shepard, senior consultant at New Directions, says it\u2019s important to delve into what you find most fun and satisfying about your work\u2014and make sure the job is delivering enough exposure to those things both now and in the future.\n\nFor some, sticking around for the culture and social opportunities may be enough, says Dr. Shepard. \u201cIf the culture and community you are in are nourishing you, then maybe that\u2019s a strong enough reason to stay.\u201d\n\nJan Abushakrah, 69, typically works 60-hour weeks as the chairwoman of the gerontology department at Portland Community College in Oregon. But retirement, she says, isn\u2019t on her agenda.\n\n\u201cI have pretty much purged the word from my vocabulary,\u201d she says. \u201cAs long as I am healthy and happy every morning when I wake up and have something exciting on my plate to look forward to, it is easy to say I could keep doing this forever.\u201d\n\nDr. Abushakrah\u2019s responsibilities include planning the curriculum and teaching and advising students, many of whom arrive on campus \u201cwith low self-esteem, low expectations and looking for direction,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly remove myself and disengage from all of these exciting things.\u201d\n\nIf anything might influence her to quit, Dr. Abushakrah adds, it would be signs of fading support for her initiatives from college administrators. \u201cIf I get to a point where I am feeling I am getting no support\u2014where there isn\u2019t enough of a payoff for the energy I put in or if I feel I am being undermined or my students\u2019 well-being is being compromised\u2014then I would rethink what I am doing. But I do not feel that way at all.\u201d\n\nHow do I approach my spouse?\n\nOnce people make the decision to keep working, they should compare notes with their spouse. Remaining on the job may make all the sense in the world\u2014to you. But it\u2019s important to sort out tough topics including money, age differences, job satisfaction and hopes for the future.\n\n\u201cMany couples operate on parallel tracks while raising kids and working,\u201d says Dr. Winn of New Directions. \u201cNow they need to figure out how to make a new intersection or a different collaboration work.\u201d\n\nPsychologist and author Dorian Mintzer says it\u2019s important not to \u201cpresent your spouse with a fait accompli.\u201d Sure, there\u2019s a chance your partner will welcome your decision to keep working. But there\u2019s also a chance he or she will be disappointed that you won\u2019t be available to travel or see the grandchildren, or incensed that you \u201cmade a momentous decision and didn\u2019t bother to consult with him or her.\u201d\n\nDr. Mintzer recommends that both spouses create an \u201cindividual vision of what each wants to achieve in the next part of life,\u201d and then compare notes. \u201cReally listen and appreciate what the other would like to do,\u201d she says. In the event you have to \u201cagree to disagree,\u201d such an approach \u201ccreates more empathy and understanding.\u201d\n\nIf your spouse feels disappointment at your decision, she recommends finding a way to \u201cnegotiate working a little less,\u201d if only by working from home one day a week and devoting the time saved on commuting to doing something together. The key is to \u201cbegin taking each other\u2019s needs into account, to hear what\u2019s important to each other\u201d and to come up with a plan to keep talking, if not to compromise.\n\nMs. Peterson, the entrepreneurship coach, says she and her husband, Bob, have had their differences over her desire not to retire. Shortly after the two married in 2001, Mr. Peterson retired from his job as a financial counselor for the state of Oregon\u2019s Public Employees Retirement System. Ms. Peterson, in contrast, says she can\u2019t foresee a time when she will ever want to stop working.\n\n\u201cI love what I do. He liked what he did. That\u2019s a big difference,\u201d she says.\n\nMs. Peterson says her husband has made it clear that he would prefer that she retire, too. \u201cHe\u2019d really like to do more things on a casual, spontaneous basis, like go for a walk on a sunny afternoon,\u201d she says. \u201cBut my calendar is booked.\u201d\n\nAt some point, she adds, her husband gave up asking her to retire, and instead asked her to \u201cbe more available.\u201d (Mr. Peterson declined to comment.) In response, Ms. Peterson recently hired an assistant to handle some of the administrative responsibilities in her consulting business. She also strives to \u201cstick to a predictable schedule.\u201d And, thanks to the flexibility of the small-business development center where she also works, she takes summers off.\n\nIn contrast, Roberta Taylor, 71, a retirement and money coach and speaker who lives in Waltham, Mass., says scaling back isn\u2019t an option. The co-author with Dr. Mintzer of \u201cThe Couple\u2019s Retirement Puzzle: 10 Must-Have Conversations for Creating an Amazing New Life Together,\u201d she is writing a new book and rebranding her coaching business.\n\nWork is \u201calways on my mind,\u201d says Ms. Taylor. \u201cWhen you are self-employed, you have to be the one to think about how to grow the business.\u201d\n\nMs. Taylor says she has always made it clear to her husband, Bruce Narasin, 73, that work is \u201ca part of who I am\u201d and that she has \u201cno intention of retiring.\u201d\n\nBut she is also careful to carve out time with Mr. Narasin, who retired last spring after a career at companies including International Business Machines Corp. and Intuit Inc. The pair spends two days a week caring for their 2-year-old granddaughter and has regular date nights, as well as evenings out with friends.\n\nMr. Narasin says \u201cthere are times when it would be nice if we had a little more time together.\u201d But, he adds, \u201cwe have good quality time. How could I say, \u2018I want you to stop doing what you love doing so you can spend more time sitting around and looking at me?\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Narasin says he makes an effort to keep busy. He joined a men\u2019s group, teaches computer courses at a local senior center and performs many household duties. Ms. Taylor\u2014who says she sometimes worries that her husband \u201cfeels abandoned\u201d\u2014tries to cook \u201cas much as I can. I feel like that\u2019s a loving, nurturing thing to do.\u201d\n\nHow do I handle things at work?\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the question of how you should change your approach to the office once you get close to what is typically regarded as retirement age. For a start, how should you communicate your decision to your colleagues and clients?\n\nYour instinct may be to remain silent\u2014and let your hard work speak for itself. But thanks to age-related stereotypes, career counselors say, it\u2019s important to position yourself so that no one will look at you as likely to bow out soon.\n\n\u201cWe have a societal expectation of what people do at certain times of life,\u201d says Helen Dennis, a Redondo Beach, Calif., specialist on retirement and careers. \u201cWhen you are in your mid-60s and above, unless you state otherwise, the assumption is that you will be retiring soon.\u201d\n\nConsider Margaret Neal. At 62, the director of the Institute on Aging at Portland State University says she has no intention of retiring anytime soon. \u201cI am at a point in my life and career where I am loving what I am doing,\u201d she says.\n\nProf. Neal often works long hours\u2014from morning to midnight\u2014juggling projects that include the city of Portland\u2019s involvement in the World Health Organization\u2019s Global Network of Age-Friendly Cities and Communities, which started with a study she and her colleagues conducted in 2006. Her work, she adds, is \u201chaving an impact,\u201d such as increased interest in developing accessible housing.\n\nAs a result, Prof. Neal says, she was surprised when a colleague recently asked her about her retirement plans. \u201cPeople\u2019s assumptions that I might be thinking about retirement are coming much earlier than I expected.\u201d\n\nCareer counselors say some people encounter consequences that can be far more serious.\n\nFor example, they say, if colleagues assume you will be leaving before you intend to go, they may treat you as a lame duck. In a worst-case scenario, they may cut you out of projects, look to others for guidance, and not offer you the best assignments or long-term ones. Some may even start angling for your job.\n\nAs a result, career counselors advise older workers to take steps to signal a long-term commitment and a youthful mind-set. Tactics include taking on lengthy projects, keeping technology skills up-to-date and cultivating \u201clike-minded friends of all ages,\u201d says Ms. Dennis, who recently found a \u201creciprocal mentor,\u201d the CEO of a startup company, to help her enhance her social-networking skills.\n\nMs. Smith of New Directions says it\u2019s also important to disclose your desire to stick around in both informal conversations and an annual performance review. In the review, she adds, you should also take the chance to \u201carticulate your value.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe marketplace has changed its attitude toward workers age 50 and over,\u201d Ms. Smith says. \u201cOlder professionals have amassed so much skill and experience. Their accumulated know-how can be essential to the success of an organization.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also important to figure out how to maintain passion, says Dr. Shepard of New Directions. When people see \u201cthe same problem coming around the corner, no matter how complex it is, if they have done it and solved it 15 times, the thrill is gone.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a sentiment Edwin Harnden can relate to. \u201cPassion and excitement for what you do doesn\u2019t just drop like manna from heaven,\u201d says the 68-year-old managing partner at Portland law firm Barran Liebman LLP. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that take work.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Mr. Harnden engages in goal-setting exercises, both alone and in monthly meetings with colleagues, who \u201cchallenge one another to make use of our skills, stay engaged and give back\u201d to the community with pro bono work.\n\nLike others, Mr. Harnden has also gravitated toward playing new roles, including mentoring younger colleagues.\n\n\u201cIt helps keep me pumped up,\u201d he says. His mantra: \u201cAm I pushing my boundaries?\u201d\n\nMs. Tergesen is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Photo: Getty\n\nThe first person to live to 150 is alive today.\n\nFor many months I drove home past a financial-services billboard advertising this dramatic claim, followed by the punch line: \u201cLet\u2019s get ready for a longer retirement.\u201d\n\nThe focus of that message, of course, is money\u2014the size of our nest eggs. But the words highlight a far bigger challenge. In the early decades of the 21st century, we are pushing, rapidly, to extend our lives. But we\u2019re paying scant attention to how we should make the most of that additional time.\n\nWhere are the innovations designed to make these bonus decades actually worth living? Aside from the mind-boggling prospect of saving for 50- or 75-year retirements, how do we make these new chapters both fulfilling for individuals and sustainable for society?\n\nLife extension without social innovation is a recipe for dystopian disaster\u2014what one critic characterizes as \u201cthe coming death shortage,\u201d invoking images not only of endless (and unaffordable) retirements but of a society loaded down by a population explosion of the idle old.\n\nAs thousands of baby boomers each day surge into their 60s and 70s, it\u2019s time to focus on enriching lives, not just lengthening them; on providing purpose and productivity, not just perpetuity.\n\nWe need to marshal imagination and ingenuity to devise new strategies for enhancing the whole range of experiences in later life, including education, faith, housing, work, finance and community.\n\nIllustration: Robert Neubecker for The Wall Street Journal\n\nHere are six ideas to launch us on that path.\n\nCome up with a new name for this new chapter of life.\n\nNaming a phase of life\u2014giving it a coherent identity\u2014does more than most people realize to make life, and society, work better. It creates a framework for constructing the pathways, products and policies required to make the most of this period. And so it should be with the new chapter taking shape between, roughly, ages 55 and 75.\n\nConsider: One hundred years ago, we worried about a profusion of young people who were neither children nor adults. In 1904, G. Stanley Hall, the great American psychologist, helped put \u201cadolescence\u201d on the map with his seminal book of that name. Here, then, was a framework around which educators, legislators and entrepreneurs could begin developing new arrangements to make the most of that period.\n\nToday, of course, we take \u201cadolescence\u201d for granted. But the invention of that stage of life acted as a stimulus for, among other breakthroughs, making high-school education widespread and expanding child-labor laws. (Although it did take several decades after Hall\u2019s treatise for the \u201cteenage\u201d label to become ubiquitous.)\n\nLet\u2019s realize the same benefits for the new phase taking shape after midlife, starting with the nomenclature. What should we call this emerging period between our middle years and old age? Observers have suggested the \u201cthird chapter,\u201d \u201cadulthood II,\u201d even \u201cmiddlescence.\u201d (Interestingly, G. Stanley Hall was among the first to suggest a new stage between our middle years and old age, describing it, poetically, as an Indian summer.)\n\nMake the transition as easy as possible.\n\nRemember the old rites of passage\u2014the retirement party, the gold watch, the RV trip? As we create a new life chapter beyond midlife, we need to afford people the time and space to move to what\u2019s next.\n\nIt\u2019s common for young people to have four years of college to navigate the developmental passage from youth to adulthood, and now increasingly we are throwing in gap years before or after. But what about their parents? They\u2019ve been laboring long hours and juggling the responsibilities of family, and are now heading into a stage of life that doesn\u2019t have a name, much less a clear road map. There should be a gap year\u2014or at least a few bridge months\u2014for grown-ups to take a breather and figure out their next steps.\n\nMore individuals at this juncture seem to agree. Research from RAND Corp. reveals that a significant segment of the population is already retiring for a year or two, with every intention of returning to work following that respite. In other words, they are using the rubric of retirement to grant themselves a much-needed sabbatical\u2014to take some time to rest up before readying for what comes next.\n\nStill, theirs remains essentially a do-it-yourself process. It\u2019s time to help make this post-midlife passage more efficient and suited to preparing individuals emotionally and spiritually for what lies ahead.\n\nSome promising approaches are starting to emerge. Last fall, Rabbi Laura Geller of Los Angeles brought together a group of area congregations to think about what these new rites of passage might look like in the context of Judaism\u2014observing that her religion\u2019s life markers derive largely from biblical times, when lives were far shorter than today.\n\nOne answer: a kind of bar mitzvah for those moving into a new identity beyond midlife but far from the end of life, aimed at helping individuals reset their priorities and develop the right frame of mind for navigating their next phase, with particular focus on questions of leaving a legacy and how they might engage in \u201ctikkun olam,\u201d healing the world.\n\nAnother faith-infused effort is the Halftime Institute, which blends precepts of Christian faith with ideas from management gurus like Peter Drucker and Jim Collins, to help individuals navigate the passage \u201cfrom success to significance.\u201d Among other things, the Halftime Institute\u2019s programs help members find their calling through developing \u201ca personal plan for spiritual growth, a life mission statement and a clear action plan.\u201d\n\nSuch rites and routes also have a place in our secular lives. I\u2019ll soon be returning for my 35th college reunion, like so many other boomers who were part of the dramatic expansion of higher education in the 1960s and 1970s. Reunions are a tailor-made opportunity to help individuals graduate into the second half of adulthood, using to full advantage their return to a setting associated with new beginnings, a sense of possibility and community.\n\nAlready a number of higher-education institutions are offering reunion workshops on the subject of \u201cwhat\u2019s next.\u201d Others have gone further. Northwestern University conducted a two-part webinar for alumni helping them consider and prepare for second acts aimed at improving prospects for future generations, featuring the accounts of classmates who had navigated that journey.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nDesign schools for the second half of life.\n\nNearly 50 years ago, we pioneered lifelong learning for seniors\u2014a notable advance, but let\u2019s face it: All too often these programs are great for mental stimulation but ill-suited to launching individuals into new life chapters. Catching up on the Renaissance masters or mapping your family\u2019s genealogy can take you only so far.\n\nWhat we need now is school designed for the second half of life, helping people retool to continue to earn an income, maintain a sense of engagement, and adapt to fresh challenges by teaching them new skills and helping them plan their encore careers.\n\nIn recent years, two elite universities\u2014Harvard and Stanford\u2014have broken important new ground, introducing yearlong programs to fill these needs. Both involve reflection, learning, interaction with colleagues, and the chance to explore options for a next act of purpose and productivity. Both offer an opportunity to customize an interdisciplinary course of study with an eye to helping students launch second acts as social entrepreneurs or move into new organizational roles drawing on past experience in creative ways.\n\nBut this is only a beginning, albeit a promising one.\n\nWhat\u2019s warranted now is a far more broad-based effort. We need a system of easily accessible and affordable opportunities for all those interested in working beyond traditional retirement age, one that includes more community-college and continuing-education options, and that builds on existing trends in education innovation, including online courses and the competency-based movement to provide credit for experience and learning acquired outside the classroom.\n\nThere\u2019s some movement to make that happen: In March, two dozen leaders from across higher education came together at New York University to discuss democratizing and expanding their offerings for individuals moving beyond midlife. If they succeed, these trailblazers might not only further the reinvention of school for the second half of life but rewrite the educational script entirely.\n\nAfter all, why is it that we load up all our higher education and higher-education spending in life\u2019s first two dozen years, when individuals have so many decades stretching out in front of them? It\u2019s hard to know at 20 what we\u2019ll want or need to know at 50 or 60. That\u2019s why we should develop an approach to learning that allows for multiple opportunities to renew and retrain across the extended life course of the 21st century.\n\nFigure out how to finance the bonus years.\n\nAlong with fashioning new kinds of education and career pathways, we should help ensure that Americans are able to pay for them\u2014and for all those years being added to the lifespan.\n\nFinancial-services companies could provide a great service through creating and marketing what might be called individual purpose accounts, or IPAs\u2014a kind of 529 savings plan for grown-ups. Such plans could help subsidize the new pathways to un-retirement, funding further education and other learning opportunities. They might also complement individual retirement accounts and related savings vehicles for retirement itself.\n\nAnother potentially far-reaching idea: Allow people 50 and older to take a single early year of Social Security to retool for their next career, whether by going back to school or doing an internship, in exchange for working an actuarially adjusted period later before receiving full benefits.\n\nDoing so promises a win-win: helping individuals bolster their finances through working longer, while also enabling society to realize the talent windfall present in the older population, especially in high-growth fields like health care. Some people will earn a robust living, while others will use their new skills in part-time or flexible jobs that fill a financial gap and allow them to delay dipping into retirement funds.\n\nHelp the generations come together.\n\nFor half a century, we\u2019ve done much to keep young and old apart, especially in the realm of housing. Yet age-segregated housing for retirees runs against the grain of everything we know about healthy development in the post-midlife period, a time when connections with younger generations are linked to higher rates of happiness for older people. What we need instead: housing strategies that help to forge and solidify bonds among the generations.\n\nOne compelling example is Bridge Meadows. This housing development in Portland, Ore., brings together families raising foster children with older people of modest means, who receive reduced rents in return for volunteer work with the adoptive families living in the community: everything from baby sitting and playing catch with children to working on arts-and-crafts projects and making meals. It\u2019s an arrangement that makes both economic and common sense, filling the fundamental human need for community and connection.\n\nI\u2019d like to see more housing development animated by that same compelling vision\u2014especially as more families show an interest in moving in together, sometimes with three or four generations residing under the same roof. (A 2011 study by the nonprofit Generations United found that approximately one in six Americans resides in a multigenerational household, a 10% jump since the start of the recession.) We now likewise have an expanding cohort of individuals without children or grandchildren of their own, along with millions who don\u2019t live anywhere near their younger relatives. These individuals might well be drawn to, and benefit from, such intergenerational settings.\n\nWhile we\u2019re at it, we should create a Legacy Corps: one that recruits millions of older people to be extra \u201cgrandparents\u201d for young people in early-learning programs and mentors for children growing up facing tough odds. In essence, it could be a new kind of Peace Corps for the generation that the Peace Corps was designed for in the first place. There\u2019s a healthy dose of self-interest in such an enterprise for the boomers, who will be dependent on these young people as they move into their elderly years.\n\nGet creative people thinking about how to improve our extra years.\n\nInnovations such as those I\u2019ve just described have drawn little attention from investors to date. As a result, most remain small in scale, if not solely in the realm of ideas.\n\nOf 35 grants made by the federal government\u2019s Social Innovation Fund since 2010, only one has directly targeted aging. Philanthropy isn\u2019t doing any better. According to data from the Foundation Center, less than 2% of foundation money\u2014often a powerful lever for social innovation\u2014goes into aging.\n\nBut there are promising signs in the U.K., where a new \u00a350 million ($78 million) investment from that country\u2019s Big Lottery Fund is being used to improve the quality of life for older adults, including plans to support innovative initiatives in work, health and community engagement. We would be smart to develop our own version.\n\nPrizes are another great option for attracting talent to tackle the issues surrounding second acts. A $1 million Palo Alto Longevity Prize, with a who\u2019s who of Silicon Valley backing it, has been offered for the next big breakthrough in extending life. Why not use similar vehicles to achieve the same result in social innovation aimed at enriching the later years?\n\nThe X Prize, for instance, is aimed at big innovations that benefit mankind. I\u2019d like to see a prize for the innovation that does the most to increase the productivity and contribution of older people to society\u2014especially since the founder of the X Prize Foundation, Peter Diamandis, is co-founder of the Human Longevity Inc. startup (along with genome pioneer J. Craig Venter ), aimed at \u201cextending the healthy human lifespan.\u201d\n\n***\n\nDoes this agenda sound daunting? Here\u2019s reassuring news. We\u2019ve seen this challenge before\u2014and met it.\n\nIn 1961, John F. Kennedy took office eight days after the first White House Conference on Aging. Two years later, President Kennedy gave his most important speech on aging, declaring that America was on the brink of a longevity revolution, filled with promise but marked by a gap: We had added \u201cyears to life,\u201d he pronounced; now it was time to add \u201clife to those years.\u201d\n\nIn impressively short order, we closed that era\u2019s gap, through first conceiving the idea of leisure-focused \u201cgolden years,\u201d then proceeding to make this marketing slogan a cornerstone of the American dream. In a remarkable period of social invention, we fashioned senior centers and retirement communities, Elderhostel (now Road Scholar) and Institutes for Learning in Retirement, Medicare and the Older Americans Act. We not only enriched those later years, but set in motion the conditions that contributed to longer, healthier, more active lives.\n\nNow, as we prepare for the sixth White House Conference on Aging, taking place next month, and as the years added to life continue to trend upward, let\u2019s rise to the occasion again, realizing the true promise of longevity for individuals and for nations.\n\nAnd let\u2019s do it in time for the onrushing wave of baby boomers\u2014but, most of all, for those young people projected to live even longer. I hope that when they sail by the virtual billboards of tomorrow, propelled by their self-driving cars, they will be greeted not by scary longevity scenarios but by an inviting vision of their own later years.\n\nMr. Freedman is the founder and chief executive officer of Encore.org, a nonprofit organization working to promote encore careers, and author, most recently, of \u201cThe Big Shift: Navigating the New Stage Beyond Midlife.\u201d He can be reached at encore@wsj.com.", "date": null, "title": "How to Make the Most of Longer Lives"}

Illustration: Lou Beach\n\nScientists are discovering something very peculiar about aging: How we feel about getting old matters. A lot.\n\nIn test after test, researchers are finding that if we think about getting older in terms of decline or disability, our health likely will suffer. If, on the other hand, we see aging in terms of opportunity and growth, our bodies respond in kind.\n\nScientists are discovering something very peculiar about aging: thinking about getting older in terms of decline or growth can dictate how our bodies respond. WSJ's Anne Tergesen has details on Lunch Break With Tanya Rivero.\n\nThat research holds out the possibility for much healthier aging. But it also points to a very big obstacle: Negative stereotypes about aging are pervasive in America. Even many older adults embrace the idea that getting old is a bad thing\u2014which means they\u2019re doing potentially serious harm to their health without realizing it.\n\nCan we change the way we feel about aging\u2014and improve our prospects for healthier senior years? A growing body of research offers hope.\n\nPsychologists and neuroscientists are identifying strategies that individuals can use to improve their mind-sets about aging, with benefits for their health and well-being. In a recent study, for example, researchers at institutions including the Yale School of Public Health found that older individuals who were subliminally exposed to positive messages about aging showed long-term improvements in self-image, strength and balance. Other recent studies have shown that it\u2019s possible to achieve similar results with tactics that psychologists, cognitive therapists and educators use to treat depression, combat race and gender bias, and break people of harmful habits, such as smoking.\n\nNegative stereotypes about aging \u201care a public-health issue,\u201d says Becca Levy, an associate professor of epidemiology and psychology at the Yale School of Public Health and lead author of the Yale study. \u201cWhat people aren\u2019t aware of is that they have the ability to overcome and resist negative stereotypes\u201d and \u201ccompensate for the ill effects of automatic ageism.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, here are four ways people can better protect themselves from the potentially harmful effects of stereotypes about aging.\n\n1. Understand the myths vs. the facts\n\nExperts say the first step in overcoming negative stereotypes about aging is simply to understand how they work and recognize just how debilitating the consequences can be.\n\nStereotypes in general\u2014negative and positive\u2014are entrenched in part because they help us take cognitive shortcuts. By offering a way to \u201cautomatically categorize people into social groups,\u201d they allow us to \u201cfree up mental energy to\u201d live our daily lives, says Michael North, an assistant professor of management and organizations at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. \u201cIf we were to try to make sense of everything and everybody we encounter, we wouldn\u2019t have enough attention left over to be functional human beings.\u201d\n\nSome stereotypes about older adults are positive: the kind grandparent; the elder statesman; the spry matriarch. But \u201cin most Western societies, the perception of age and aging is predominantly negative,\u201d says Dana Kotter-Gruehn, a visiting assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University in Durham, N.C.\n\nScientists aren\u2019t sure exactly how holding negative stereotypes affects health, but they say it\u2019s clear that there is a connection, and it isn\u2019t simply correlation. In test after test, negative stereotypes have been shown to lead to poor health results. Over the past two decades, dozens of studies from psychologists, medical doctors and neuroscientists have shown that older people with more negative views of aging fare more poorly on health than those with less-pessimistic attitudes.\n\nEven when study participants have similar health, education levels and socioeconomic status, those with more negative outlooks about aging show greater declines in a variety of areas over time. They have shakier handwriting, poorer memories, higher rates of cardiac disease and lower odds of recovering from severe disability, according to studies by Prof. Levy. They are less likely to eat a balanced diet, exercise and follow instructions for taking prescription medications as they age. They even die younger\u2014the median difference in survival rates is 7.5 years.\n\nNone of which is to say that some negative views of aging aren\u2019t true. We certainly can experience declines in physical strength as we age, and our senses tend to weaken, too. But it\u2019s important to realize that many other things that are broadly accepted just aren\u2019t true.\n\nFor example, far from feeling more depressed or lonely than younger people, older people tend to express greater satisfaction with their relationships. Some studies have found that, at work, older workers make fewer errors than their younger counterparts. And research suggests that memory can be enhanced in old age.\n\nThe lesson: While most people assume aging can be explained entirely \u201cas a physiological process,\u201d Prof. Levy says, \u201cbeliefs about aging, which are taken from the culture, have an impact.\u201d\n\nEducation, then, is a start: getting beyond myths about aging and, equally important, understanding (as a growing body of research indicates) that our moods, relationships and overall sense of well-being actually can improve with age, as can knowledge and certain types of intelligence.\n\nA forthcoming study demonstrates that education alone can have a big impact on how we look at aging. Psychologists at Colorado State University conducted an experiment aimed at improving attitudes about aging among 62 sedentary adults, ages 53 and older. Over the course of a month, the participants attended two-hour weekly classes aimed at debunking age stereotypes and received instruction in ways to set achievable fitness goals.\n\nThe findings: \u201cPeople\u2019s negative views on aging became much more positive,\u201d says Manfred Diehl, a co-author and professor of human development and family studies at Colorado State. The participants also increased their levels of physical activity in the two months over which they were monitored afterward.\n\n2. Recognize stereotypes in everyday life\n\nOnce you\u2019re aware of the power of stereotypes, it\u2019s important to be aware of just how pervasive they are. Again, that isn\u2019t to say that none of the messages are true. But we are bombarded by one view of aging without being aware of it, so paying attention is an important way to lessen the impact.\n\nStudies show that negative stereotypes about aging\u2014for example, that older people inevitably grow less productive and more depressed\u2014are as pervasive as they are inaccurate. On television, older adults are often absent or \u201cprovide comic relief by displaying physical or mental incompetence,\u201d Prof. Levy wrote in a 2005 study of 76 television watchers that showed, among other things, that those who watched more television had more negative \u201cimages of aging\u201d than less-frequent viewers.\n\nMore recently, she and other researchers examined 84 Facebook groups that included descriptions of people ages 60 and older. On all but one, they found that negative stereotypes predominated, with 27% of the site descriptions \u201cinfantilizing\u201d older adults and 37% advocating \u201cbanning [older adults] from public activities,\u201d such as shopping.\n\n\u201cBecause there is no PC backlash against it,\u201d ageism is often \u201coverlooked as a form of prejudice,\u201d says Prof. North in New York.\n\nProf. Levy recommends keeping a diary. In the 2005 study of television viewers, researchers asked about half of the 76 participants to evaluate in writing the physical and cognitive health of older television characters. The other half were asked to simply record the names of the shows they watched. After a week, the scientists surveyed both groups. Those who wrote the detailed evaluations were significantly more aware than the other group was of how elders are presented, the study says.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to acknowledge our own prejudices, says Ashton Applewhite, author of the blogs \u201cThis Chair Rocks\u201d and \u201cYo, Is This Ageist?\u201d\n\nBefore you conclude you don\u2019t have any, take the Implicit Association Test. Harvard University publishes an online version, which psychologists use to measure bias by gauging how quickly test-takers associate pleasant versus unpleasant words with young and old faces.\n\nThe next step is to become more aware of your own thoughts about older people and aging. One thing to guard against: a tendency to \u201cblame things automatically and reflexively on age,\u201d says Ms. Applewhite.\n\nMany older adults automatically attribute physical and health problems to aging, rather than to specific causes that might be treatable. For example, Type 2 diabetes is not caused by age but by a poor diet, lack of exercise and other factors, many of which can be addressed. Others chalk up occasional memory lapses to \u201csenior moments,\u201d rather than to disorganization or busyness; in contrast, someone in their 20s who constantly loses his or her keys would never attribute that to age.\n\nBlaming everything on age can \u201creinforce negative stereotypes in ourselves\u201d that equate aging with decline, says Mary Lee Hummert, a professor at the Gerontology Center at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kan.\n\nA growing number of organizations are pointing out prejudices and stereotypes and helping people overcome them. ChangingAging.org, a nonprofit based in Ithaca, N.Y., sponsors initiatives including \u201cAge of Disruption Tour,\u201d a show currently traveling the country that mixes music with lectures about overcoming aging stereotypes.\n\n3. Substitute positive for negative stereotypes\n\nBut being aware of negative stereotypes isn\u2019t enough. Research shows that negative stereotypes about aging have a much stronger influence over older adults than positive ones\u2014so it\u2019s important to learn to emphasize the good side of aging.\n\nIn recent years, researchers have begun identifying techniques people can use to interrupt negative thoughts about stereotyped groups as they arise\u2014and substitute more positive thoughts.\n\nIn a study published in 2012, researchers at the University of Wisconsin used a combination of techniques to see whether they could reduce the biases of 91 undergraduates.\n\nAfter taking the Implicit Association Test, the 91 participants\u201490% of whom demonstrated more negative associations with black than with white people\u2014were divided into two groups. One group was enrolled in a 45-minute training session, while the other wasn\u2019t given any specific instructions.\n\nThose enrolled in the training session were taught about bias and its consequences and given several techniques designed to substitute positive for negative stereotypes and images. For example, the scientists asked participants to look for examples of people in stereotyped groups who don\u2019t fit the stereotypes. Participants were also instructed to \u201cthink about what it would be like\u201d to be a member of a stereotyped group and to try to have contact with and \u201cobtain specific information\u201d about the individuals in those groups whom they encountered.\n\n\u201cWe explained that if they were motivated to eliminate bias, they could learn and then practice the various bias reduction techniques,\u201d says lead author and psychology professor Patricia Devine.\n\nEight weeks later, all 91 took the test again. Those assigned to the training program showed a larger increase in concern about discrimination and also dramatically less bias than those without it, says Prof. Devine, who believes the same results would hold for age stereotypes. \u201cIt is important to harness the power of the conscious mind to overcome bias of all sorts,\u201d she adds.\n\n4. Accept the aging process\n\nAll that said, it\u2019s important not to go overboard and expect an entirely positive experience of aging. The key is to hold both positive and negative in balance and really understand and own the aging process.\n\nOn average, individuals ages 40 and older report feeling 20% younger than their actual ages\u2014a tendency that can serve a useful psychological purpose.\n\n\u201cBy distancing yourself from your age, you also distance yourself from negative age stereotypes,\u201d says David Weiss, assistant professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health in New York.\n\nBut age denial can also leave us vulnerable to the harmful impact of negative age stereotypes down the road\u2014for example, if we suffer a disability or are confronted by evidence that others view us as old, experts say.\n\nMoreover, \u201cdenying one\u2019s age may be psychologically harmful in that it disassociates us from various important developmental tasks that should take place in later life,\u201d says Prof. Weiss.\n\nThe solution may sound trite, but experts say it\u2019s crucial: \u201cTo embrace aging\u2014both the good and bad,\u201d says geriatrician Bill Thomas, co-founder of ChangingAging.org.\n\nDr. Thomas says it\u2019s important to look not just at the negative changes that take place as we age but also at the positives, such as the improvements scientific studies have shown over time in our interpersonal skills, relationships, expertise and knowledge. While it\u2019s important to accept the negatives\u2014you may, for example, no longer be the runner or tennis player you once were\u2014that doesn\u2019t mean you cannot adapt your game or find other outlets with similar payoffs.\n\nRecent studies point to other techniques we can employ to become more satisfied\u2014or less dissatisfied\u2014with our age.\n\nResearch by Prof. Weiss, for example, concludes that identifying with one\u2019s generation, such as baby boomers\u2019 being proud of the differences they made in the culture, is a way to \u201cembrace a more positive conception of older age\u201d and link people \u201cto a positive social identity or legacy that will endure beyond their own lifetime.\u201d In the research, Prof. Weiss and a co-author found that older people who thought about their generations reported better well-being.\n\nYet another solution: exercise. While the health benefits of physical activity are widely known, a 2012 study shows that exercise can also leave us feeling better about the aging process.\n\nResearchers at the Berlin medical center Charit\u00e9 Campus Benjamin Franklin enrolled 247 women, ages 70 to 93, and randomly divided them into three groups. During three 90-minute sessions each week, one group attended a computer class, while another took an exercise program. The third group was told to stick to their normal routines.\n\nAfter six months, the exercise group reported the highest level of satisfaction with aging, says Verena Klusmann, lead author and psychologist at the Universities of Konstanz and Bremen. (All three groups started at similar satisfaction levels.)\n\n\u201cThese women were more physically fit, more alert and had better executive functioning. The positive experience of exercising affected their well-being and improved attitudes about aging,\u201d she says.\n\nMs. Tergesen is a staff reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

How do you find a rewarding second career? How do you stay close with friends and family? How do you maintain independence and mobility? How do you embrace new experiences?\n\nThe equally simple answer: technology.\n\nThe next-generation retiree will have an unprecedented array of technologies and tech-enabled services to invent a new future for working part time, remaining social, having fun and staying healthy. MIT AgeLab DirectorJoseph Coughlin joins Lunch Break with Tanya Rivero. Photo: Getty\n\nThe next-generation retiree will have an unprecedented array of technologies and tech-enabled services to invent a new future for working part time, remaining social, having fun, living at home, staying healthy and arranging care.\n\nMany of the solutions will be driven by the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d\u2014where household objects can use Internet connections to think, talk and communicate with one another, enabling an entirely new on-demand service industry for older adults. Kitchen appliances will monitor a person\u2019s diet and relay that information to a doctor. Older people will order up services they need to handle chores that have become too difficult, everything from housecleaning to car rides. Even clothing will connect people to a larger network of services that will monitor, manage and motivate them well into older age.\n\nThis new world of retirement will come with plenty of challenges\u2014among them, costs and possible loss of privacy. But if the challenges can be met, these innovations could transform retirement into a new and vibrant period of life that is about living better as much as it is about living longer.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at some of the innovations.\n\nStaying on the job\n\nRetirement was once a clear line between work and not working. Today, a career may be completed, but work is not over. Recent AARP research suggests that nearly four out of 10 baby boomers are planning to work in retirement. Some over-50s report that they plan to work until they drop. These days, that\u2019s easier hoped for than done. Not only do older people battle the preconceptions of bosses and co-workers about older workers, but they also face a rapidly changing work environment that demands new skills. And they\u2019re often forced to think of work in a new way, as a series of contract projects rather than a regular job.\n\nNow technology is offering new options and flexibility. Telecommuting isn\u2019t a new idea, but it\u2019s crucial for retirees who want the freedom to accept whatever opportunities suit them without disrupting their lifestyle. With smartphones and tablets, the newly retired can be productive from home, beachfront or grandchild\u2019s playground.\n\nThe Internet also frees retirees from having to seek out colleges to brush up on job skills. Massive open online courses, or MOOCs, let retirees learn what they need to stay competitive or enter a new field.\n\nThe available training isn\u2019t just for work skills. There\u2019s also help available online for retirees who want to practice their interview technique. Artificial-intelligence-based coaches will help retirees test themselves with a variety of virtual interviewers. An avatar will shoot tough questions their way, readying them for an interview with a potential boss who is younger than their own children.\n\nAll of that applies to retirees who will want to seek out a traditional professional job behind a desk. But the Internet is also opening up options for retirees who don\u2019t want to be confined to an office, who want a sort-of retirement. Consider peer-to-peer companies, which let people connect with other people to order services. It often doesn\u2019t take special training or experience to hire oneself out to these services, and they provide the ultimate in flexibility. Active retirees who don\u2019t mind spending the day on the road, for instance, might sign up to become drivers with Uber.\n\nThe peer-to-peer economy can also help retirees earn an income from one of the biggest investments they\u2019ve made over their lifetime: their house. Services like Airbnb let retirees rent out space in the family home\u2014which probably has lots of room now that their children have gone. Airbnb recently reported on its blog that 10% of its hosts are over 60 years old.\n\nStaying connected to friends and family\n\nMost people worry about their physical health in older age, but well being is strongly related to the ability to maintain a social life. Friends, family and regular social interaction keep people vital\u2014yet many retirees end up feeling isolated as friends and family scatter. And, of course, many retirees must face the loneliness that comes after the loss of a spouse.\n\nApplications such as Skype already make it possible to enjoy a virtual dinner with a distant grandchild, and communication is due to get even easier and more elegant. For one thing, communication will break free from the confines of a computer or television screen: Imagine an entire wall of the home projecting images of distant friends, letting people share coffee together.\n\nSocial media, meanwhile, will get more specialized as sites begin catering to older adults who want to get online and stay connected. One online community, from Connected Living Inc., connects older adults in senior housing with each other and their families; it has signed up more than 60,000 users in 36 states over the past seven years.\n\nSites are also springing up that help older adults find romance. Over-50 dating site OurTime.com, affiliated with Match, has seen more than two million people join in the past year. And tech-savvy retirees are transforming social sites once thought to be only for the young, such as Facebook, into their hangouts to share and connect with friends and family alike.\n\nTechnology may also help ease face-to-face contact with friends and family. Older adults may find themselves forgetting crucial details about someone, even a close acquaintance, which can lead to frustration and embarrassment. Augmented-reality glasses in development now\u2014think Google Glass\u2014will project reminders in front of users\u2019 eyes when they run into someone: the last conversation they shared, for instance, or the names of their children. The glasses will provide other helpful information, depending on context. If the retiree invites the friend home for dinner, the glasses can provide step-by-step instructions to prepare a meal from a new recipe.\n\nStaying mobile\n\nBeing able to get around independently is a crucial ingredient to a quality life in older age\u2014visiting a friend or going out at for an ice-cream cone on a hot summer night. Research shows that reduced mobility to go where you want when you want leads to declines in both mental and physical well being.\n\nOnce again, technology is serving up solutions. Autonomous technologies, such as automatic parking, collision warnings and blind-spot detection, will make it possible for retirees to keep driving safely and longer than they otherwise would. Looking even further ahead, we can expect autonomous vehicles to take over driving entirely; all a retiree will have to do is text their self-driving car to pull up and take them anywhere.\n\nStill, some retirees won\u2019t want the burden of owning and maintaining a vehicle, or won\u2019t have particularly strong feelings about giving up the driver\u2019s seat. For them, there are services like Lyft and Uber that promise a ride with the touch of the smartphone.\n\nAnd here, too, high-tech goggles may play some role in diminishing the frustration that comes with limited mobility. When real-world travel becomes too difficult for retirees to manage, these goggles will provide the option of virtual travel. Headsets such as the Oculus Rift integrate high-quality graphics and software to deliver immersive and interactive experiences. Using videogame technology, retirees can tour a Paris museum or feel the bumps of a jeep ride on African safari, all from their favorite chair.\n\nA house that keeps itself\n\nTaking care of a home can be a fraught issue for retirees. Many find themselves losing the energy or inclination to tackle cleaning and upkeep. Soon the Internet of Things will help with those jobs, not only making maintenance easier but also transforming the home into a helper, companion and even caregiver.\n\nAlready, there are systems that make it easier to control the basic functions of the home. A smart thermostat and monitoring system enable people to run nearly everything in their home by smartphone while away on vacation. And distant relatives can use those same systems to make sure their loved ones have their home properly heated or cooled.\n\nAppliances may also help retirees by keeping track of things and taking over simple tasks. An Internet-enabled refrigerator, for instance, will maintain a daily inventory of its contents, alert owners when something is low and even arrange for home delivery of favorite foods\u2014saving retirees the burden of keeping an eye on supplies and making regular runs to the store.\n\nNew types of appliances will also begin to appear in retirees\u2019 homes to aid their everyday chores. Early examples include the Roomba vacuum, which can spare owners\u2019 aching backs, and Amazon\u2019s Echo, a compact device that lets people check their schedule, order home deliveries and more, all by voice.\n\nSome appliances will even provide a kind of companionship for retirees who suffer from mental issues or isolation. Paro is a therapeutic robotic seal designed to help calm people with conditions like dementia. The robot has nearly 100 sensors allowing it to respond to touch with movements of its head, flippers and tail; blinking of its eyes; and sounds.\n\nOf course, not all the Internet-enabled household help will come from machines. Internet service companies such as Washio and Hello Alfred are emerging to make aging at home easier, allowing people to summon human helpers to get small jobs done, like taking out laundry to be cleaned or tidying the house.\n\nMachines to monitor health\n\nOne of the frustrating ironies of retirement is that people often find themselves forced to deal with multiple chronic conditions even as their ability to manage those conditions diminishes. Even worse, many people are living with conditions they don\u2019t know about: As people get older, they are more likely to cope with seemingly imperceptible decline, only seeking out medical help when a crisis emerges.\n\nNow the Internet of Things is promising to help retirees\u2014and the family members who are often their primary source of care\u2014stay on top of their health. Machines might keep track of details a retiree might find hard to remember during an appointment, or might not think to be concerned about. An intelligent coffee maker might communicate wirelessly with a smart toothbrush, and together they would learn what time their owners typically wake. Sleep late or wake early, and the gadgets will alert a physician that the retiree has broken with routine. A tricked-out bathroom, meanwhile, will feature a mirror that scans owners\u2019 faces to detect warning signs of cardiovascular disease and risks of heart attack or stroke.\n\nDevices would also monitor physical data that can be a burden for retirees to record and report. A smart toilet, for one, might report to a distant call center its owner\u2019s weight, blood-glucose level and other vitals.\n\nClothes will also go high-tech. Smart materials and sensors woven into underwear will detect retirees\u2019 activity level and vitals such as heart rate. Eventually, these clothes will have features that will reduce the chance of injury by cushioning the impact should the retiree fall. But before that happens, sensors in the carpet will detect that a retiree\u2019s walk has become a shuffle and alert family or physician.\n\nRobots will put in an appearance here, too, to spare retirees and families the burden of daily worry and traveling to constant doctors\u2019 appointments. Operated by a remote nurse, a robot will roll through the home to check in on retirees, review vitals and even have a chat before returning to sleep mode in a corner.\n\n***\n\nClearly, the transformative potential of all these technologies is powerful. But let\u2019s pause for a reality check. These innovations bring new questions of their own.\n\nFor one, there\u2019s cost. The services the Internet of Things will provide will become so convenient, and so vital to our care and well being, that they will be a significant and necessary cost. Yet most people already aren\u2019t saving enough for retirement. How much more will they need to put aside? And will the added costs increase the already-growing divide between the haves and the have-nots in America?\n\nIt also means some institutions will need to rethink how they deal with older Americans. If people can live longer at home, will we need as much senior housing as we do now? And how will health care adapt to the data coming from smart toilets, toothbrushes and toasters? Most doctors and nurses have little time to fully discuss a health condition during a visit, let alone monitor endless streams of data.\n\nOn the individual level, what does it mean when people\u2019s homes and even clothes are collecting big data about their most personal behaviors? The privacy issues of big data aren\u2019t confined to older people, of course, but they are among the most vulnerable members of society, so the concerns are especially pressing.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s vital to remember that technology alone won\u2019t solve our problems. However powerful our gadgets and appliances become, they will never be able to entirely replace the human touch, or completely remove the normal pains and frustrations of getting older.\n\nAnd they won\u2019t be able to deliver their fullest benefits unless we have a compelling vision of what we want retirement to be. Even now, expectations and the very context of how we live are changing so quickly that it\u2019s tough for many retirees to know what they\u2019re supposed to do during this next stage of life. Unlike previous generations that only had to plan for a few years of life after work, baby boomers and those that follow must anticipate decades.\n\nThe ultimate retirement plan for individuals and society is to imagine an older age that is more than simply living longer: a new, exciting period of life that is about living better.\n\nDr. Coughlin is director of the AgeLab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

But that may not always lead to lasting happiness. Geriatric psychiatrist Dr. Marc Agronin joins Shelby Holliday to discuss. Photo: iStock\n\nFor many seniors, the bucket list has become the ultimate celebration of aging.\n\nHealthier, heartier and richer than generations of retirees before them, they\u2019re spending their golden years chasing once-in-a-lifetime adventures\u2014sky diving from 13,000 feet, hiking the Great Wall of China, swimming with sharks or skiing the Andes. For them, it\u2019s the chance to do things they put off for years while working and caring for family, and to make the most of the moments they have remaining.\n\nWhat\u2019s not to love about a life of dream vacations and big thrills?\n\nUnfortunately, quite a bit.\n\nAs a therapist, I\u2019ve talked to numerous seniors as both patients and colleagues. Rather than feeling exhilarated by a life of bucket-list adventures, they often end up feeling depressed and disconnected.\n\nAs they travel the world to soak up experiences, too many seniors inevitably lose track of what really matters\u2014their connections to family, friends and community. They feel like strangers in their own homes. Eventually, the bucket list becomes something of an addiction: The high from an adventure doesn\u2019t last, so seniors find themselves piling on experiences to keep the thrills coming, further alienating them from real life back home.\n\nThere\u2019s a way out of this trap. Retirees should think about using all of the advantages that make a bucket list possible, such as wealth and vigor, to build something much deeper and more meaningful. Instead of taking a dream vacation to chase fleeting thrills, they should use their time to create something more lasting instead\u2014whether that means building bonds with family or their community or reimagining travel adventures as an opportunity to share experiences and wisdom with grandchildren.\n\nThe explorer comes home\n\nAll of this can be seen in the tale of a patient of mine, whom I\u2019ll call Dora to protect her identity.\n\nShe and her husband spent several months and considerable treasure each year after retirement traveling to a bucket list of exotic locales, but found themselves feeling increasingly alienated from family and friends who did not share in their adventures. Their children complained that they seemed more interested in spending time with itinerant acquaintances than with their grandchildren. Several friends became reticent to invite them on weekend outings, fearing that any such plans paled in comparison with their many adventures.\n\nDora and her husband began to see life between trips as boring interludes. They were world travelers untethered from any deeply satisfying social, civic or spiritual connections and responsibilities.\n\nDuring her first appointment, Dora regaled me with stories of her travels but also described symptoms of depression. She saw these trips as both thrilling and empowering triumphs over her aging self, as escapes from her fears and perceived failures.\n\nBut in time, she also began to see her bucket list as an antidote devoid of any enduring communion with family or friends. It didn\u2019t give her any roles as a guide or mentor that had been so satisfying earlier in life. She felt like a spectator to the lives and locales of others, collecting hundreds of photos that were destined to sit unseen in the myriad flash drives she brought home.\n\nThe solution? She and her husband all but gave up the bucket-list approach. They are now spending more time with family and friends, and feel much happier and more connected.\n\nIllustration: Stephen Webster for The Wall Street Journal\n\nForget thrills\n\nIt is easy to see, of course, the powerful forces that make the bucket list so enticing these days. Along with longer lifespans and more cash to spend, retirees have more freedom from day-to-day obligations, now that so many family members live at a great distance from each other. The world has also gotten flatter and the Internet has made arranging travel easier, making it possible to live out fantasies that would have been almost unthinkable 20 to 30 years ago. Besides, the experiences can, of course, be extraordinary.\n\nBut chasing bucket-list thrills ignores a deep psychological truth: You don\u2019t need to make yourself happy in old age. We get happier naturally as we grow older.\n\nSeveral key surveys, including the U.S. General Social Survey and the Gallup Healthways Well-Being Index, have found that well-being starts out quite high in early adulthood, reaches a nadir in midlife and then increases to a peak in our later years. The increased happiness doesn\u2019t come through doing but simply through being. It is the natural result of lower expectations and ambition, less emotional volatility, increased gratitude and acceptance and enhanced problem-solving skills.\n\nIn fact, the need for a bucket list goes against our deepest instincts as we age. Older brains are less influenced by novelty-seeking and more by conscientiousness; they are less impetuous and more emotionally stable. They are somewhat slower in data processing but more experienced and careful and less ideological.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, in living out one\u2019s later years as a series of memorable and momentous adventures, people are making a choice to focus on what one can do instead of what one can be. And that leads to isolation and depression, as with my patient Dora.\n\nDream bigger\n\nSo what\u2019s the alternative? In some sense, having a bucket list isn\u2019t in theory such a bad thing. The key is what\u2019s on that bucket list.\n\nRetirees, for instance, should ask themselves a series of questions when planning an activity: What is my mission? Is it simply to have fun? To spend time with a partner? To learn about history or a geographic location?\n\nThe answers will show the depth and meaning of the activity within one\u2019s life, and predict its impact on others. Some of our dearest pursuits bring the most meaning and joy because they are done for others. Being mindful of our motives and our legacy enables us to see ourselves as part of a bigger picture that extends beyond our own lifetime.\n\nVery often, thinking this way leads people to give up notions of traveling the world to seek adventure. Instead, they tap their strengths and become mentors and role models\u2014whether as volunteers, community leaders or care givers. Though these roles are sometimes discounted as conventional, staid pathways, they offer meaning and excitement that adventure travel doesn\u2019t.\n\nI regularly hear this perspective from the older volunteers at the nursing home where I work: Their days are filled with life-affirming, gut-satisfying deeds.\n\nBecoming more involved with family is another option. Forget the one-time swim with dolphins or sharks and instead spend time teaching a grandchild to swim or fish. These activities require considerable investment in time, energy and emotion. But they offer a way to forge life-sustaining connections and inspiration in an era when there are no longer many multigenerational households and most of our elders are increasingly segregated into their own communities.\n\nOr consider taking bucket-list adventures, but imbue them with purpose. Instead of embarking on a trip to Antarctica, for example, why not a family excursion to a destination that will engage children and grandchildren and teach them about their history and heritage?\n\nVigorous and vital\n\nThis approach is embodied by my retired neighbors who take each of their three grandchildren on their own annual outing based on shared research, selection and preparation. As a result, these children are growing up with a vision of later life as vigorous and vital, not to mention all the personal time spent with their grandparents.\n\nThen there\u2019s a patient who had aspirations for a bucket-list trip to Europe, but felt he could not easily bring along his wife, since she had memory problems and was more than he could care for alone on a trip. Instead, he planned a family pilgrimage to his ancestral home in Spain that included his wife, children and grandchildren\u2014all of whom got a view into their own rich cultural heritage and learned a lifelong lesson about the importance of caring for a loved one with a disability.\n\nAre such trips as exciting as zip-lining in the rain forest, as a three-month sailing trip to nowhere? Superficially, no. But look a little deeper and I have no doubt that people who take a trip to Spain with children and grandchildren, or volunteer at a local community center, are much more content, much happier, than the passive voyeurs who whiz by, thrilled with the speed and all the photos, but sadly missing the bigger picture.\n\nDr. Agronin is a geriatric psychiatrist at Miami Jewish Health Systems in Miami and the author of \u201cHow We Age: A Doctor\u2019s Journey into the Heart of Growing Old.\u201d He can be reached at reports@wsj.com.", "date": null, "title": "It\u2019s Time to Rethink the Bucket-List Retirement"}

Stovall actually is the first to admit that the Predictor has no scientific basis. Still, academics have studied it. And Wall Street has a tradition of quirky indicators, perhaps because serious indicators fail so often.\n\n\u201cThere is no intellectual backing for this sort of thing,\u201d Mr. Stovall says of the Predictor, \u201cexcept that it works.\u201d\n\nHere is what Predictor fans watch for: A win by an original National Football League team\u2014from the days when there was an NFL and an American Football League, before the 1966 merger pact\u2014means the market will be up for the year. A win by a descendant of the AFL sends the market down. Teams created since the merger count for their conference, National or American. (It helps that Pittsburgh, though in the American conference, is an original NFL team, since it has won six times in \u201cup\u201d years.)\n\nIt worked again in 2015 as an old AFL team, the New England Patriots, won and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.2% for the year. The last time the indicator fumbled was 2008 (the New York Giants won, but stocks slid).\n\nThe Super Bowl as an investing tool?

The Wharton graduate began his career in the 1950s when Elvis Presley was just starting to record. \u201cI got a job as a morning newswire editor at E.F. Hutton & Co., a nice firm at 61 Broadway,\u201d he says, \u201cMr. Hutton was still alive. I would show up early and write a newsletter picking the major headlines from whatever publications we could get.\u201d\n\nIf that sounds like tweeting before computers, he also helped to break ground in financial TV as a regular on \u201cWall Street Week.\u201d As his 90th birthday approaches, nine days after the Super Bowl on Feb. 7, he is still at work for National Investment Services in Tampa, Fla.\n\nHe isn\u2019t rooting for a team, but he hopes stocks rise in 2016. A presidential election is \u201ca fairly good background for some bullishness,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are always hopeful that the next one will be better than the one before.\u201d\n\nHe says he doubts that his son Sam Stovall, who is S&P Capital IQ\u2019s U.S. equity strategist, will be interested in taking over the Predictor. Too coincidental an indicator, after all.\n\nBut the younger Mr. Stovall, 60, says he might surprise his dad and take the handoff. True, the Predictor is \u201ccorrelation without causation,\u201d he says, but \u201cI think what Pop did is tremendous.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nMy wife and I are trying to set up a budget for retirement, and we\u2019re wrestling, in particular, with health-care expenses. How can we estimate what our medical bills will look like in the future?\n\nAn important\u2014and vexing\u2014question. For instance, a healthy person will have fewer and/or smaller medical bills in later life, right? Well\u2026maybe not. As a recent study, \u201cAn Apple a Day: The Impact of Health Conditions on the Required Savings\u201d noted, \u201cExcellent health, ironically, can actually raise an individual\u2019s lifetime health spending needs because of the likelihood that healthy 65-year-olds will live much longer.\u201d\n\nA good starting point (and a study worth reading in full) is the \u201c2015 Retirement Health Care Costs Data Report\u201d from HealthView Services Inc., a provider of health-care planning tools in Danvers, Mass. According to HealthView, a healthy 65-year-old couple can expect to pay, on average, $266,589 for insurance premiums and $128,365 for related expenses (dental, vision, copays and out-of-pocket bills) over their lifetime.\n\nAnother good resource\u2014one with an emphasis on prescription-drug costs\u2014is \u201cAmount of Savings Needed for Health Expenses for People Eligible for Medicare\u201d from the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. The study estimates that a couple, where both spouses have median drug expenses, would need $259,000 to have a 90% chance of having enough money to cover health-care bills in retirement.\n\nNote: Neither report accounts for possible long-term-care expenses. For that piece of the puzzle, check out Genworth Financial \u2019s 2016 \u201cCost of Care Survey.\u201d\n\nI am due to begin required withdrawals from my retirement savings. What are the advantages and disadvantages of an annual lump-sum withdrawal as opposed to a monthly payout?\n\nIn most cases, a required minimum distribution, or RMD, in the form of a single annual payout causes fewer problems\u2014if you have a good amount of self-discipline.\n\nYes, monthly withdrawals act like a regular paycheck. But, to take a worst-case scenario, if you die midyear, your family must withdraw the remaining RMD, says Carolyn McClanahan, founder of Life Planning Partners Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla. Figuring out how much has already been withdrawn and how much remains to be withdrawn can (at times) be a hassle.\n\nWith a single lump sum, you can deposit the funds in a savings account and then arrange for monthly transfers to your checking account, creating (in effect) a regular paycheck. And if you wait until November or December to take an RMD\u2014when you have a clear picture of all your income for that year\u2014you can calculate your tax withholding on the withdrawal more accurately.\n\nThe one cautionary note about a single annual withdrawal: willpower, or the lack thereof. \u201cSome people spend it all at once if they take it as a lump sum,\u201d Ms. McClanahan says.\n\nI have a question about paying my grandchildren\u2019s tuition. I understand that if I pay the institution directly there is no tax consequence for my grandchild or me. Does this apply only to tuition or does it include room and board?\n\nThe answer: just tuition. But you have some flexibility here.\n\nTo start, the \u201ctax consequence,\u201d in this case, is the federal gift tax. You can give as much as $14,000 in cash or other assets to as many people as you wish each year, and those gifts won\u2019t count against your (the giver\u2019s) lifetime exemption. (In all, you can give away $5.45 million before gift taxes kick in.) If you exceed the $14,000 ceiling in a given year, you have to file a gift-tax return. That said, there are exceptions to these rules.\n\nUnder section 2503(e)(2) of the Tax Code, \u201cany amount paid on behalf of an individual as tuition to an educational organization\u201d is exempt from gift taxes. Note the wording: \u201ctuition.\u201d Period. There\u2019s no mention of associated costs, like books, room and board, etc.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t stop you, however, from paying the grandchild\u2019s tuition\u2014and then either gifting him $14,000 to pay room and board, or paying room and board up to $14,000 directly, says Barry Kaplan, chief investment officer at Cambridge Wealth Counsel in Atlanta. And if both grandparents are alive, each can gift $14,000, for a total of $28,000.\n\nMy husband started taking Social Security at his full retirement age, but continued to work. He is now 75 and still working full time. Over the past 10 years, his benefit has gradually increased because of cost-of-living adjustments and his continuing contributions (via his paychecks) to Social Security. I am nearing full retirement age and am trying to figure out how much I would receive as a spousal benefit. I know that\u2014at my full retirement age\u2014I can qualify for half of my husband\u2019s benefit. But do I get half of what he started receiving 10 years ago, or half of what he is receiving now, including the adjustments to his benefit?\n\nYour spousal benefit would be based on your husband\u2019s current payout, including the cost-of-living adjustments and any increases tied to his continued wages. To get a better idea of how much the spousal benefit will be, says Darren Lutz, a public affairs specialist with the Social Security Administration, your husband can create a \u201cmy Social Security\u201d account at socialsecurity.gov/myaccount to see what his full benefit is, before deductions for Medicare premiums, etc. Then you can visit the agency\u2019s retirement planner for spouses at socialsecurity.gov/women to learn more about potential benefits.\n\nAsk Encore, written by Mr. Ruffenach, a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal, and co-author of \u201cThe Wall Street Journal Complete Retirement Guidebook,\u201d examines financial issues for those thinking about, planning and living their retirement.

As such, we would like to hear what you think. (You can reach us at askencore@wsj.com.) We\u2019ll pass along your thoughts to this retiree and publish some of the best recommendations in a future column.\n\nThis question, of course, is about more than just friendship. A number of studies indicate that social connections promote well-being in later life. A 2010 survey by AARP, the Washington advocacy group, found that a perceived lack of social support and a shrinking network of friends were associated with loneliness, which, in turn, was tied to poor health.\n\nCAN YOU PICK A WINNING STOCK?

We\u2019ve disguised the names of real stocks and will teach you about common indicators you might use to help you choose. VIEW Interactive\n\nThis retiree appears to be on the right track; volunteer work and community service certainly offer opportunities to build new relationships. But what other outlets might help? Again, we welcome your thoughts\n\nIn response to a recent question about Social Security and spousal benefits, you stated that the spousal benefits would be tied to the other spouse\u2019s current payout. However, I thought the spouse\u2019s benefits would not be increased by \u201cdelayed retirement credits.\u201d Thus, if I waited until age 70 to start my benefits, my wife would be limited to the benefit I would have received at 66 and not the actual payments being received. Is this correct?\n\nYes, you\u2019re correct\u2014as was our original answer.\n\nWe received a number of emails and questions about this issue: the different ways in which a person\u2019s Social Security benefit can increase over time and whether those increases will affect spousal benefits.\n\nFor instance, each year (indeed, each month) you delay collecting Social Security your payout increases. Cost-of-living adjustments and wage recalculations also help increase the size of one\u2019s benefit. (For people who continue to work after they claim Social Security, the agency will review their benefits annually to see if their continuing contributions to Social Security result in a larger monthly check.)\n\nBut these increases don\u2019t always have the same effect on spousal benefits. Here are two examples:\n\nLet\u2019s say a husband is eligible for a monthly benefit of $2,000 at his full retirement age of 66\u2014but waits until age 70 to claim Social Security. At that point, his payout, thanks to \u201cdelayed retirement credits,\u201d will total $2,640. (This assumes no increase from wage recalculations; nor are there any cost-of-living adjustments, which don\u2019t kick in until you start taking benefits.)\n\nBut there is a catch here. As the reader above notes, delayed retirement credits aren\u2019t used in calculating spousal benefits. So, if this husband\u2019s wife claims Social Security at her full retirement age, her spousal benefit would total $1,000, or half the amount the husband would have received at age 66.\n\nNow, let\u2019s turn to the situation we addressed in our original column: a husband who, instead of postponing Social Security, elects to collect benefits at his full retirement age. What\u2019s more, he decides to continue working.\n\nLet\u2019s say this husband starts, at age 66, with a monthly benefit of $2,000. As time passes, his benefit will gradually increase, thanks to annual cost-of-living adjustments and (if his annual income is large enough) wage recalculations. And let\u2019s say that, at age 70, this husband\u2019s monthly payout has increased to $2,250.\n\nIn this case, the man\u2019s wife\u2014if she first claims a spousal benefit at her full retirement age\u2014would be eligible for a monthly spousal benefit of $1,125, or half of her husband\u2019s current benefit. Remember: The husband, in this example, hasn\u2019t learned any \u201cdelayed retirement credits.\u201d Rather, his benefit has increased because of COLAs and wage recalculations. And these variables are factored into spousal benefits.\n\nMr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal, and co-author of \u201cThe Wall Street Journal Complete Retirement Guidebook.\u201d His column examines financial issues for those thinking about, planning and living their retirement.

Illustration: Lloyd Miller for The Wall Street Journal\n\nIf you sell your home at a profit, how much of your gain will disappear into Uncle Sam\u2019s pockets?\n\nThis is one of the questions readers ask most often. The topic is particularly timely today, amid growing evidence of continued strength generally in the housing markets.\n\nIn most cases, the tax rules on the sale of your primary residence are highly favorable. Most sellers typically wind up owing no capital-gains tax on their profits, says a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors.\n\nRelated The Psychology of Buying and Selling a House\n\nBut there are important exceptions, such as for those with exceptionally large gains who live in high-tax areas.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of regional variation,\u201d says Len Burman, Robert C. Pozen director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. For example, he says, it is more common to owe taxes on sales in expensive real-estate markets, such as New York City, Los Angeles or Boston, than it is in Peoria.\n\nMany twists and turns in the rules can be taxpayer-friendly. But, as with so many tax questions, the answer typically is: \u201cIt depends.\u201d The answer can vary depending on how long you have owned the home and lived in it as your primary residence. It can also vary depending on the size of your gain and why you sold. It can even vary significantly if you had to sell your home because of some event that you \u201ccould not reasonably have anticipated,\u201d such as unemployment or a death in your family, says Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting.\n\nIn some cases, the rules can be so complex that you may need expert help. But here are the basics:\n\nWhat to expect\n\nMarried couples filing jointly typically can exclude as much as $500,000 of the gain on the sale of their primary residence. Singles can exclude up to $250,000. In most cases, you qualify for the maximum exclusion amount if you have owned your home\u2014and used it as your main home\u2014for at least two of the five years before the sale date. Those 24 months don\u2019t have to be consecutive. They \u201ccan fall anywhere within the 5-year period,\u201d the IRS says in Publication 523.\n\nThis \u201cisn\u2019t a one-time opportunity,\u201d writes Julian Block, an attorney in Larchmont, N.Y. and author of \u201cJulian Block\u2019s Home Seller\u2019s Guide to Tax Savings.\u201d Sellers \u201cmay claim the profit exclusion each time they sell their principal residence, but generally not more frequently than once every two years.\u201d\n\nEven if you don\u2019t qualify for the maximum exclusion, you still may be eligible for major relief depending on several factors, such as why you sold. For example, you may be eligible to claim a partial exclusion if you had to sell because of a \u201cwork-related move,\u201d health reasons\u2014or even, as Mr. Luscombe noted, \u201cunforeseeable events.\u201d\n\nDefining those terms can be tricky. On a work-related move, the IRS says you meet the standard rules if any of the following statements is true for the period during which you owned and lived in the home you sold:\n\n\u2022Your new job is \u201cat least 50 miles farther from home than your old work location.\u201d\n\n\u2022You didn\u2019t have a previous work location and you \u201cbegan a new job at least 50 miles from home.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u201cEither of the above is true of your spouse, a co-owner of the home, or anyone else for whom the home was their residence.\u201d\n\nYou meet the standard rules for the health-related exception if you moved for any of several reasons, such as to \u201cobtain, provide or facilitate diagnosis, cure, mitigation, or treatment of disease, illness or injury for yourself or a family member,\u201d the IRS says. To bolster your case, get a doctor\u2019s note confirming the details. For more details, see Publication 523.\n\nThe definition of an \u201cunforeseeable\u201d event can be broad. As Mr. Block points out, this could include \u201cnatural or man-made disasters or acts of war or terrorism\u201d that damage the residence. Other factors include death, divorce or legal separation\u2014or, as the IRS puts it, \u201ca change in employment status\u201d that results in the inability to pay basic household living expenses.\n\nThere are many other special rules that affect tax obligations, such as those involving divorces. For example, the IRS says you aren\u2019t considered to have a gain or loss \u201cif you transferred your home (or a share of a jointly owned home) to a spouse or ex-spouse as part of a divorce settlement.\u201d In such cases, you don\u2019t have to report anything on your tax forms.\n\nOther issues\n\nStill have questions? Here are some other issues related to home sales and taxes that many homeowners have asked about.\n\nQ: Can\u2019t I defer, or even eliminate, capital-gains taxes simply by selling my home and rolling over the proceeds into another home that costs as much as the old one, or more?\n\nA: No. That law died in the late 1990s.\n\nQ: What happens if I sell my primary residence for less than I paid for it several years ago? Can I deduct that loss as a long-term capital loss?\n\nA: You can\u2019t deduct a loss on the sale, or exchange, of \u201cpersonal use property,\u201d including the loss on the sale of your home used as your personal residence at the time of sale, the IRS says. But you may be able to deduct losses on property used in a trade or business.\n\nQ: I\u2019ve owned and lived in my main home for several years and qualify for the exclusion. But if I sell, my profit would be significantly more than the exclusion amount. How would that additional amount be taxed?\n\nA: The excess above the exclusion amount typically would be considered a long-term capital gain, says Barbara Weltman, a tax expert, consultant and author. The portion of your gain that is taxable \u201cis also treated as investment income for purposes of the 3.8% tax on net investment income,\u201d she says.\n\nMortgage concept. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nQ: What happens if I sell after my spouse dies?\n\nA: If you sell your home within two years after a spouse\u2019s death and you haven\u2019t remarried as of the sale date, you can \u201ccount any time when your spouse owned the home as time you owned it,\u201d the IRS says. Also, you can count \u201cany time when the home was your spouse\u2019s residence as time when it was your residence.\u201d\n\nQ: Are there special rules for the disabled?\n\nA: Yes. There is a break for those who have a disability and can\u2019t take care of themselves physically or mentally. In such cases, \u201cyou only need to show that your home was your residence for at least 12 months out of the 5 years\u201d leading up to the sale date, the IRS says. \u201cIn addition, any time you spend living in a care facility (such as a nursing home) counts toward your residence requirement, so long as the facility has a license from a state or other political entity to care for people with your condition.\u201d\n\nMr. Herman is a writer in New York City.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nFinancial advisers often focus on one person in a family, the breadwinner\u2014leaving the client\u2019s spouse and children in the dark.\n\nIt comes as little surprise, then, that when those breadwinners pass away, many financial advisers report great difficulty in retaining the heirs as clients. Indeed, often the heirs, once they take control of the assets, feel no connection at all to the adviser, whether business or personal.\n\nAdvisers are trying new approaches to connect with the children in meaningful ways while parents are still living, and so improve their chances of securing a family\u2019s business for generations to come.\n\n\u201cMeeting the children at the funeral is probably a little late,\u201d notes David Richman, national director of Eaton Vance Advisor Institute, which supports financial advisers and their practices. \u201cThe advisers who are stepping in more wholeheartedly and going beyond the pie chart are more likely to be seen as an integral part to what\u2019s going on in that family.\u201d\n\nIndustry experts say that losing clients\u2019 children to other advisers is an accelerating problem. Aging baby boomers are passing on assets, and most advisers are unable to keep tech-savvy Gen Xers and millennials as clients. \u201cAdvisers these days are recognizing that they\u2019ve got to bring a lot more to the table than simply focusing on stuff that people feel like they can do online,\u201d Mr. Richman says.\n\nLet\u2019s go to the video\n\nTo help advisers retain more of the next generation as clients, Mr. Richman leads\u2014and videos\u2014workshops in which groups of clients are encouraged to discuss what they see as their legacies and their life priorities. They answer such questions as, \u201cWhat would be the one thing you\u2019d like to hear your child or grandchild know about you when you\u2019re gone?\u201d Mr. Richman says.\n\nThe clients feel comfortable discussing such issues with their peers, more than they would in a formal office setting, one-on-one with an adviser, he says. Afterward, copies of the videos are sent to the advisers for use as the basis for family meetings to celebrate the parents and their stories. The clients and children watch the videos together with the adviser, who acts as a discussion facilitator.\n\nCreating environments where people can speak openly and honestly about their worries and concerns for their heirs is key to reaching those heirs as future clients, says Sandra McPeak, managing director, investments, with Wells Fargo.\n\n\u201cThat has to be done in a very subtle way,\u201d with the parents driving the process, she adds. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go to a client and say, \u2018Hey, I want to meet your kids.\u2019 That feels like fishing.\u201d Instead, she says, at the appropriate moment in a conversation with a client, she\u2019ll say something about her personal life and the financial-planning solutions that have worked with her children. For example, putting them on a budget.\n\n\u201cEvery one of my clients thinks, \u2018Well, my kid needs that, too,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of showing value and basically linking, in the parent\u2019s mind, me to the child\u2014without hitting them over the head.\u201d\n\nFamily letters\n\nMs. McPeak also has her clients draft family letters, or documents that detail what assets the parents have, such as accounts held with Ms. McPeak and safe-deposit boxes, and where they are located.\n\n\u2018We know who all the kids are, we keep in touch with them.\u2019 \u2014Financial adviser Selwyn Herson\n\nShe came up with this concept after doing it for her own family. Many clients will ask her to take care of their children if something happens to them, so the letters ultimately make things easier for the children\u2014allaying a worry, says Ms. McPeak, and binding the children more to the adviser.\n\nSometimes engaging a client\u2019s child after the parent\u2019s death is as simple as choosing the right venue or clothes, especially if there has been little or no interaction to that point. Lori Dorsey, senior vice president and director of marketing at Ivy Investments, says advisers can seem more authentic with their clients\u2019 children by meeting them in a coffee shop instead of the office, or talking about student debt rather than retirement.\n\n\u201cThese are very simple things that are very adaptive for an adviser\u2019s practice,\u201d she says. \u201cEducate them, but in a collaborative, not condescending, way.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, many advisers are using technology to show their value and loop in clients\u2019 children early. Advisers are increasingly competing with robo advisers, automated investment services that millennials and other young investors see as modern and more useful than in-person meetings.\n\nHowever, Hollie Fagan, managing director of BlackRock\u2019s dedicated Registered Investment Advisor consultant team, says just offering a simple technology solution can make the difference between keeping and losing the children. The kinds of things younger clients are looking for, she says, include simple tools to check on one\u2019s portfolio, along with its holdings and performance. Another basic offering is a way to ask questions electronically rather than using the phone.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of ways now that advisers can leverage technology to efficiently offer financial advice at a reasonable price,\u201d she says.\n\nValue of a gift\n\nIn the end, many advisers could begin to capture those 90% of children who flee their parents\u2019 advisers simply by giving them a thoughtful gift. Selwyn Herson, chairman of Cruden Bay Investment Management, says he once bought a share of Nintendo for a client\u2019s 9-year-old son and framed the certificate of ownership. That child, now 14, continues to reference that share and has come to understand how Nintendo makes money for shareholders.\n\n\u201cWe know who all the kids are, we keep in touch with them,\u201d Mr. Herson says. \u201cWe treat them like an adult, and our goal is therefore to develop relationships with the kids and grandkids, so that over time we\u2019ll continue to manage the family\u2019s money.\u201d\n\nMr. Davidson is a writer in San Francisco.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nIf you\u2019re convinced nobody in Washington really cares about you, here\u2019s some advice on how to get an unforgettable reaction from at least one influential government bureaucracy:\n\nTry deducting hefty net losses from an expensive and enjoyable activity, such as photography or horse breeding, that has been a consistent money-loser for many years and has no reasonable hope of ever turning a profit. Use those losses to offset most, or even all, of your other income. While you\u2019re at it, don\u2019t bother creating or writing a formal business plan. Don\u2019t keep any records to substantiate income and expenses\u2014and don\u2019t bother consulting with professional experts on how to be profitable.\n\nFollow these guidelines, and you have a good chance of awakening even the sleepiest agents at the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nWhat others might think of as a real business might strike an IRS agent as a hobby. Why does that matter? Generally, you can deduct legitimate hobby expenses only \u201cup to the amount of your hobby income,\u201d the IRS explains in a \u201ctax tip\u201d dated early last month. But if your expenses exceed your gross income, \u201cyou can\u2019t deduct that loss from your other income.\u201d (This applies not only to individuals but also partnerships, estates, trusts and S corporations.)\n\nThis issue, often lumped under the heading of \u201chobby-loss\u201d cases, has long attracted close scrutiny by tax collectors concerned about possible abuses. The issue also has led to considerable confusion among taxpayers because of the complexity in deciding whether some business ventures are genuinely designed to make money.\n\nBusiness or hobby? \u201cWe deal with this all the time,\u201d says David Lifson, a certified public accountant at Crowe Horwath LLP in New York City.\n\nEven for tax scholars, it can often prove highly taxing to figure out the difference between a legitimate business that is devoted to making a profit and a venture that isn\u2019t. This subject may now attract even more IRS attention thanks to a report issued earlier this year by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, or TIGTA, which contends that the IRS needs to do a better job of policing this area.\n\n\u201cWhile the IRS has taken actions to address hobby loss issues, there are indications that a significant portion still needs to be addressed,\u201d the report said. More pointedly, the report said the IRS \u201ccan improve its methods of addressing taxpayers who offset their income with hobby losses.\u201d\n\nIRS officials are keenly aware of this issue. Responding to the TIGTA report, an IRS official noted several steps the agency has taken. Among them: publishing an audit-technique guide to help IRS examiners figure out whether an activity is engaged in for-profit pursuits.\n\nAs the TIGTA report indicates, this issue isn\u2019t likely to disappear any time soon. Many questions and misunderstandings have sprung up about the complex rules and fine print. What may seem to one taxpayer like a real business venture may strike the IRS very differently. Here is a primer.\n\nFirst, a warning: This subject can be even more complex than it seems, and many taxpayers would be well-advised to hire a tax expert for guidance.\n\nQ: In the IRS\u2019s view, what is the difference between a real business designed to make a profit and a \u201chobby\u201d?\n\nA: The IRS says there are nine factors to consider. \u201cNo one factor alone is decisive,\u201d the IRS says. Check out IRS Publication 535 at irs.gov for details. Also, type \u201cnot-for-profit\u201d in the search box on the IRS website. To see opinions by U.S. Tax Court judges, go to ustaxcourt.gov and look under \u201copinions search\u201d for hobby loss cases, or \u201csection 183.\u201d It\u2019s a long list. Consider reading articles on the subject and key cases by authors such as Peter J. Reilly, a certified public accountant and blogger, and lawyer Robert W. Wood.\n\nQ: How often does a business need to make a profit so that the IRS will presume it is a genuine business?\n\nA: The IRS says it generally presumes an activity is carried on for profit if it made money \u201cin at least 3 of the last 5 tax years, including the current year.\u201d But the test is different for activities consisting mainly of breeding, training, showing or racing horses. In such cases, activities \u201care presumed carried on for profit if they produced a profit in at least 2 of the last 7 tax years, including the current year.\u201d\n\nEven if a venture fails this test, it still might have a chance of success based on the facts and circumstances of its case. \u201cProfits help but do not determine the deductibility of business losses,\u201d Mr. Lifson says. The IRS confirms that point. As one official puts it, \u201cthe absence of a profit in those years does not per se create a presumption that the activity is not engaged in for profit.\u201d\n\nQ: How should hobby expenses be deducted?\n\nA: For starters, the tax return in question must itemize deductions. When itemizing, special rules that are too complicated to deal with here apply to certain types of expenses. Again, see Publication 535.\n\nQ: What kinds of hobby expenses may be deductible up to the limit of the hobby\u2019s income?\n\nA: The IRS says deductions may be allowed for certain \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d hobby expenses. The IRS says an ordinary expense is \u201cone that is common and accepted for the activity.\u201d A \u201cnecessary\u201d expense is \u201cone that is helpful or appropriate.\u201d\n\nQ: How can people bolster their case that they are running a real business that is trying to make money?\n\nA: Keep clear, comprehensive and detailed records, Mr. Reilly says. That includes not only financial details but how much time the venture requires.\n\nAlso, as explained above, making a profit in the specified number of years can win the IRS\u2019s presumption that a business is genuine. Sometimes it can be possible for the income and expenses of the business to be timed so that profits are reported in enough years to pass the \u201cpresumption\u201d test. If there is no profit to report but the filer has a good reason to believe there will be a profit in the future, he or she should gather as much documentation as possible to bolster that case.\n\nTo help demonstrate a venture is conducted in a \u201cbusinesslike\u201d fashion, create a formal, detailed and extensive business plan. Put it in writing. Consider updating it to reflect new ways to improve profitability. Demonstrate special knowledge and expertise in the field, or hire expert advisers.\n\nIf two or more businesses are closely connected, consider grouping them for tax advantages. It isn\u2019t easy, but some taxpayers have succeeded at this. In 2009, the U.S. Tax Court ruled in favor of Tracey L. Topping, who had deducted losses from equestrian activities that she said were part of her plan to develop a profitable interior-design business.\n\n\u201cThe hot issue in the topic concerns \u2018grouping\u2019 two or more activities so that a profit motive from one can be applied to another,\u201d says Barbara Weltman, a tax expert, consultant and author. Under certain circumstances, says Ms. Weltman, \u201cmultiple activities can constitute a single undertaking.\u201d\n\nMr. Herman is a writer in New York City.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/collectible-photographs-without-the-vintage-price-tag-1434049825", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Prices of vintage photographs have soared in recent decades. Photos shot and printed by such artists as Edward Steichen, Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Weston have sold in the millions of dollars at auctions.\n\nFor people who covet these older photographs but recoil at the price tag, however, there is an alternative: buying newer prints of these same photographs for far less than those ones sell for.\n\nA 1970s version of Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz\u2019 1926 photograph \u201cChez Mondrian\u201d would be worth about $10,000, according to dealer Bruce Silverstein, while a \u201cvintage, mounted exhibition print\u201d would be valued at more than $1 million. Photo: Estate of Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz/Courtesy of Bruce Silverstein Gallery, New York\n\nTo be sure, such prints shouldn\u2019t be seen as investments. But let\u2019s start at the beginning. When buying black-and-white images at the higher end, the key considerations are if the photographs are \u201cvintage\u201d prints, made by the photographer within a year or two of when the photo was taken, and if they are \u201ciconic,\u201d or well-known. Add to this the condition of the print. Prints with each of these factors have the highest values in the collectible photography market and the most potential for appreciation.\n\nBut the same images printed years later can be indistinguishable to most people if printed by, say, a family member or someone approved by the photographer or his or her family. Such images, while still pricey, generally sell for much less than vintage images.\n\nConsider works by Mr. Weston, who developed Parkinson\u2019s disease in the 1940s and became unable to print his own images. (He died in 1958.) His eldest son, Brett Weston, also a photographer, began printing some of his father\u2019s most renowned images under his father\u2019s supervision, and made others after his father died. Posthumous images also were printed by Brett Weston\u2019s younger brother, Cole Weston.\n\nBruce Silverstein, a photography dealer in New York, says the 1936 Weston photograph \u201cCharis in the Doorway, Santa Monica\u201d would be priced at $350,000 to $400,000 \u201cif signed by Weston and in good condition.\u201d If printed by Brett Weston and initialed by Edward Weston, it might be priced at $80,000 to $100,000, Mr. Silverstein says. If printed by Brett Weston after his father\u2019s death, closer to $15,000. And if printed by Cole Weston, about $10,000.\n\nContent analysis\n\nPurchasers of nonvintage collectible photos need to understand that they are buying less for investment and more for content\u2014the image. Also on the plus side, newer prints tend to be in much better condition than those older ones. (To be clear, such prints are different than the mass-produced prints that can be bought in any poster shop or downloaded free online. Mass-produced photos, as the term implies, come in unlimited quantities and have no likelihood of appreciating in value.)\n\nPurchasers of vintage images, by contrast, pay a premium for decisions the photographer made in the darkroom when making that particular print\u2014dodging (or lightening) some areas and burning (or darkening) others. To connoisseurs, earlier images also have a different look than those produced years later. For instance, the photographic paper that Edward Weston used in his vintage prints had more silver content, which provides a greater range of tones, than in the printing papers used by his two sons. For nonconnoisseurs, images printed by the artist also may have a signature to stamp on that back that reveals the full story of when and by whom it was produced.\n\nOne pays more for vintage prints because they bring us closer to the artist\u2019s original inspiration when the image was taken. When additional prints are made long after the photograph was taken\u2014even when they are printed by the original photographer\u2014prices are apt to be far lower. Mr. Silverstein says a \u201cvintage, mounted exhibition print\u201d of Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz\u2019s 1926 photograph \u201cChez Mondrian\u201d would be \u201cvalued at more than $1 million, while a 1970s version, even one that the artist himself printed and signed, \u201cwould be worth closer to $10,000.\u201d Sotheby\u2019s sold one of these later impressions for as much as $25,000 in 2007, although the most recent sale high was $15,000 at Sotheby\u2019s in September of last year.\n\nArbus prints\n\nStill, nonvintage prints can rise in value, sometimes in relation to vintage prints by the same artist. New York City gallery owner Edwynn Houk cites famed photographer Diane Arbus (1923-71) and Neil Selkirk, a portrait photographer and the only person authorized to print Arbus images since her death. The Selkirk-printed images generally are priced between $10,000 and $100,000. But the same images printed by Ms. Arbus sell for $75,000 to $600,000, he says.\n\nThe values for both have increased at roughly the same rate, he notes: An Arbus print by Mr. Selkirk 40 years ago might have gone for $100, while one produced by Ms. Arbus would have cost $600. Still, as Mr. Houk notes, the same sizable gap in comparable values remains.\n\nMr. Grant is a writer in Amherst, Mass.

The rules can be surprisingly tricky, and Congress long ago created major hurdles that taxpayers have to clear in order to claim any losses.\n\nThose rules represent \u201ca high bar,\u201d says Brittney Saks, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers and head of the firm\u2019s U.S. personal financial services practice. \u201cPeople think, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve had a casualty loss, I\u2019ll be able to deduct it.\u2019 But once you go through the calculations, including the limitations, they may not get the benefit they had hoped for.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t get too discouraged. One ray of sunshine, for example, is a counterintuitive rule that comes into play for taxpayers with significant losses that occur in a federally declared disaster area. Read on for a worry-free guide to the basic rules on claiming personal-property casualty losses:\n\n\u2022 Casualty losses can result from \u201cthe damage, destruction or loss of your property\u201d from \u201cany sudden, unexpected or unusual event such as a flood, hurricane, tornado, fire, earthquake or volcanic eruption,\u201d the IRS says. A casualty \u201cdoes not include normal wear and tear or progressive deterioration.\u201d\n\n\u2022 For many people, the biggest obstacles lie in two provisions known as the $100 and 10% rules. Here is how the IRS summarizes them: \u201cFor property held by you for personal use, you must subtract $100 from each casualty or theft event that occurred during the year after you have subtracted any salvage value and any insurance or other reimbursement. Then add up all those amounts and subtract 10% of your adjusted gross income from that total to calculate your allowable casualty and theft losses for the year.\u201d\n\nThe 10% rule is by far the biggest obstacle. IRS Publication 547 offers examples of how these limits work.\n\n\u2022 Generally, you can deduct losses only for the year in which they actually occurred. But there is a major exception to that rule that may catch many people by surprise.\n\nIf you suffer a loss occurring in a federally declared disaster area, you can deduct it either on your return for the year in which it happened\u2014or on the return for the preceding tax year, says Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting U.S. (A list of federally declared disasters is at fema.gov).\n\nHere is an example: Suppose you have a casualty loss during 2015 in a place later designated as a federal disaster area. You could deduct it either on your return for 2015 or 2014, Mr. Luscombe says. If you have already filed your return for 2014, consider redoing it\u2014or, in tax-geek language, \u201camending\u201d it\u2014on Form 1040X in order to take advantage of this little-known provision. Or you could wait until you file your return for 2015 during 2016. Figuring out the best option can be complex, especially if you have major questions about what your income or deductions will be for this year.\n\n\u2022 Keep good records, including photos, videos or anything else in order to document what happened and the impact. \u201cIt\u2019s all about keeping those good records,\u201d says Ms. Saks.\n\n\u2022 Report your casualty and theft losses on IRS Form 4684. See the instructions to that form and IRS Tax Topic 515 and Publication 547 for more details.\n\nIf you don\u2019t qualify to deduct anything, you have lots of company. According to the IRS, only about 160,000 returns reported casualty or theft losses for 2012.\n\n***\n\nIf I turned 65 in March 2015, and file my 2014 taxes after that, can I use the standard deduction for 65 or older?\n\nD.H., Round Rock, Texas\n\nNo. You are eligible for the basic standard deduction amount on your federal income-tax return for 2014. You can\u2019t claim the additional amount for those 65 or over until you file your return for 2015, next year.\n\nSome background:\n\nAbout two-thirds of all federal income-tax returns typically claim the standard deduction, which is a dollar amount that reduces your taxable income. They choose that instead of \u201citemizing,\u201d which means listing deductions (such as charitable donations, medical expenses, taxes you paid, and mortgage interest) on Schedule A.\n\nThe basic standard deduction amount depends on your filing status (such as single or married filing jointly). Then there is a higher amount for taxpayers who are 65 or older, or blind. As the IRS explains it: \u201cIf you are age 65 or older on the last day of the year and do not itemize deductions, you are entitled to a higher standard deduction. You are considered 65 on the day before your 65th birthday. Therefore, you can take a higher standard deduction for 2014 if you were born before January 2, 1950.\u201d\n\nFor 2014, the basic standard deduction is $12,400 for married couples filing jointly and $6,200 for most singles as well as those who are married but filing separately. It\u2019s $9,100 for someone who qualifies as \u201chead of household.\u201d\n\nA single person who was 65 or older last year typically could take a total standard deduction of $7,750, according to IRS Publication 17. A married couple, with one spouse 65 or over, could claim a total of $13,600. If both were 65 or over, the deduction would be $14,800.\n\nMr. Herman is a writer in New York City.

Photo: Getty Images\n\nYes, winter is here. But that\u2019s no reason to stay inside for exercise.\n\nFitness experts and researchers are finding that outdoor workouts in cold weather offer unexpected benefits. For instance, increasing your exposure to sunlight may help fend off seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, a type of depression linked to the change in seasons. From a practical standpoint, parks, trails and greenways are less populated in colder months, while gyms and athletic clubs get even more crowded.\n\nA recent study from the University of Tampere in Finland found that working out in nature leads to greater emotional well-being and better sleep than exercising indoors\u2014and that\u2019s no less true in winter than in spring, summer or fall.\n\n\u2018A Walk in the Park\u2019\n\n\u201cGoing for a walk in the park after a fresh snowfall is one of the most exhilarating, stress-reducing things I can think of,\u201d says Wojtek J. Chodzko-Zajko, head of the department of kinesiology and community health at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He runs three miles to work and back each day, no matter the season.\n\nThe caveats: Diabetes, heart or vascular problems can make a person more susceptible to the dangers of the cold. People with diabetes should wear extra protection on the hands and feet to avoid frostbite and check their blood glucose before and after exercise. Those with cardiac problems risk an increase in angina and even a heart attack if they aren\u2019t used to exerting themselves outdoors. People with these conditions should get a doctor\u2019s approval before exercising outside in winter.\n\nAnd of course, stay inside when it\u2019s bitterly cold.\n\nGetting Ready\n\nWondering how to work out safely and comfortably in chilly weather? Here are some tips:\n\nDress the part. \u201cIt\u2019s all about layering,\u201d says Michael Bracko, an exercise physiologist in Calgary, Alberta, and a cold-weather-exercise enthusiast. Start with a base layer of synthetic material or a wool-synthetic blend (no cotton), which wicks moisture away from the body, thus preventing chill. (Damp garments draw heat away from your body.) Wear a middle layer of fleece or wool to act as insulation, and a breathable outer shell made of wind- and water-resistant material.\n\n\u201cA common mistake is wearing too many clothes or wearing an outer layer that\u2019s too heavy,\u201d Mr. Bracko says.\n\nRemember that extremities are particularly vulnerable to cold. \u201cNothing is worse than having cold hands and feet,\u201d Mr. Bracko says. Look for wool-synthetic blend socks and synthetic glove liners.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget a hat, as much of the body\u2019s heat can be lost from an uncovered head. Some outdoor athletes use a full-head covering, such as a balaclava.\n\nFinally, wear all-weather shoes with good traction.\n\nWarm up inside. You\u2019ll be more comfortable when you first step outdoors if you do your warm-up before you leave the house.\n\nBeware the sun. This risk is frequently overlooked in winter workouts. Use sunscreen if sunlight is bright or reflecting off snow, and wear sunglasses to guard against glare.\n\nDrink up. People experience less thirst when it\u2019s cold, Mr. Bracko says. But despite that, they actually have a greater need for hydration, because when the body warms the cold air they inhale, it creates a water vapor that\u2019s released when they exhale.\n\nBe sure to drink liquids at room temperature; ice-cold beverages can chill you.\n\nMs. Howard is a writer in North Carolina.

Photo: Getty Images\n\nKen Pyburn spent four years in a recreational vehicle looking for the perfect place to live before settling on Portland, Ore., in 2010.\n\nAfter visiting \u201cin person or on the Internet\u201d 126 cities and five Canadian provinces, the retired IBM executive and self-described advocate of \u201caging passionately\u201d determined that no flawless city exists. Portland, however, has \u201cmore stuff happening that feeds my soul,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat does Portland\u2014a renowned beer, biking and food-cart mecca for young creatives with and without work\u2014have going to feed the soul of the 50-plus crowd?\n\nPortland is a temperate-climate riverside city of 600,000 halfway between the Pacific coast and the Cascade Mountains. Summers are dry and pleasant. According to local meteorologist Rod Hill, winters in recent years haven\u2019t been as wet or gray as in the past, though springs have been more rainy.\n\nRestaurant scene\n\nBon App\u00e9tit\u2019s restaurant editor calls Portland\u2019s culinary scene \u201ca Europe away from New York,\u201d with food reasonably priced. Music and theater, too, are affordable and ubiquitous. Free Shakespeare is performed under the shade of Douglas firs in the city\u2019s many parks.\n\nThe downsides? Paradise costs. Housing is expensive, and property taxes can be high, depending on your reference point. (This is due, in part, to residents\u2019 generosity: They vote \u201cyes\u201d to most special school, park, library and cultural taxes.)\n\nThe city is low on racial diversity (76% of residents are white), and retirees who want to make some money working part time find themselves competing with hordes of young job seekers.\n\nStill, retirees like Mr. Pyburn are contributing to a projected 106% growth in the number of people 65 and older living in the metro area between 2010 and 2030, according to the 2013 Action Plan for an Age-Friendly Portland.\n\nJan Molinaro, 66, a retired teacher from Evanston, Ill., says she and her husband have found in the city a \u201cculture of kindness.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople acknowledge my presence here,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I look lost downtown, they stop and ask if I need help. On the street and in the stores people smile at you and greet you. I am struck by this. They seem happy to be here.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve seen the same thing. Looking for a change, I moved here three years ago with my fellow baby-boomer husband from Washington, D.C. In so doing, I joined the two-thirds of adults living in Portland who came from out of state. I work part-time from our 1924 bungalow home, grow flowers in a city of lush gardens and two-wheel it for groceries.\n\nFor those seeking Big Nature, as I was, Portland has the nation\u2019s largest urban forested park, lying minutes uphill from downtown. For not-so-intrepid hikers, a guidebook with \u201ccreaky knees\u201d in its title makes the plethora of outdoor opportunities at the nearby coast, Mount Hood and the waterfall-laden Columbia Gorge less intimidating. Wine country lies just outside the city.\n\nNostalgia, Portland\u2019s unstated religion, is driven by people too young to recall the eras they honor. It has given birth to vaudeville acts and jazz bands performing in vintage theaters that have been renovated but not overly so. The live 6 p.m. show (cost: $5) at a Masonic temple turned nightclub pulls in three generations of families to swing dance. The restored 1905 Oaks Amusement Park by the river bustles all summer. Portland is militantly kid-friendly, making it a great place to entertain visiting grandchildren.\n\nWalkable city\n\nThen there\u2019s the compactness. An \u201curban growth boundary\u201d\u2014in place since the late 1970s and used by city planners to curb sprawl\u2014enhances walkability and makes nothing in Portland more than a 20-minute drive.\n\n\u201cThe walkability factor in my neighborhood is a big deal, as I get more exercise and develop relationships with local business owners,\u201d says Ms. Molinaro, the retired teacher. Three times a week, she strolls to her branch of the Multnomah County Library, which has the second-highest circulation in the country (after New York\u2019s public library).\n\nThe city\u2019s college-town vibe is fueled by young artists and actual students. Portland has more than a dozen universities (counting regular four-year institutions such as Reed College, Lewis and Clark College and the University of Portland, plus Oregon Health and Science University, a few Chinese medicine colleges and several art schools). The largest campus is Portland State University. Its Senior Adult Learning Center offers free auditing of courses for Oregon residents 65 and older.\n\nOf course, transplants must first find a home\u2014and the search can be taxing. Portland\u2019s contemporary condos and its many older craftsman homes range from $300,000 to well over $1 million, says local real-estate agent Jennifer Kitch. \u201cYou can still find the occasional bargain in some of the funkier, up-and-coming east-side communities,\u201d she says, \u201cbut they are becoming increasingly rare.\u201d\n\nNew arrivals can find plenty of meaningful work\u2014as long as getting paid isn\u2019t a priority. In 2014, Portland had 3,410 registered charitable benefit organizations, or 501c(3)s, according to Jim White, executive director of the Nonprofit Association of Oregon. A more salient statistic: In 2013, Portland ranked No. 6 among 51 of the nation\u2019s largest cities in its volunteerism rate, according to the Corporation for National and Community Service. More than 33% of Portland residents volunteered in 2013. That compared with No. 1-rated Minneapolis-St. Paul at 35.8%, and No. 51-rated Miami at 14.3%.\n\nThat willingness to pitch in is accompanied by a robust civic engagement. When the Molinaros used to visit Portland from Illinois, they loved watching the sunset from Vista Bridge in a tony section of southwest Portland across the river from their current neighborhood. The 1920s structure, nicknamed Suicide Bridge, is now lined on both sides by a city-imposed chain-link fence to keep people from jumping from it, even though most local residents were opposed to the arrangement, Mr. Molinaro says.\n\nAs an architect, he was appalled by the fence and started attending citizen meetings to discuss replacing it with something more historically appropriate. He joined a group that persuaded Steve Novick, city commissioner, to form the Vista Bridge Restoration Committee, of which Mr. Molinaro is a member. The group eventually produced a report for the city, recommending alternative solutions to the chain-link fence and next steps.\n\n\u201cWe got the city to agree the fence is temporary. They will eventually take it down,\u201d Mr. Molinaro says. That experience, he adds, stands in contrast with his years in Illinois. Portland\u2019s neighborhoods, he explains, \u201chave a much stronger say in their future.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of a series in which people age 50-plus profile their adopted locales.

He also advises against certain destinations for those at higher risk, such as a 70-year-old with a pacemaker.\n\n\u201cI tell people about once or twice a month\u2014when their heart is set on doing something\u2014that it isn\u2019t safe for you to go for health reasons.\u201d Rather than trekking around Madagascar, for example, he might recommend a cruise.\n\nOverseas hospitals or clinics may not always be prepared for the highest level of care, and patients can get caught up in red tape or language barriers. It\u2019s advisable to check if your health plan covers overseas medical treatment, and purchase additional coverage if not. Some companies provide on-the-spot medical care and transport from the point of illness or injury, back to the U.S. if necessary.\n\nRobert Talley, a 68-year-old dentist from Norman, Okla., and his wife, Pamela, have been active travelers for years; trips have included mountain climbing and hunting in Africa. Dr. Talley says he never had a problem\u2014until a trip to Turkey in December. While on a domestic flight there, he suffered an irregular heartbeat and other symptoms. After landing in Antalya, he was taken to a local emergency room, diagnosed with a type of stroke and told he would need to be hospitalized for two weeks.\n\nDr. Talley is a member of Global Rescue, a Boston-based company that provides travel risk, crisis management and evacuation services for companies and individual travelers, and partners with Johns Hopkins Medicine for medical consultations. Pamela Talley contacted the company the day after Robert was hospitalized; Global Rescue, in turn, contacted the hospital for copies of diagnostic scans and doctors\u2019 recommendations. When some of its requests weren\u2019t met, the company sent a critical-care paramedic to Antalya to coordinate care and get copies of the tests for review by cardiologists in the U.S.\n\nA Turkish doctor wanted to keep Dr. Talley in the country for several weeks and then implant a pacemaker, but Dr. Talley wanted to return home. U.S. doctors felt he would be safe flying to the U.S. on a commercial flight in business class. A Global Rescue staffer coordinated his release and accompanied him on the four legs of the flight home, assisting with details and monitoring medications. He also arranged for transportation and admission to Baylor Heart and Vascular Hospital in Dallas, where doctors decided a pacemaker wasn\u2019t appropriate and implanted a heart-rhythm monitor that can be read remotely, according to Dr. Talley.\n\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t know when that freak event is going to happen,\u201d says Dr. Talley, who adds that he plans to return to Turkey.\n\nGlobal Rescue memberships, based on trip length and the extent of services, start at $119 for a seven-day trip. (Destination isn\u2019t a factor in pricing.) Annual memberships start at $329 for an individual and $579 for a family, with additional fees for security memberships that cover nonmedical emergencies such as natural disasters, terrorism and geopolitical instability. After the Nepal earthquake, the company had 125 requests for help from members, including some on mountain-climbing expeditions, according to chief executive officer Dan Richards.\n\nMembers can access an app, the Global Rescue Grid, searching by country for risk ratings based on both security and health.\n\nOther companies offering travel evacuation and medical-assistance services include MedjetAssist and Medex, and insurance companies also offer various options.\n\nWhile traveling in Turkey, Robert Talley, with his wife, Pamela, had symptoms that turned out to be a type of stroke. Photo: Robert Talley\n\nGetting informed\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department offer free travel websites and apps to help travelers assess health and security risks. The CDC\u2019s TravWell, aimed at consumers, includes destination-specific recommendations, checklists and packing lists. (For those worried mostly about adventurous eating, it also has an app that lets users search for health risks by country and food type, called Can I Eat This?) CDC\u2019s Health Information for International Travel\u2014also known as the Yellow Book (because of the color of its cover)\u2014is primarily aimed at health professionals who advise patients about travel risks, but it can also help consumers.\n\nThe State Department offers Smart Traveler, an app with frequently updated country information, travel alerts, warnings, maps and U.S. embassy locations. It also provides access to the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program, a free service that enables U.S. citizens and nationals traveling abroad to enroll their trip with the nearest embassy or consulate, get information about safety conditions, help the embassy contact them in an emergency, or assist friends and family in getting in touch.\n\n\u201cYou have to be prepared for anything when you travel,\u201d says Paul Auerbach, a professor of surgery at Stanford University School of Medicine who edits a textbook on wilderness medicine and a packable paperback guide, \u201cMedicine for the Outdoors,\u201d which includes advice on dealing with natural calamities such as typhoons, earthquakes and tsunamis.\n\nDr. Auerbach, who recently returned from providing medical aid to locals in Nepal, offers some nonmedical advice as well: Always have extra copies of your passport stashed in different locations, keep important medications close, and carry an extra power supply to give your cell phone an extra charge should you not have access to electricity.\n\nMs. Landro is a Wall Street Journal assistant managing editor in New York and writes the Informed Patient column.

Photo: Getty.\n\nEveryone knows that as we age, our minds and bodies decline\u2014and life inevitably becomes less satisfying and enjoyable.\n\nEveryone knows that cognitive decline is inevitable.\n\nEveryone knows that as we get older, we become less productive at work.\n\nEveryone, it seems, is wrong.\n\nStephen Webster\n\nContrary to the stereotype of later life as a time of loneliness, depression and decline, a growing body of scientific research shows that, in many ways, life gets better as we get older.\n\n\u201cThe story used to be that satisfaction with life went downhill, but the remarkable thing that researchers are finding is that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case,\u201d says Timothy Salthouse, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia.\n\nIn fact, a growing body of evidence indicates that our moods and overall sense of well-being improve with age. Friendships tend to grow more intimate, too, as older adults prioritize what matters most to them, says Karen Fingerman, a professor of human development and family sciences at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nOther academics have found that knowledge and certain types of intelligence continue to develop in ways that can even offset age-related declines in the brain\u2019s ability to process new information and reason abstractly. Expertise deepens, which can enhance productivity and creativity. Some go so far as to say that wisdom\u2014defined, in part, as the ability to resolve conflicts by seeing problems from multiple perspectives\u2014flourishes.\n\nTo be sure, growing older has its share of challenges. Some people don\u2019t age as well as others. And especially at advanced ages, chronic conditions including diabetes, hypertension and dementia become increasingly common and can take a toll on mental, as well as physical, health.\n\nStill, those who fall into the \u201cstereotype of being depressed, cranky, irritable and obsessed with their alimentary canal\u201d constitute \u201cno more than 10% of the older population,\u201d says Paul Costa, a scientist emeritus at the National Institutes of Health, who for more than three decades directed the personality program of the long-running Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. \u201cThe other 90% of the population isn\u2019t like that at all,\u201d Dr. Costa says.\n\nHere are six prevalent myths about aging\u2014along with recent research that dispels common misconceptions.\n\nMyth No. 1: Depression Is More Prevalent in Old Age\n\nIt\u2019s easy to assume that old age would be a depressing time of life. After all, as health declines and friends and relatives become disabled and die, it can be hard to maintain a positive outlook.\n\nBut research indicates that emotional well-being improves until the 70s, when it levels off. Even centenarians \u201creport overall high levels of well-being,\u201d according to a 2014 study by researchers including Laura Carstensen, director of Stanford University\u2019s Center on Longevity, which cites a 2006 study by Christoph Rott, a senior research scientist at Heidelberg University in Germany, among others.\n\nHow do researchers measure well-being? From 1993 to 1995, Stanford scientists distributed beepers to 184 adults, ages 18 to 94. For one week, at five randomly selected times each day, the researchers paged participants, who filled out questionnaires asking them to assess\u2014on a scale of one to seven\u2014how much they felt of 19 emotions, including anger, sadness, amusement, boredom and joy. The researchers repeated the same exercise five and 10 years later.\n\nTheir conclusion: As the participants aged, their moods\u2014measured by the ratio of positive to negative emotions\u2014steadily improved.\n\n\u201cContrary to the popular view that youth is the best time of life, the peak of emotional life may not occur until well into the seventh decade,\u201d Prof. Carstensen says.\n\nThe study joins others that conclude that older adults focus on positive rather than negative emotions, memories and stimuli. In a 2003 study, for example, Prof. Carstensen found that in contrast to younger adults, older adults presented with an array of happy, sad and angry faces directed their gazes more often toward the happy ones.\n\nWhy the focus on the positive? As people age, they tend to prioritize emotional meaning and satisfaction, giving them an incentive to see the good more than the bad, Prof. Carstensen says.\n\nNational data back up the findings. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, 5.5% of adults age 50 and over said they experienced a major depressive episode in 2012. For those 26 to 49, the rate was 7.6%, and for ages 18 to 25 it was 8.9%.\n\nWhile rates of depression in nursing homes tend to be high, Prof. Fingerman says, \u201cIn general, when we look at older adults, they tend to be happier, less anxious, less angry and tend to adapt well to their circumstances.\u201d\n\nMyth No. 2: Cognitive Decline Is Inevitable\n\nAs we age, our brains undergo structural changes. Certain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, shrink. And the neurons that carry messages become less efficient. As a result, concentration and memory slip and, around age 30, scores on tests of abstract reasoning and novel problem-solving begin to decline.\n\nLike an older computer, an older brain typically takes longer to process and retrieve information from its crowded memory, says Denise Park, a professor of behavioral and brain sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas.\n\nBut recent discoveries also indicate that\u2014barring dementia\u2014older adults perform better in the real world than they do on cognitive tests. \u201cTypical laboratory tasks may systematically underestimate the true abilities of older adults,\u201d says Lynn Hasher, a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto and a senior scientist at the Rotman Research Institute.\n\nTo test raw intellectual prowess, scientists design experiments that \u201cminimize the influence of past experience\u201d on performance, says Prof. Salthouse in Virginia. The experiments \u201ctell us what people can do in artificial situations,\u201d he says. But in the real world, \u201cmost of what we do is based on the knowledge we have acquired.\u201d Because knowledge and experience increase with age, older adults who are tested in familiar situations show few of the deficits that crop up in laboratory tests, he says.\n\nYounger adults may also have advantages in laboratory tests that have nothing to do with their cognitive skills. For example, because professors often recruit students for their experiments, some younger participants may be more comfortable in a lab than older participants, says Prof. Hasher.\n\nOlder adults who believe negative stereotypes about aging can also unwittingly undermine their own performance on memory tests. In a study published in 2012, scientists at the Yale School of Public Health and the National Institute on Aging reviewed memory tests administered to 395 older participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, all of whom\u2014at younger ages\u2014had filled out questionnaires assessing their beliefs in negative stereotypes about aging. Over a 38-year period, the decline in memory performance for those ages 60 and over with more negative stereotypes was 30% greater than for those with less negative views, says Becca Levy, an author of the study and an associate professor of psychology at the Yale School of Public Health.\n\nThe good news: Recent experiments show that certain activities appear to enhance cognitive function and perhaps slow age-related cognitive declines. In two studies published earlier this year, Prof. Park in Dallas tested the memories of 239 adults ages 60 to 90, about one-half of whom spent about 16 hours a week over three months learning new skills, including how to quilt, use an iPad and take digital photographs.\n\nCompared with peers who performed word puzzles or engaged in social activities and other tasks that required no new skills, those learning new skills \u201cshowed greater improvements in memory, with some also showing improvement in processing speed,\u201d says Prof. Park, who believes that older adults who learn challenging new skills tap more diffuse brain circuits and pathways to compensate for age-related deficits.\n\n\u201cNovelty combined with mental challenge is very important,\u201d she says. \u201cGet out of your comfort zone.\u201d\n\nSome scientists also believe older adults can make wiser decisions. In a study published in 2010, scientists asked 247 Midwesterners to read stories about conflicts between individuals and social groups and predict the outcomes. After transcribing their responses, the investigators removed participants\u2019 names and ages and asked students who had received training to rate their responses on the basis of \u201cwisdom\u201d\u2014defined, in part, as the ability to see problems from multiple perspectives and show sensitivity to social relationships. The researchers then asked outside experts\u2014including clergy and professional counselors\u2014to rank a subset of the responses according to their own definitions of wisdom, a process that largely confirmed the accuracy of the students\u2019 ratings.\n\nThe average age of those with scores in the top 20% was 65, versus 46 for the remaining 80%, says Igor Grossmann, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Waterloo in Ontario.\n\nMyth No. 3: Older Workers Are Less Productive\n\nWorkers 55 or older make up 22% of the U.S. labor force, up from 12% in 1992. But thanks in part to stereotypes that portray older workers as less adaptable than their younger colleagues, they are widely assumed to be less productive.\n\nIn fact, the vast majority of academic studies shows \u201cvirtually no relationship between age and job performance,\u201d says Harvey Sterns, director of the Institute for Life-Span Development and Gerontology at the University of Akron.\n\nIn jobs that require experience, some studies show that older adults have a performance edge. Economists at the Max Planck Institute for Social Law and Social Policy, a nonprofit research organization in Munich, examined the number and severity of errors 3,800 workers made on a Mercedes-Benz assembly line from 2003 to 2006. The economists determined that over that four-year period, the older workers committed slightly fewer severe errors, while the younger workers\u2019 severe error rates edged up.\n\n\u201cThe older workers seemed to know better how to avoid severe errors,\u201d says Matthias Weiss, the academic coordinator at the institute.\n\nMyth No. 4: Loneliness Is More Likely\n\nAs people age, their social circles contract. But that doesn\u2019t mean older adults are lonely.\n\nIn fact, several academic studies indicate that friendships tend to improve with age.\n\n\u201cOlder adults typically report better marriages, more supportive friendships, less conflict with children and siblings and closer ties with members of their social networks than younger adults,\u201d says Prof. Fingerman, co-author of a 2004 study that found older adults have \u201ca higher rate of close ties than younger people\u201d and fewer \u201cproblematic relationships that cause them distress.\u201d\n\nThat is also the message of research that Prof. Carstensen published this year. The researchers asked 184 people they have followed for more than a decade to put their friends and relatives into three categories: an inner circle, consisting of people they \u201cfeel so close [to] that it would be hard to imagine life without them\u201d; a middle circle they feel a little less close to \u201cbut who are still very important\u201d; and an outer circle. The researchers also asked the participants every couple of years to rate\u2014on a scale of one to seven\u2014the intensity of the positive and negative emotions they felt for each.\n\nThe findings: Until about age 50, most people add to their social networks. After that, they eliminate people they feel less close to and maximize interactions with \u201cclose partners who are more emotionally satisfying,\u201d says Prof. Carstensen.\n\nOver time, the participants also assigned their networks more positive ratings. \u201cTheir loved ones seem to mean more than ever, and that is protective against loneliness,\u201d says Prof. Carstensen. While this doesn\u2019t mean loneliness isn\u2019t a problem for some older people, she adds, research indicates that, on average, older adults are less lonely than young people.\n\nMyth No. 5: Creativity Declines With Age\n\nCreativity has long been seen as the province of the young. (Think: Lennon and McCartney, Jobs and Wozniak.)\n\nBut academic studies that date as far back as the 19th century pinpoint midlife as the time when artists and scholars are most prolific. Dean Keith Simonton, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Davis, says creativity tends to peak earlier in fields such as pure mathematics and theoretical physics, where breakthroughs typically hinge on problem-solving skills that are sharpest in one\u2019s 20s. In fields that require accumulated knowledge, creative peaks typically occur later. Historians and philosophers, for example, \u201cmay reach their peak output when they are in their 60s,\u201d he says.\n\nIn recent years, an economist has put forth a theory of creative late bloomers. David Galenson, a professor at the University of Chicago, analyzed the ages at which some 300 famous artists, poets and novelists produced their most valuable works. (For the artwork, he used auction prices and the number of times specific works appeared in text books. For literary works, he counted the words devoted to them in scholarly monographs.)\n\nHis conclusion: Creative genius clusters into two categories: conceptual artists, who tend to do their best work in their 20s and 30s, and experimental artists, who often need a few more decades to reach full potential. Conceptual artists work from imagination, an area where the young have an advantage because they tend to be more open to radical new ideas, Prof. Galenson says. Experimental artists improve with experience. They take years to perfect their style and knowledge of their subjects.\n\nPeople who are creative in older age aren\u2019t anomalies, he says. Mark Twain, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Frank Lloyd Wright, Robert Frost and Virginia Woolf are just a few of the artists \u201cwho did their greatest work in their 40s, 50s and 60s. These artists rely on wisdom, which increases with age.\u201d\n\nMyth No. 6: More Exercise Is Better\n\nWhen it comes to improving health and longevity, exercise is key. But a growing number of studies show that more exercise may not always be better.\n\n\u201cYou get to a point of diminishing returns,\u201d says James O\u2019Keefe, a professor of medicine at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.\n\nIn a study to be published this month, Dr. O\u2019Keefe and co-authors tracked 1,098 joggers and 3,950 non-joggers from 2001 to 2013; all were part of the Copenhagen City Heart Study, under way since 1976. Overall, the runners in the Copenhagen study lived longer than the non-runners: 6.2 years longer for the men, and 5.6 years longer for the women.\n\nBut the new study discovered that those who ran more than four hours a week at a fast pace\u2014of 7 miles per hour or more\u2014lost much, if not all, of the longevity benefits.\n\nThe group that saw the biggest improvements? Those who jogged from one to 2.4 hours weekly at 5 to 7 mph and took at least two days off from vigorous exercise per week.\n\nOther studies have come to similar conclusions. In research published this year, scientists at institutions including Iowa State University found that the death rate for runners is 30% to 45% below that for non-runners. But the mortality benefits were similar for all runners, even those who ran five to 10 minutes a day at speeds of 6 mph or less. \u201cFairly modest doses of running provided benefits as great as\u2026a lot of running,\u201d says Russell Pate, an author of the study and professor at the University of South Carolina.\n\nDr. O\u2019Keefe believes long-term strenuous endurance exercise may cause \u201coveruse injury\u201d to the heart. His recommendation: Stick to a moderate cardiovascular workout of no more than 30 miles a week or 50 to 60 minutes of vigorous exercise a day, and take at least one day off each week. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to run a marathon,\u201d he says.\n\nMs. Tergesen is a Wall Street Journal staff reporter in New York.

Minimal gear is required: a set of dumbbells and hand weights, an exercise ball and resistance bands. Mr. Liebman, who is also a personal trainer, recommends yoga moves and range-of-motion stretches, cardio, resistance and core-strength workouts to build mobility and balance. Detailed instructions and illustrations show how to perform each exercise properly, avoiding strain or injury. For each exercise, the benefits are explained (building endurance or increasing coordination, for instance), the target area revealed (such as back or abdominals) and caveats are issued when a workout isn\u2019t advisable because of a particular condition, weakness or injury. He provides the tools to customize workouts to fit your particular goals. His training mantra: It\u2019s never too late to start\u2014and it\u2019s never too early, either.\n\nLife lessons\n\nIn his new book, \u201cNine Essential Things I\u2019ve Learned About Life,\u201d best-selling author Harold S. Kushner, author of \u201cWhen Bad Things Happen to Good People,\u201d shares more down-to-earth lessons about purpose, conscience, forgiveness and the meaning of faith, especially as we age. \u201cThe task of religion isn\u2019t to teach us to bow our heads and accept God\u2019s inscrutable will,\u201d writes the esteemed rabbi. \u201cIt is to help us find the resources to live meaningfully and to go on believing, even in a world where people often don\u2019t get what they deserve.\u201d In other words, he writes, \u201creligion can teach us not to despair.\u201d Whatever one\u2019s religious beliefs may be, Mr. Kushner has much to say about the enduring value of community, the universal need for a sense of belonging, the moral sense that makes us human and the ways in which we also help ourselves by helping others.\n\nTransition planning\u2014and living\n\nCharting a transition to retirement can be easier with the practical advice found in \u201cHappy Retirement: The Psychology of Reinvention,\u201d by Kenneth S. Shultz with Megan Kaye and Mike Annesley. The book\u2019s big-picture perspective takes in all aspects of what goes into choosing what comes next, from work and money to values, interests, skills, talents and aspirations. Emphasizing thoughtful decision-making based on self-assessment and solid information, the book encompasses the years before, during and after retirement. Topics covered include how to translate dreams into goals, and how to regroup if those plans go awry; how to identify and possibly re-create valued aspects of work (such as colleagues or mentoring); how to boldly venture forward; and how to just plain enjoy the next phase of life.\n\nNight reading\n\nKent Haruf\u2019s spare and elegant novel, \u201cOur Souls at Night,\u201d was one of the best of the year for any age\u2014but men and women entering new life phases will particularly savor the game courage and dry wit with which its two main characters take an unlikely bet on happiness and stubbornly follow through.

That\u2019s what you think.\n\nResearch shows that high-intensity interval training\u2014brief bursts of activity followed by short rests or recovery periods of low-intensity activity\u2014often yields greater benefits, in less time, than a conventional, moderately paced workout.\n\n\u201cYou can get away with doing less interval training compared with a continuous workout,\u201d says Jonathan P. Little, assistant professor in the school of health and exercise sciences at the University of British Columbia. \u201cThere\u2019s more bang for your buck.\u201d\n\nFor many people who don\u2019t have the time\u2014or the patience\u2014for a long workout, the findings will be welcome news. In addition, knowing the benefits of high-intensity interval training, or HIIT, could make it easier to stick with an exercise regimen. A special attraction for older exercisers: The training may be better than noninterval aerobic exercise for chronic conditions that tend to afflict older people, such as heart disease, diabetes and pulmonary disease.\n\nHIIT forces the heart and lungs to work harder in the \u201csprint\u201d mode than they would in a typical workout, which leads to greater gains in aerobic capacity. The approach causes more blood to flow through the body, making blood vessels particularly elastic, and requires work from more of your muscles.\n\n\u201cWhen you go out for an easy walk, you call upon about 50% to 60% of your muscle fibers,\u201d Dr. Little says. \u201cTo do the work at a quicker pace calls upon 80% to 100% of your muscle fibers.\u201d\n\nThe interval approach is popular among young elite athletes who want to improve their performance, but other people are beginning to see benefits. Much of the data involves people over 50 years of age, who stand to reap more of its benefits; after 50, people start losing muscle mass, especially the fast-twitch fibers that enable everyday activities like climbing stairs or recovering from a stumble. HIIT may be particularly appealing to those who have never logged miles on a treadmill or counted laps in a pool.\n\nIn a study by researchers at Abertay University in Dundee, Scotland, just two weekly sessions of a HIIT workout helped lower blood pressure an average of 9% in a group of people over age 60. The workout consisted of all-out pedaling on an exercise bike for six seconds, followed by a few minutes of rest, for up to 10 cycles per workout.\n\nAs participants did these workouts over the six-week study period, they also found day-to-day activities easier to perform. \u201cThey felt more physically capable and felt that they had more energy to do things,\u201d says study author John Brabraj, a lecturer in sports and exercise science at Abertay.\n\nHIIT workouts may also improve insulin sensitivity, studies show. In research from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, a group of people 50 and up with metabolic syndrome, often a precursor to diabetes, were assigned to a high-intensity workout on a treadmill or a longer, continuous workout. At the end of the study, 46% of subjects doing the high-intensity workout no longer met the criteria for metabolic syndrome, versus 37% of those who did conventional workouts.\n\nInterval training may be better than noninterval aerobic exercise for chronic conditions that tend to afflict older people. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nA pilot study from the Montreal Heart Institute suggests that HIIT workouts may also boost cognition, according to lead investigator Anil Nigam, the institute\u2019s director of the Research Program in Preventive Cardiology. Scores on tests of cognitive function, such as the ability to remember pairs of numbers and symbols, significantly improved among a group of obese individuals in their 40s and 50s who underwent the training.\n\nPeople who are already exercising can safely incorporate the principle into their usual workout by alternating between short intervals of hard effort and longer recovery intervals, Dr. Little says. If you walk, jog or cycle, for instance, just pick up the pace for 30 to 60 seconds, then exercise normally for the same amount of time, repeating the cycle four to 10 times. Practice the routine three times a week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like \u2018The Biggest Loser\u2019 type of exercise,\u201d Dr. Little says, referring to the reality-TV series. \u201cYou\u2019re getting out of your comfort zone, but for no more than a minute each interval.\u201d\n\nMs. Howard is a writer in Charlotte, N.C.

Photo: University of Washington Medical Center\n\nAfter a hospital stay, patients may just want to put the experience behind them. The last thing they want to do is come back.\n\nIncreasingly, though, they are doing just that\u2014but at the request of the hospital, and in an effort to improve care. They are being recruited for patient and family advisory councils to work on projects and policies along with hospital staff, weighing in on matters ranging from the design of hospital rooms to improving communication with nurses, and even tagging along with doctors on their rounds.\n\nAs a hospital volunteer opportunity, advisory councils go far beyond the traditional role of handing out magazines and manning an information booth, and can require a significant time commitment. But former patients who have taken on the challenge say it helps them advocate for other patients and families in a way they could never do otherwise.\n\nFor hospitals, the councils are an integral part of a strategy known as patient and family engagement. Councils were rare in hospitals a decade ago, but a survey published in the journal BMJ Safety and Quality earlier this year found that about 38% of hospitals surveyed had the panels.\n\nGreater satisfaction\n\nThe survey, conducted by the nonprofit Health Research and Educational Trust and funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, also indicated that hospitals with patient and family advisory councils had a higher percentage of patients rating a hospital a 9 or 10 out of a possible 10 on patient satisfaction surveys than at hospitals without councils. Medicare uses the surveys in setting some payments to hospitals.\n\nTo join a council, patients and families can let doctors or nurses they deal with know of their interest; many hospitals rely on staff to identify patients and family members who would be good candidates. Often they ask patients who have had a difficult experience, expressed complaints or offered suggestions on how things could be improved.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for people who have thoughtful feedback and are ready to move forward, rather than someone who is super-angry with us,\u201d says Cindy Sayre, an associate administrator at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle.\n\nThe hospital has several councils that have already helped make significant changes. In the past, the intensive-care unit was less than welcoming, keeping families out of the unit and locking the doors at night, says Keri Nasenbeny, assistant administrator for critical care. A patient and family council formed in 2008 has helped provide open access to families around the clock, dropping a requirement to call before visiting and adding amenities such as iPads, sleeper chairs and phone chargers for families.\n\nPaul Lifschultz, 61, started treatment at the University of Washington for acute lymphocytic leukemia in 2010, which involved four or five days in the hospital almost monthly for six months. After two years of maintenance chemotherapy he was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome, requiring a bone-marrow transplant in 2013. Though the care was excellent, and he credits the hospital with saving his life twice, there were issues that irked him, such as the fact that doctors rarely engaged patients and families when they were on their rounds and nurses rarely communicated during shift changes.\n\nMr. Lifschultz, says that as a patient, he was always chatting with staff members and curious about what was going on at the hospital. He was asked to join an inpatient advisory council in 2011. Since then, he has served on various councils and committees, helping to rewrite patient handbooks and make the wording on signs clearer, and considering issues as diverse as architectural-design projects, the way letters of condolence are written and how the billing department communicates.\n\nAmong his favorite roles is attending bedside rounds with doctors, who under new hospital policies go into patient rooms with other staffers and talk directly to the patients and their families. He sometimes acts as a \u201csecret shopper\u201d on rounds, taking note of whether a pharmacist was present to discuss medication issues and whether doctors had taken a family\u2019s input about a patient into account. He often talks to patients himself, telling them he has been in their shoes \u201cand trying to make them more comfortable and confident in their treatment.\u201d\n\nMr. Lifschultz is back to work in strategic development at a food marketing and distribution company, but spends about 16 hours a month at the hospital, often getting up at 5:30 a.m. to be there at 7 for meetings and rounds before work. He loves his day job, he says, but \u201cbeing at the hospital gives me emotional and psychic rewards. \u201cI\u2019ve found the providers to be incredibly receptive to the council members\u2019 opinions and am grateful for being allowed to participate in the process.\u201d\n\nNational council\n\nLifePoint Health, which operates about 70 hospitals in 22 states, created a national family advisory board last year with seven family members and six staff members. Rusty Holman, LifePoint\u2019s chief medical officer, says the national council has focused on such issues as helping local hospitals adopt bedside shift reports, which require nurses to confer at the patient bedside when changing shifts, and the development of a patient portal that connects to electronic medical records and primary-care offices.\n\nAt LifePoint\u2019s Havasu Regional Medical Center in Lake Havasu City, Ariz., the local council has worked on emergency-department discharge education for patients who get higher-risk medicines such as narcotics, and eliminating defined visiting hours, so people can see their hospitalized family members anytime.\n\nAnother advisory council at Conemaugh Medical Center in Johnstown, Pa., is advising on the layout and design of a new hospital building and redesigning the white boards located in patient rooms so that they are more patient- and family-friendly.\n\nSome council members have a particular area of interest. For Amy Buesing, it\u2019s medication safety. A former pharmacist at LifePoint\u2019s Memorial Medical Center of Las Cruces, N.M., she was treated for breast cancer at the hospital and later had a double knee replacement. One goal for her on Memorial\u2019s council is to make sure patients understand their medicines both in the hospital and when they are sent home, and to ensure nurses are well educated about helping patients manage their pain.\n\n\u201cWhen I was diagnosed with breast cancer, one of the first things that popped into my head was that I\u2019m going to find a larger purpose out of this,\u201d Ms. Buesing says. Serving on the advisory council has given her the chance \u201cto influence care and impact patients in a positive way.\u201d\n\nMs. Landro writes the Journal\u2019s Informed Patient column.

When a house is razed, childhood memories can be buried along with the debris. Mark Tergesen\n\nI have managed to navigate most trials in middle age (job changes, children leaving home, deceased pets) with a fair amount of grace. But now I find myself strangely unnerved by an event beyond my control: My childhood home is about to be torn down.\n\nThis summer, my parents sold the 2,000-square-foot split-level they bought in a suburb of New York City in the early 1970s. The buyer, a Bronx-based developer of everything from office complexes to strip malls, plans to demolish the house to make way for something bigger and grander\u2014a five-bedroom McMansion with stainless-steel appliances, custom millwork, surround sound, and a master suite with a marble bathroom and radiant heat.\n\nFor my siblings and me, my parents\u2019 decision to sell provoked mixed emotions. It\u2019s a huge relief to no longer have to worry about anyone tripping on the stairs. But it\u2019s also hard not to feel depressed at the sight of the old homestead\u2014the center of our family life\u2014empty after 43 years.\n\nWhen a neighbor emailed me recently to say my parents\u2019 mail was still being delivered there, I was glad for an excuse to drive over and see the house one last time. But with a large piece of excavating equipment sitting in the driveway, it was impossible to ignore what\u2019s to come.\n\nOut With the Old\n\nI understand why the house is being torn down. The stairs aren\u2019t up to today\u2019s construction codes. The bathrooms and kitchen are small. When someone slams the door in the garage, you can feel the vibrations upstairs in my brother\u2019s old bedroom. The plumbing, windows and electric wiring haven\u2019t been touched in decades. The metallic wallpaper with blue flowers in the bathroom my brother and I once shared says it all: The house is clearly outdated.\n\nStill, I dread its rendezvous with a wrecking ball. When my childhood BFF\u2019s century-old house was bulldozed last spring (goodbye high ceilings and ornate mantelpieces), the teardown trend in our old neighborhood suddenly became personal. Was some nefarious force\u2014McMansion mania? Voldemort?\u2014out to destroy my childhood haunts?\n\nI\u2019m far from alone. Robert Denk, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders, says about 25% of the single-family homes built nationwide this year will rise from the ashes of teardowns.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s buyer doesn\u2019t want grandma\u2019s house,\u201d says Brian Hickey, chief executive of teardowns.com, which helps buyers and sellers of such properties find each other. \u201cBuyer preferences have changed, and many older homes are tough to renovate. The ceilings are too low, the basements are dreary, and the wiring is inadequate for today\u2019s technology.\u201d All of which sounds familiar.\n\nOn teardowns.com\u2019s list of most \u201cactive teardown communities\u201d nationwide, I wasn\u2019t surprised to find my hometown, Rye, N.Y. It\u2019s a densely populated suburb where construction pits abound and the median price of single-family homes listed for sale is $2.8 million, according to Gail Feeney, a broker at Julia B. Fee Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. For that amount of money, I guess I wouldn\u2019t tolerate a dreary basement, either.\n\nA Lost Connection\n\nDoes it really matter that our house will soon be landfill? After all, even if my parents had sold it to the buyer they had hoped for\u2014a family with young children\u2014we would still be losing access to the property.\n\nIrene Goldenberg, a family psychologist and professor emerita at the University of California, Los Angeles, says teardowns can be more traumatic for former owners, and their children, than sales in which a house survives.\n\nFor one thing, she says, it\u2019s hard to escape the finality of a teardown, which makes it all the more obvious \u201cthat you can no longer go back to the safety and comfort\u201d of childhood. \u201cIt\u2019s in your face,\u201d she says.\n\nThere is also an obvious analogy to my aging parents. With new construction springing up all over the neighborhood, the house suddenly looks like a relic of another era. Still, when I came across the property records in my parents\u2019 files last spring, the comparison that immediately sprang to mind was to myself. Although I had always assumed the house was older, it was actually erected just a few years before I was born in 1964.\n\nFor many people, childhood homes function like a psychological safety net, says Gerald Davison, a professor of psychology at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t feel comfortable knocking on the door, it\u2019s nice to know that it\u2019s always possible to do so\u201d and reconnect with childhood, he says.\n\nWhen a house is razed, Dr. Davison says, childhood memories can be buried along with the debris. The experience of tunneling into the past is \u201cmore powerful when all of your senses can take something in,\u201d he says. Sure, photographs are vivid reminders. But being there in person \u201ctriggers even stronger memories\u201d cued by the smells, sounds, and tactile and visual details that can\u2019t be captured in photos, he adds.\n\nHoping for Remnants\n\nI agree that having some physical embodiment of the past would be easier on the psyche. When I recently drove by my first childhood home\u2014where we lived until I was 7 years old\u2014things weren\u2019t exactly as I had remembered. The driveway seems less steep and the backyard, now partially occupied by an addition, is far smaller than it was when my sisters and I spent afternoons in our playhouse.\n\nBut while the shingles are no longer the same shade of white, the facade is otherwise remarkably similar. And the all-important \u201chome base\u201d rock\u2014a fixture in our games of tag and princess in a castle\u2014still sits in the side yard. That house, at least, gives me a quick way to reconnect with the feelings and memories of a time when the world seemed less complicated than it does now.\n\nBefore my parents moved out of the newer house this summer, we joked about burying a time capsule in the backyard as a way of leaving something of ourselves behind. The first item in it, everyone agreed, would be my grandparents\u2019 Norwegian flag. Perhaps, someone suggested, the \u201cTergesen\u201d sign that hung in the family room would fit. My sister suggested a novel my other sister had written as a teenager, a potboiler whose new installments the neighborhood girls eagerly consumed. My sister-in-law volunteered my brother\u2019s baby blanket. We laughed and went back to packing and sorting.\n\nI am hoping the builder will have the good sense to preserve some of the property\u2019s best features, including the stone wall in the backyard and the thick rhododendron bushes in which two deer took shelter during a snowstorm last winter.\n\nBut because it\u2019s hard to get a glimpse of those things from the street, I\u2019m pinning my hopes on the property\u2019s towering oak trees. Assuming they make it through the construction, they\u2019ll be the tokens I rely on to recognize the place as the same one where I grew up.\n\nMs. Tergesen is a staff reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Which makes me, if not uniquely qualified, then at least a freshly minted judge of how useful the many books on the topic really are\u2014and how their tips about downsizing compare with my own experience. Here are the best of the lot.\n\n\u201cThe Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up\u201d and \u201cSpark Joy: An Illustrated Master Class on the Art of Organizing and Tidying Up\u201d by Marie Kondo\n\nThe basic message is the same in both of these volumes: If the item sparks joy, keep it; if not, dump it. The chief organizing principle is the same as well: Sort category by category, not room by room; put all similar items (all your sweaters or suits, for instance) on the floor to get an overview of what you\u2019ve amassed, then let your joy, or lack thereof, guide you.\n\nPhoto: --\n\nThe main difference between the two books is that the sequel is more comprehensive, including tips galore for everything from cleaning out the medicine cabinet to saying goodbye to sentimental knickknacks to the best way to fold bras and store your underwear.\n\nI read Ms. Kondo\u2019s first book in preparation for packing up, and took her basic suggestions to heart. Sorting through categories of stuff rather than focusing on overstuffed rooms was a tremendous help. This was particularly so as I plowed through bedding and linens I had stored in different places. (Of the several hand-knit afghans I had forgotten about, I kept one for myself and let the others spark joy as gifts to family members.) Questioning what emotion each item sparked propelled me through ranks of newly uncovered snow globes, postcards and other long-ago vacation souvenirs.\n\nThere is one untidy matter I wish Ms. Kondo had spent more time addressing in these volumes: the conflict between spouses who disagree on, say, those dozens of extra hangers accumulated through the years. (\u201cBut our guests might need them,\u201d my husband said. \u201cHow many guests are you expecting?\u201d I asked.)\n\nAnd, in the spirit of tidying up, the question has to be asked: Why clutter your bookshelf (or e-reader) with both of these books, when one might suffice? As I went about unpacking in our new apartment, \u201cSpark Joy,\u201d with its very specific closet storage tips, is the one that sparked the most relief for me.\n\n\u201cDownsizing the Family Home: What to Save, What to Let Go\u201d by Marni Jameson\n\nThis is essential reading for anyone clearing out your own or a loved one\u2019s home. Ms. Jameson takes us through the myriad practical lessons she had to learn as she moved her almost 90-year-old parents from their four-bedroom longtime home to a small assisted-living apartment.\n\nPhoto: --\n\nAccompanying each step in her journey are well-researched checklists and suggestions, such as how to cope with the emotional undertow and how to deal with mountains of memory-laden possessions. (Her mantra: \u201cChoose to keep rather than choose to let go\u201d\u2014you\u2019ll cling to fewer things that way.)\n\nAlso helpful were tips spread throughout on when, why and how to call for help, whether from family, friends or professionals. (A growing number of companies specialize in helping seniors move, and in assisting families as they sort through the household goods.)\n\nHer suggestions about how to reframe daunting tasks as positive gambits struck me as invaluable. For example, rather than feeling paralyzing guilt about giving up the precious family home, she energized herself with the thought that she was helping finance her parents\u2019 remaining years. Similarly, as I sorted through belongings in the new apartment (including a fair amount of clutter I had not discarded before the move), I was not dumping the precious keepsakes, photos and other memorabilia; I was editing the collection down to size\u2014keeping the best, letting go of the rest.\n\nI also made it an opportunity to match up certain items with friends who would find them meaningful: a framed autographed photo of Yogi Berra and Don Larsen made a perfect milestone birthday gift for my friend the rabid Yankee fan.\n\nIn addition, I was particularly taken by Ms. Jamison\u2019s suggestion to rethink the entire job of downsizing and paring down as a gift\u2014not just to your parents (if you\u2019re helping them) or to yourself (in shaping a lightened-up and more efficient living space), but to your children or other relatives, who won\u2019t be stuck with the task.\n\nFinally, on a practical note, after following Ms. Jameson\u2019s advice to check market prices for just about anything on eBay and Craigslist, I corroborated my long-held intuition that my son\u2019s old Beanie babies weren\u2019t collector\u2019s items, after all. But just in case you discover items that are, Ms. Jamison also tells you how to decide if you need an appraiser and how to find one.\n\n\u201cNever Too Busy to Cure Clutter: Simplify Your Life One Minute at a Time\u201d by Erin Rooney Doland\n\nMs. Doland is less focused on getting rid of things. Rather, she concentrates on how to neatly organize the things you have. Do that, and you\u2019ll also more easily spot those broken-down or duplicate items (especially in such jumble-prone spots as your kitchen utensil drawer, medicine cabinet and coat closet) that you have neither need nor room for.\n\nIllustration: --\n\nMs. Doland advocates organizing room-by-room, cluttered nook by overcrowded cranny, and offers readers dozens of brief and easy uncluttering drills to keep things shipshape all the time, rather than continue procrastinating until the collective mess becomes overwhelming.\n\nFor example: Take 30 seconds to dust a single shelf; a minute to replace batteries or recharge your tech devices; several minutes to throw away that hoard of unused hotel shampoo samples. And if you think you don\u2019t have time even for that, make additional time by not folding freshly laundered underwear. Or buy multiple pairs of just one style of socks so you never need to waste time matching them.\n\nPhoto: --\n\nThis type of advice fit my style. I found myself adopting specific suggestions that left me feeling more efficient, such as taking regular one- to five-minute time chunks to gather and recycle papers, put my piano music in its proper place, inventory pantry needs and sort through rather than pile up daily detritus on my desk.\n\nThe suggestions for staying on an uncluttering track also helped: Watch out for clutter-blindness, for instance\u2014in my case becoming oblivious to newspapers piling up on the dining room table, or the good china and silver I haven\u2019t yet gotten around to putting away after a dinner party.\n\nStill, I know I will never reach neatness nirvana. Which is why I appreciated Ms. Doland\u2019s awareness that decluttering strategies will only stick for the long run if they make life easier, not harder, for you.\n\n\u201cSteer clear of any convoluted system that feels like it includes too many steps or would make it difficult for you to find things or put them away,\u201d she writes.

Some recent questions The Wall Street Journal has received, and the advice from experts:\n\nEight Questions to Ask Before Picking a College Knowing the answers to these questions should give you a financial head start VIEW Interactive ISTOCK\n\nWhen 529 funds are used to pay for college tuition, how does one prove to the IRS that the money was spent on tuition?\n\nWhen you have a 529 plan, you\u2019ll get a form 1099-Q detailing any withdrawals you make from your account, says Keith Bernhardt, vice president of retirement and college products at fund manager Fidelity Investments. \u201cHowever, it is up to the account owner to keep track of which withdrawals were for qualified higher education expenses and which withdrawals are not eligible for favorable tax treatment,\u201d he says. Beware: If you make any withdrawals that don\u2019t meet the IRS guidelines, you will have to report those on your tax returns, since there is a penalty.\n\nMany years ago I set up a 529 plan for my son. I funded his education from other sources and he has now finished college. Can I repay myself with a large lump sum without penalties even though the expenses occurred over a period of four years?\n\nAsk Us a Question Have a question about college finance in general? We\u2019ll be answering them in future funds reports. Send them to reports@wsj.com.\n\nThis approach could be asking for trouble. As a cash-basis taxpayer, \u201cyou must take the withdrawals in the same calendar year the expenses were paid,\u201d says Joseph Hurley, the founder of 529-advice site SavingForCollege.com. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to pay tax and a 10% penalty on the earnings portion of your withdrawals, he says. Such earnings may be considerable, depending on how long it has been since the years in which the withdrawals should have been made. Mr. Bernhardt sees a red flag as well. \u201cGenerally, it is wise to match 529 withdrawals with expenses incurred in the same tax year to avoid potential issues with the IRS,\u201d he says. You\u2019ll want to ask your accountant about this, Mr. Bernhardt says.\n\nCan 529 funds be used to cover travel costs to a commuter college?\n\nThe short answer is no. \u201cIn general, travel expenses are not included as a qualified higher-education expense,\u201d Mr. Bernhardt says. Investors can spend 529 funds on tuition, books, room and board, and other college-related expenses if they can show that these purchases are a requisite part of school. One exception: Special-needs beneficiaries might be able to show that their travel costs are required for them to attend a qualified educational institution. IRS publication 970 lays out which expenses qualify for 529 withdrawals under the rules.\n\nMy son has $15k saved from his job. Can he make a gift of this money to his parents, which we then put into his 529 for a tax break?\n\nThe main tax advantage of a 529 is that the money grows tax-free until withdrawn for qualified educational expenses. There are no federal income-tax breaks for 529 contributions; however, you might be able to get a state income-tax deduction, depending on where you live. Residents of New York state can deduct as much as $10,000 of 529 contributions each year, per couple, from their state tax returns. Check with your tax adviser about your own plan and state rules.\n\nOur son is now 22 and will be using the 529 we set up to pay for graduate-level study. Can we transfer ownership to him?\n\nThat depends on your 529\u2019s rules. Either way, says Mr. Bernhardt, even \u201cif your state\u2019s plan does not permit transferring ownership, you can still withdraw funds to pay for qualified education expenses at the graduate-school level.\u201d The original account owner can also roll over a 529 to a plan that allows ownership changes, Mr. Hurley says. It is also permitted to change a 529 account to benefit any direct relative of the original beneficiary.\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

Full-time workers spend an average of 97 minutes each day watching TV and movies, and 13 minutes reading for personal interest; retirees spend 223 minutes on the former and 48 minutes on the latter, activities that aren\u2019t likely to bust many budgets.\n\nSays Dr. Kalenkoski: \u201cThese are things that financial planners need to ask clients: What are you going to do with this new free time [in retirement]?

But that doesn\u2019t mean investors should never own junk, he says. It means holding high-yield bonds is only advantageous at certain times.\n\nWatching the spreads\n\nBased on data going back to 1983, Mr. Bernstein says the extra returns of high-yield bonds, in comparison with safer investment-grade bonds, aren\u2019t enough to justify owning them continuously, because of junk bonds\u2019 volatility and the uncertainty of their default rates.\n\nHowever, Mr. Bernstein says it does make sense for investors to own high-yield bonds when their \u201cspreads\u201d\u2014the difference between their yields and those of comparable U.S. Treasury securities\u2014are wide. That happens when the prices of high-yield bonds have fallen, pushing up their yields. On the other hand, he says, it makes sense to sell high-yield bonds when their spreads narrow, as they do when the bonds\u2019 prices rise. In other words, buy when prices are low and sell high.\n\n\u201cMost of the time, it\u2019s not worth it\u201d to own high-yield debt, Mr. Bernstein says. \u201cBut occasionally, in bad states of the world, it\u2019s nice to collect a double-digit yield premium while you\u2019re waiting for [bond] prices to recover.\u201d The yield premium is the spread.\n\nBut here\u2019s the rub: How wide spreads need to be to justify buying high-yield bonds and how narrow they need to be to justify selling are judgment calls that are easy to get wrong.\n\nIn a paper he wrote in 2001, Mr. Bernstein gave an example of how to approach that decision. Assuming a 7% default rate in a junk-bond portfolio and a 40% recovery rate\u2014meaning investors could expect to recover 40% of the face value of bonds in default\u2014the portfolio would have 4.2 percentage points shaved off its annual return because of defaults, he said. In that case, if the portfolio\u2019s yield were, say, 3 percentage points higher than that of comparable Treasury securities, that extra yield wouldn\u2019t be enough to offset the loss from the defaults. Investors would have been better off owning Treasurys. However, if the spread were, say, 9 percentage points, investors would do better by owning the junk bonds than they would by owning Treasurys\u2014given the assumed default and recovery rates.\n\nBut default and recovery rates are unpredictable. Historical averages may not match up with what happens during the next wave of defaults.\n\nAre we there yet?\n\nOne alternative for investors who want some exposure to high-yield debt without the confusion and risk of timing the market is to buy a fund that holds investment-grade as well as junk bonds, and let the fund manager decide on the ideal mix at any given point.\n\nA view similar to Mr. Bernstein\u2019s is held by the bond-specialist firm DoubleLine Capital, which runs several mutual funds. \u201cWe prefer to use high-yield bonds in the context of active sector allocation rather than always maintaining a static weighting to this area,\u201d says Kapil Singh, a portfolio manager at DoubleLine,\n\nMr. Singh is responsible for the high-yield allocation in the DoubleLine Core Fixed Income fund (DBLFX). The fund is designed to resemble the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.\n\nRelated How the Third Avenue Fund Melted Down (Dec. 23, 2015)\n\nOne alternative to get some high-yield exposure without the confusion and risk of timing the market is to buy a fund that holds investment-grade as well as junk bonds. Photo: Jorg Greuel/Getty Images\n\nHigh-yield bonds made up 8.1% of Core Fixed Income\u2019s portfolio in May but just 2.6% in November. The decision to sell most of the fund\u2019s high-yield position over the summer as prices in the sector tumbled helped Core Fixed Income finish in the top 2% of fund tracker Morningstar Inc. \u2019s intermediate-bond category for the five years through 2015, with a 5.1% annualized return.\n\nSo, now that junk-bond prices have come down significantly, is it time to add to high-yield holdings? Mr. Singh says his appetite for high-yield bonds is still limited, though he adds that the bonds of some companies he follows are beginning to become attractively priced.\n\nMr. Coumarianos, a former Morningstar analyst, is a writer in Laguna Hills, Calif.

But can tweets, likes and posts be used to pick stocks?\n\nAlthough some analysts point to the need for caution, a number of funds have sprung up that seek to use social-media information to generate returns. Perhaps the clearest example of this trend is Sprott Buzz Social Media Insights ETF (ticker symbol BUZ), which was launched in April. BUZ tracks the Buzz Social Media Insights Index, which analyzes data from social-media comments, blog posts and news articles to identify 25 stocks about which the online community is most bullish.\n\nCAN YOU PICK A WINNING STOCK?

VIEW Interactive\n\nThe Buzz index uses an analytics model that deploys artificial intelligence and algorithms intended to understand the tone of a conversation\u2014even including sarcasm. The index is reset every month, and a company must have a market cap of at least $5 billion to be included, though the stocks being talked about online tend to belong to the largest companies anyway, says Jamie Wise, the founder of Buzz Indexes.\n\nThe group knows best\n\nBUZ\u2019s managers won\u2019t intervene, even if a stock appears in the index that they don\u2019t personally rate.\n\n\u201cThat collective group decision-making is better than any one individual\u2019s ability to pick a stock, and so we\u2019re not going to insert ourselves on top of that process,\u201d says Mr. Wise.\n\nThe use of social-media data to inform investments is part of a broader trend toward exploiting big data, or very large sets of information that can be used to identify patterns or trends.\n\nBlackRock Inc. \u2019s Scientific Active Equity team uses big-data analysis in a number of its funds, says Jeff Shen, co-head of investments in the SAE Group and the head of emerging markets at the company. For example, individual investors dominate the Chinese stock market, and it can be difficult to figure out what they are thinking about, he says. The SAE group gathers information from the most popular social-media sites in the country in a bid to gain insight into a market that has been historically difficult to gauge.\n\nSocial-media sites are useful to figure out what Chinese individual investors are doing, says BlackRock.

CrowdInvest Wisdom ETF (WIZE) tracks an index of 35 stocks that are selected every month based on data gathered from an iOS app. It can be thought of as Tinder (a location-based dating app) for investing, says CrowdInvest Chief Executive Annie Wyatt : Users rate stocks as bullish or bearish, and the most-favored stocks are placed into the index.\n\nThe app is based on \u201cWisdom of the Crowd\u201d theory. Ms. Wyatt and her colleagues place no restrictions on who can download the app and vote, meaning a newcomer will be given the same power as an experienced long-term investor. The idea is that the group beats the wisdom of an individual.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that people from all walks of life are coming into the app and voting and expressing their opinions, and we don\u2019t ask for any reason why they\u2019re expressing these opinions,\u201d she says.\n\nThe potential of all that data is one of the attractions for investors when it comes to social-media companies themselves, says Jay Jacobs, director of research at Global X, whose Social Media Index ETF (SOCL) tracks the performance of the Solactive Social Media Total Return Index.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of different uses for that data, and it is a big component of revenues for these companies, so it should not be overlooked as an area of growth,\u201d he says.\n\nPureFunds ISE Big Data ETF (BIGD) aims to track the companies that are mining and analyzing the data. The fund was launched in July 2015, with the aim of tapping into the growing industry, say PureFunds CEO Andrew Chanin.\n\n\u201cI think people are going to become aware of how big this industry is.\u2026 If you\u2019re watching the financial news, it is tough to go an hour without hearing companies promoting their big-data solutions or analysts talking about the space or companies in the space,\u201d he says.\n\nCritics weigh in\n\nStill, the use of social-media data and big data more broadly has its critics. While social media can be an important source of information and can capture trends in the market, it will prompt most serious investors to carry out their own research, rather than relying on it directly for making an investment decision, says Neena Mishra, director of ETF Research at Zacks Investment Research.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think these can supplant the human analyst, at least not in the near term,\u201d she says. \u201cTrue, machines can process and analyze data much quicker compared with humans, but the challenge lies in deciding the importance of each piece of information in the investment decision.\u201d\n\nKiril Nikolaev, a financial analyst at ETFdb.com, also believes that while big-data analysis is increasingly important, it has potential drawbacks. For example, if everyone starts using the same or similar models to analyze information, the advantage will soon be \u201ccrowded out,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Cowan is a writer in London.

Whether read as an entertaining travelogue or a journey of self-discovery, Mr. Weber\u2019s book is worth the trip.\n\nClassic Thinking\n\nMore than 2,000 years have passed since Cicero, the Roman philosopher and statesman, wrote his essay \u201cOn Old Age.\u201d Today, his advice to embrace later life sounds refreshingly contemporary in retired classics professor Richard Gerberding\u2019s clever adaptation, \u201cHow To Be Old: The Thinking Person\u2019s Guide to Retirement.\u201d\n\nCicero\u2019s ideas\u2014based on his belief that \u201cthe best weapons against old age are your inner qualities, those virtues which you have cultivated at every stage of your lives\u201d\u2014remain intact. But Mr. Gerberding makes them more accessible by replacing Cicero\u2019s references to ancient Greek and Roman statesmen with modern figures like William Fulbright, Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy.\n\n\u201cSomeone who doesn\u2019t have much in the way of inner resources will find all stages of life irksome,\u201d Cicero wrote.

She managed to rack up eight more world records in the year before her death in June at age 95.\n\nBefore she died, she agreed to work with author Bruce Grierson as he set out to discover the mix of genetics, diet, physiology, lifestyle and character that contributed to her energized longevity.

It gets even harder when they don\u2019t have the best funds to choose from in the first place.\n\nNew academic research shows that mutual-fund companies tend to favor their own funds when setting the menus for the 401(k) plans they administer. And, more important, they tend to keep those funds on the menu even when the funds are underperforming. This apparent conflict of interest, the researchers found, can result in significant losses for investors.\n\nCAN YOU PICK A WINNING STOCK? Welcome back to 2006!

VIEW Interactive\n\nWe spoke with Clemens Sialm, professor of finance at the University of Texas at Austin and a co-author of the study, with Indiana University\u2019s Veronika Pool and Federal Reserve economist Irina Stefanescu, in the Journal of Finance. Excerpts from that interview:\n\nConflicts studied\n\nWSJ: Your research examined conflicts of interest for 401(k) plan providers. What kinds of conflicts were you looking at?\n\nPROF. SIALM: In the U.S., most 401(k) plans follow an open architecture, which means that some of the options on the menu are affiliated with the service provider of the plan, and other options are unaffiliated, offered by different fund companies.\n\nWe wanted to see whether there is favoritism toward the affiliated funds. It is similar to when you have kids, and you might favor your own kids compared with your neighbor\u2019s kids. We wanted to see whether the options being offered to retirement savers are appropriate.\n\nWSJ: What was your methodology, and what did you find?\n\nPROF. SIALM: We hand-collected data covering 2,500 distinct plans from 1998 to 2009. What we looked at were the decisions to add and delete options on the menu. We wanted to see whether those additions and deletions depend on the affiliation of the fund with the service provider.\n\nWhat we find is that, first of all, providers are significantly less likely to delete affiliated funds than unaffiliated funds. And, more interestingly, the effect is much stronger for poorly performing funds. Providers are much less likely to delete poorly performing funds if the funds are their own.\n\nSo, we conclude that there is favoritism toward the providers\u2019 own affiliated options.\n\nEffect on investors\n\nWSJ: How does this affect people who invest in 401(k) plans?\n\nPROF. SIALM: The fact that those poorly performing funds aren\u2019t deleted can often be costly for retirement savers. What we find is that for the worst decile of funds\u2014those that performed among the worst 10% over the prior years\u2014they will continue to underperform by about 4 percentage points for the next year if they are kept on the menu.\n\nWSJ: Did your study look at how individual investors treat those underperforming funds?\n\nPROF. SIALM: Yes, and what we find is that they typically don't react much to performance. That is consistent with prior literature that has shown that individual participants in 401(k) plans are quite inert, they don't monitor their options, they often don\u2019t pay close attention to fees.\n\nWSJ: Investors are often told not to chase performance. Isn\u2019t inertia sometimes a good thing?\n\nPROF. SIALM: The mutual-fund literature has devoted a lot of attention to this question of whether performance is persistent. The general conclusion is that for the top performers, there is not a lot of persistence. But on the other hand, there is more performance persistence for poor performers. For the underperforming funds we looked at in our study, we also found that they continued to underperform in the subsequent year.\n\nSo it is important to see how your funds are performing. If they\u2019re performing poorly, you might want to investigate why, and it is reasonable to consider selling them. But I agree that you shouldn\u2019t just blindly chase performance, especially when it comes to timing the markets of different asset classes.\n\nWSJ: What can individual investors do to overcome the favoritism you\u2019ve identified?\n\nPROF. SIALM: A lot of individual 401(k) investors might not be experts in making financial decisions, but what they should do is try to inform themselves and to analyze the options being offered. And if they see that their company doesn\u2019t offer a good plan, then they should lobby their company to improve it.\n\nThe strength of 401(k) plans is that they enable the whole population to participate in the stock and bond markets. But for people to be able to do that effectively, it is important that they acquire the necessary information to make good decisions.\n\nUse independents?\n\nWSJ: To avoid conflicts of interest, should 401(k) plans be administered by independent firms instead of fund companies?\n\nPROF. SIALM: Some service providers already are independent, although the proportion of plans run by mutual-fund companies has increased from about 60% in 1998 to 75% in 2009.\n\nBut we don\u2019t find that plans run by mutual-fund companies are necessarily worse than independent plans. They do have some advantages. For example, we found that the fees charged by affiliated funds are lower on average. There are potentially some synergies. And, if you bring in another provider, you potentially have another layer of costs and fees.\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nWSJ: What are the broader implications of your research?\n\nPROF. SIALM: The implications of our findings are that 401(k) participants and sponsors should pay closer attention to the options being offered. It is important for companies to look after their employees and offer good investment options. It is important also for employees to monitor their investment options and form well-diversified portfolios that enable them to efficiently save for retirement.\n\nMr. Blackman is a writer in Crete.

Photo: Jessica Elberfeld\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that students looking to minimize education debt could potentially shave thousands of dollars off the cost of a four-year degree by going to community college first.\n\nThe average annual tuition at a two-year public college was $3,435 last academic year, compared with $9,410 for a public four-year school in-state, according to the College Board.\n\nBut what many students and families may not realize is that successfully transitioning from a two-year college to a four-year one and graduating in a timely fashion can be a challenge\u2014and unless students can accomplish that, they may not reap the full return on their investment in education.\n\nThe problem is, only 14% of degree-seeking students who entered community college in the fall of 2007 earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from a four-year school within six years, according to a January study from the Community College Research Center at Teachers College, Columbia University. Among those who transferred to a four-year school, 42% earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in six years, the study found.\n\nBy comparison, about 58% of students who enrolled in a four-year public school as freshmen in 2009 graduated within a six-year time-frame, according to the National Student Clearinghouse.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk to students who\u2019ve done it, it\u2019s almost amazing that anyone has gotten through,\u201d says Davis Jenkins, a senior research associate at the Community College Research Center and one of the report\u2019s authors.\n\nExperts say students who plan to start at community college and then transfer should have a plan to ensure the process goes smoothly. Here are some tips:\n\nPlan your credit transfer\n\nOne of the biggest challenges community-college students face is transferring their credits, Mr. Jenkins says. Less than 60% of community-college students successfully bring most of their credits to a four-year school and roughly 15% essentially have to start over, according to research published in 2015 in the journal Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis.\n\nAlex T. Williams says he largely had to take the transfer process into his own hands, even though the two Texas colleges he attended had an agreement designed to make the transfer process easier. He met with advisers frequently, but often received contradictory information about what credits would carry over.\n\n\u201cI found the process very confusing and arcane,\u201d says the 29-year-old Mr. Williams, a doctoral candidate at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication.\n\nSo-called articulation agreements, which outline how and when credits will transfer, are common among in-state schools. But students need to review such agreements carefully, including any grade-point-average requirements, says Kevin Fudge, the director of consumer advocacy and ombudsman at American Student Assistance, an organization focused on helping students pay for college and manage debt. Students also should ask advisers for help. \u201cDon\u2019t go it alone,\u201d he says.\n\nAndy Lockwood, a Jericho, N.Y.-based financial-aid consultant, suggests families sit down from the start with an admissions officer at the school to which the student plans to transfer to discuss which community-college classes will carry over and which won\u2019t. They should get something in writing, he says.\n\nJessica Elberfeld of Nashville, who enrolled in community college after graduating from high school in 2005, met early on with an admissions officer at Belmont University, the private four-year school to which she planned to transfer. She then picked her community-college courses based on material she received during that visit.\n\n\u201cStaying on the ball from day one and making sure those credits transferred really helped,\u201d says the 29-year-old Ms. Elberfeld, who graduated from Belmont in 2009 and now works as a sales representative for VF Imagewear. Ms. Elberfeld says she borrowed about $68,000 to attend Belmont, a sum she says would have been higher had she not spent two years at community college paid for through scholarships.\n\nUse it as a supplement\n\nWhile students who manage the transfer process successfully may be able to cut their college costs by one-quarter to one-third, those who miss their ultimate destination\u2014a bachelor\u2019s degree\u2014may not reap as large a return on their education investment, says Mark Kantrowitz, a financial-aid expert and the publisher of Cappex.com, a college scholarship and search site.\n\nHe believes there are benefits to enrolling in a four-year college from the start, and taking cheaper community-college classes on the side.\n\nWorking students and others who can\u2019t handle the 15 credits a semester typically needed to graduate on time, for example, might benefit by going to community college over the summer.\n\n\u201cYou can take the community-college classes to save money but you\u2019re in the four-year environment where people are there to get a bachelor\u2019s degree,\u201d which isn\u2019t always the case at a community college, Mr. Kantrowitz says.\n\nEnrolling in a four-year school as a freshman also may net students a more generous financial-aid package than they would get if they started as a transfer, he says.\n\nGet an associate degree\n\nCost isn\u2019t the only reason students might choose to start at community college.\n\nStudents who performed poorly in high school may be able to increase their chances of getting into a reputable four-year school by excelling academically at community college, says Mr. Lockwood.\n\nSome experts advise community-college students to zero in on a major as soon as possible.\n\nMany four-year colleges expect students to know their major when transferring, Mr. Kantrowitz says, and some even require students to apply to a specific program or school and evaluate them based on the major they\u2019ve chosen. Knowing what they want to do early on allows community-college students to take the right prerequisite courses.\n\nFinally, students who plan to start at community college should aim to leave with an associate degree, experts say. Research indicates that transfer students with an associate degree are more likely to complete a bachelor\u2019s degree than those without, all other factors being equal. What\u2019s more, they will always have that credential to fall back on should they fail to graduate from the four-year school, Mr. Jenkins says.\n\nA winding path to a bachelor\u2019s degree may become more of the norm as college costs rise, experts say. But as long as students finish what they started, they are unlikely to be hurt by going to a less-prestigious school first.\n\n\u201cIt matters where you finish not where you start,\u201d says Mr. Lockwood. \u201cEvery graduate-school admissions officer and every employer respects that.\u201d\n\nMs. Berman is a reporter for MarketWatch in New York.

The housemates spend time together and carpool to events. Photo: Janus Family\n\nThink sharing a home is just for college students and millennials?\n\nRenting out a spare bedroom, even for a few days a month, can yield serious benefits for older homeowners, financial and retirement experts say. In addition to more income and companionship, it may give seniors stretched by high housing costs a way to stay in their homes longer.\n\nOnly about 2% of older people currently live in a household with someone other than a family member, a percentage that has stayed relatively constant for decades, according to an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. But experts expect those numbers to rise, driven by economic need, demographic changes in society, and online services that make it easier for lodgers and homeowners to connect.\n\nOne reason seniors may be increasingly likely to share their homes is a lack of retirement savings, according to Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research and a professor at Boston College\u2019s Carroll School of Management. More than half of all working-age households, and 43% of those in the top-third income bracket, haven\u2019t saved enough to replace their income in retirement, Ms. Munnell says. For many, renting out a spare room thus offers a way to help pay the bills each month.\n\nDeborah Hirshfield, a 67-year-old retired art and music teacher in Evanston, Ill., says she began renting out a room in her condo six years ago when she discovered her pension payments were going to be less than she had hoped. Ms. Hirshfield, who rents the room to postdoctoral students working at nearby Northwestern University, says the extra income has allowed her to stay in the home where she has lived for the past 25 years. She finds her tenants through places4students.com, and gets help vetting applicants and drawing up rental agreements from Open Communities, a nonprofit that advocates fair-housing policies based in nearby Winnetka, Ill.\n\nSharing apps\n\nThousands of other older homeowners, meanwhile, are discovering sharing applications like Airbnb Inc. that help them rent out rooms on a short-term basis, says Kenneth Smith, a senior research scholar and director at Stanford University\u2019s Stanford Center on Longevity.\n\nSeniors are Airbnb\u2019s fastest-growing demographic in the U.S. Senior Airbnb hosts, those older than 60, doubled from March 2015 to March 2016, according to a recent analysis by the San Francisco-based company. There are now 62,000, making up 13% of all Airbnb hosts in the country.\n\nThe average older Airbnb host has guests for about 60 days a year, according to a separate recent survey by Airbnb, which the Stanford center helped design, that looked at the company\u2019s listings globally. Among older hosts, 49% said their primary reason for hosting was financial; 43%, meanwhile, said their motivation was to meet new people, stay socially connected or be active.\n\nFor homeowners who crave more social interaction, using sharing apps isn\u2019t the only way, of course. Cynthia Janus, a retired medical librarian, says she rents out the bottom floor of her home in Silver Spring, Md., to a close friend at a below-market price, creating what she calls \u201ca retirement home for two.\u201d Divorced with no children, Ms. Janus says she enjoys discussing her day and drinking coffee together with her housemate. They also carpool to events.\n\nHelping hands\n\nAnother big reason retirees may consider opening up their homes: for help around the house. In an AARP survey published in 2014, some 38% of respondents (ages 45 and up) said they would consider sharing their home as they grow older, while 26% said they would do so for extra income. A whopping 43% said they would consider it for help with everyday activities, like transportation or household chores.\n\nHelping hands are an increasingly valuable commodity for older homeowners and may become a more common reason for taking in a boarder, says Stephen Golant, a gerontologist, professor at the University of Florida and author of \u201cAging in the Right Place.\u201d Traditional sources of such help have declined in recent years, Mr. Golant says, as more women have entered the workforce, as families continue to live in disparate parts of the country, and as older couples, especially baby boomers, divorce.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear\n\nThere are a few caveats for seniors considering house-sharing. For those who want to make chores or other responsibilities a condition of a rental agreement, for example, experts advise describing such expectations clearly in the written agreement beforehand.\n\nMany older people also may find that sharing their homes infringes on their privacy and threatens their ability to control their personal surroundings, says Mr. Golant. Like most Americans, seniors cherish self-reliance and are likely to want to stay independent as long as possible, he says. So, homeowners should be aware of what they are potentially giving up, as well as what they have to gain by taking on a boarder.\n\nLastly, some warn that for many seniors, house-sharing should be seen as a temporary solution. Andrew Carle, an adjunct professor at George Mason University and chief operating officer at Affinity Living Group, a senior-housing company, notes that while boarders may be happy to assist with basic tasks, like transportation, there is often a tipping point where daily tasks, like grooming, walking and keeping track of medications, become exceedingly difficult and more professional care may be required.\n\n\u201cHouse-sharing,\u201d says Mr. Carle, \u201cis likely to work really well\u2014until someone faces the real trials of old age.\u201d\n\nMs. Ward is a writer in Mendham, N.J.

What does this mean for U.S. citizens living in countries with weakened currencies?\n\nFinancial advisers say the dollar\u2019s rise is an opportunity\u2014just not the type some people might expect. Most expats should resist the urge to buy lots of foreign cash on the cheap, advisers say. And think twice about diving into foreign property or equity markets, attractive as they might seem these days.\n\nThe problem with those moves, advisers say, is that they increase the risk of expats being burned by the inevitable further shifts in currency markets and in the value of big purchases.\n\nInstead, expats can take this opportunity to improve their financial situation now and reduce their currency risk, experts say. For instance, they can reduce foreign-currency debt, or rebalance their holdings of dollars and foreign currency in a way that best suits their personal situation rather than the current state of the currency markets.\n\nJessica Williamson says the stronger dollar has made it cheaper for family and friends to visit her in the U.K. Photo: Louis Martineau\n\nAnd sure, expats can go ahead and splurge a little on things that have suddenly come within reach of their budget, advisers say\u2014as long as they don\u2019t allow that spending to throw off their long-term financial plans.\n\nHere are what advisers and longtime expats say are some key strategies to pursue in today\u2019s strong-dollar environment.\n\nPay down foreign debts\n\n\u201cThose hoping to accelerate the repayment of foreign debts have just been handed a huge windfall,\u201d says David Kuenzi, founding partner of Thun Financial Advisors in Madison, Wis., who works with U.S. expats.\n\nWith every dollar now translating into more foreign currency, expats with savings in U.S. dollars can use some of that money to shorten the life of mortgages, car loans or other foreign-currency debts, he says.\n\nAnd paying down that debt has an added benefit. Expats need to be very careful about \u201ccurrency misalignment\u201d\u2014having too much cash in either their home currency or the currency of the country in which they live and work\u2014says Mr. Kuenzi. Sitting on big piles of cash in either currency exposes expats to fluctuations in currency markets, he says, so paying off foreign-currency debts can put cash to work and reduce that risk.\n\nDon\u2019t go on a spending spree\n\nIt can be a blessing and a curse. When the dollar rises, everything from taxi fares to meals to houses are cheaper in foreign markets for people with dollars to convert. But don\u2019t let that trigger a spending spree, on small items or big investments, advisers say.\n\nThe biggest danger here is that big investments like real estate or major stock purchases may lose value not only because of shifting foreign-exchange rates but also because of turns in property and financial markets. For instance, U.S. expats who use the dollar\u2019s strength to buy property abroad now might regret the decision later if they hope to resell the property at a nifty profit as part of a retirement plan, says Fran\u00e7ois Du Pasquier, head of foreign exchange for Citigroup \u2019s Citi Private Bank North America.\n\nKristopher Heck, a managing partner at Tanager Wealth Management, a London firm that offers financial planning for trans-Atlantic households, warns of the similar risk in loading up on foreign stocks. A stronger dollar means this can be a good time to take on more exposure to foreign equities, but only with funds investors have set aside for high-risk investments, not with money they can\u2019t afford to lose, Mr. Heck says. Investors should avoid getting overly excited and buying shares with funds that should stay out of the market, such as money from an emergency fund, he says.\n\nDouglas Coombs, a U.S. expat in Colombia, says changes in the foreign-exchange rate have made his investment dollars go further at his startup. Photo: Ra\u00fal Alejandro Torres Ajiaco\n\nSmall-scale purchases can cause problems, too, advisers say, if they turn into budget busters. Douglas Coombs, a 29-year-old U.S. expat in Colombia, has faced that temptation. For the past three years, the entrepreneur has been living in Bogot\u00e1, but has kept most of his money in dollars. He is running a startup and has been using savings to fund the company. These days, he has been impressed to see how much farther his dollar goes\u2014whether invested in his company or spent around town.\n\nRestaurants, clothing and other consumer goods used to cost him more in Colombia than they did in the U.S. Now that his dollar is going further, Mr. Coombs finds himself going out to eat more often and indulging in expenses like Uber rides. But he\u2019s careful not to let these cheaper goods and services derail his startup investment plans. Mr. Coombs says he now spends less than he used to personally, and has maintained his startup budget.\n\nPlan around the length of time abroad, not the market\n\nWhile it might be tempting to think about trading lots of dollars for the local currency to take advantage of the current market, doing so as an expat who only plans to be abroad for a short time\u2014say, one or two years\u2014is \u201csilly and risky,\u201d says Mr. Heck.\n\nInstead of obsessing over each shift in the foreign-exchange markets, expats should focus on how long they plan to be abroad and convert their money based on those expectations, he says.\n\nFor example, expats who only expect to be abroad for a couple of years should only convert what U.S. cash they think they will need for that period above and beyond their incomes, he says. But those planning to be long-term expats may want to convert much more of their cash to the local currency, he says\u2014even all of it in some cases\u2014especially if they plan to buy a home in the next few months.\n\nThe basic idea is the same as Mr. Kuenzi\u2019s advice about avoiding currency misalignment\u2014money should be in the form it will be used in, so that as little as possible is exposed to the danger of losing value upon conversion.\n\nInvite family from the U.S. over now\n\nThe fun upside of the dollar\u2019s rise is that travel is easier and cheaper for Americans abroad. Some expats say they are trying to time trips with family and friends around the current upswing to save money\u2014and awkwardness.\n\n\u201cI used to feel so guilty when my family came to see me,\u201d says Jessica Williamson, a director at the London office of Techstars, a startup accelerator with locations in the U.S. and Europe. Prices in the U.K. were so high in dollar terms that when her stepmother came to stay for two weeks a few years ago, she stayed in Ms. Williamson\u2019s apartment to avoid a massive hotel bill.\n\nFor years, going out with friends and family from the States was stressful because it felt like a financial imposition on people. Now, Ms. Williamson feels more comfortable taking visitors out and having them pay their share of the bill.\n\nMr. Wells is a news editor for The Wall Street Journal in London.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/expats-discover-credit-scores-dont-travel-well-1428894132", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "There is one valuable that even highly paid U.S. expatriates struggle to carry with them when they move overseas: their credit score.\n\nPeople accustomed to high credit limits and premium financial products in the U.S. can be in for a rude surprise when they try to set up house abroad. Some say they have been stunned to find themselves unable to secure the most basic credit required for housing, cars and credit cards.\n\nWhen expats arrive in foreign countries, most expect to open a local bank account to help them get settled. But most countries\u2019 banking systems won\u2019t consider the numeric credit scores that banks in the U.S. use to evaluate creditworthiness. Most have their own methods and evaluation systems, and some countries penalize residents who haven\u2019t voted in local elections, even though most expats can\u2019t vote. Banks can check this information when they carry out credit checks.\n\nBuilding this trust takes a lot of care and feeding that locals have been doing for years. For expats, this often means starting from scratch, applying for basic credit cards and bank accounts, slowly building a local credit report. In some countries, it can take years\u2014even becoming a citizen\u2014to access a country\u2019s full range of credit options, like getting a mortgage.\n\n\u201cCredit scores are highly regulated,\u201d says David Kuenzi, a wealth manager based in Madison, Wis., who works with U.S. expat families. Scores are \u201cbased upon government regulation and standards agreed upon between banks and reporting companies, and generally those agreements are done at a national level,\u201d Mr. Kuenzi explains. \u201cIt can really be a pain.\u201d\n\nPlatinum bust\n\nAlex Carey was living in Norwalk, Conn., and making around $250,000 a year working for an online advertising firm when he was promoted to an executive position in London. He needed to make the move with his family quickly, but upon arriving in the U.K. in 2011, he says he was surprised to find that the credit he had established with his platinum American Express card did not move with him. A lack of British credit made it difficult for him to buy a home or car.\n\nMr. Carey, 33, owned a house in Connecticut, so he figured securing housing in London would be straightforward. But to sign a lease on an apartment in England, he says he was told he would be subjected to a background check in addition to verification of his salary and banking activity. Just opening a new bank account took three months, he says. And there was no way for him to ride on the credit he had built from his U.S. home equity.\n\nThe family also needed a car. But, again, without U.K. credit, he says, he couldn\u2019t get a car loan. He ended up paying in cash for what he calls \u201ca beater,\u201d a 2004 Renault Scenic, which he says cost \u00a32,000 (about $2,960).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been living in the U.K. for around 3\u00bd years and have just learned to pay cash for things,\u201d Mr. Carey says.\n\nPlastic advantage\n\nBut for other Americans moving abroad, don\u2019t be too quick to leave the plastic at the border. Indeed, for those planning to live abroad long term, financial advisers say keeping a U.S. credit card is one of the simplest ways to maintain a line of credit at home. Experts recommend making small, fairly regular transactions to keep these accounts active and up-to-date.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nTara Yip-Bannicq, a 30-year-old consultant currently based in Bangkok, says she has held a U.S. credit card for much of her adult life to keep a reasonable credit score in the U.S., where she is a citizen. While Ms. Yip-Bannicq has been living overseas for the past 20 years, she says, she keeps up on her credit-card payments fastidiously, and pays her U.S. taxes.\n\nBut even maintaining a line of U.S. credit isn\u2019t a cure-all for expats. Recently, Ms. Yip-Bannicq wanted to refinance a U.S. student loan, she says, but was told that because of her credit, she would need a guarantor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a shock when you\u2019re over 30 to find that you need a guarantor,\u201d says Ms. Yip-Bannicq, who adds she thinks that the guarantor issue was the result of her living abroad for such a long period.\n\nWatch the fees\n\nSome expats who can\u2019t easily get foreign credit cards continue to use their domestic cards for the majority of purchases. Tom Feltner, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, recommends watching out for even small international transaction fees on purchases. \u201cThose can range 2% to 3%, which might seem small, but ultimately can dramatically increase cost of borrowing,\u201d he says.\n\nMany companies offer cards for frequent travelers without the fees.\n\nKeep an eye on the card\u2019s exchange rate, too, says Kristopher Heck, a managing partner at Tanager Wealth Management, a London firm that offers financial planning for trans-Atlantic households. A U.S. credit card with a less-than-ideal exchange rate can dramatically raise borrowing costs.\n\nFor expats planning to stay in a particular country for the long term, Mr. Heck recommends building local credit early. One method, he says, is to obtain a credit card from a local retail store with a high interest rate.\n\n\u201cUse it once a month,\u201d he says, \u201cand slowly see your credit build with a trickle of transactions.\u201d\n\nMr. Wells is a news editor for The Wall Street Journal in London.

All of his children and grandchildren were given a copy and the document is also available online.\n\nThe publication has been crucial in helping the younger family members feel connected to the founder, Ms. Thakkar says. It has also helped them understand why the foundation focuses on funding Chicago-area charities.\n\n\u201cAlthough I never met my great-grandfather, I can better understand why he started the foundation and what his intentions were,\u201d says Caitlyn Hicks, age 23, who works at the foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s helped to show me how important it is to give back to the community and instilled in me a value of helping others.\u201d\n\nTrain them early\n\nGetting children involved in philanthropy from an early age helps set the stage for foundation service later on, says Nathan Dungan, a wealth counselor and owner of Share Save Spend in Minneapolis.\n\nThird generation Tracy family members Liz and Gracie volunteering at the Food Pantry at Share the Harvest in the summer of 2014. Photo: Mike Buckley\n\nOne family Mr. Dungan works with has created a \u201ckids club\u201d for younger children (ages 5 to 15) where they collectively decide and plan family service projects during the year. A foundation board member mentors the children.\n\nThe family also holds regular group discussions with younger children on issues such as transportation, housing and hunger to help them understand how different another young person\u2019s day-to-day experience may be from their own and why the foundation\u2019s work is important.\n\nWhen \u201cchildren/young adults develop the habit of giving early in life, it provides a huge advantage later on because they\u2019re already in a pattern of discernment about who, what, when, how and why to give,\u201d Mr. Dungan says.\n\nThomas Blaney, director of foundation services at accounting and advisory firm O\u2019Connor Davies in New York, says the grooming of future leaders should be a gradual process.\n\nHe suggests having younger family members serve on foundation committees before joining the board. He also advises encouraging them to shadow veteran members to gain knowledge and once elected to the board, giving them time to learn the ropes before putting them in leadership roles.\n\nTraining programs such as Exponent Philanthropy\u2019s Next Gen Fellows program also can help prepare younger family members for leadership roles within family foundations, says Marguerite Griffin, national director of philanthropic services at Northern Trust in Chicago.\n\nGive them a voice and a vote\n\nWithout a voice and a vote, younger family members may lose interest in the family\u2019s philanthropic work, says Scott Winget, senior managing director of wealth impact planning for Ascent Private Capital Management, a unit of U.S. Bank, in Denver.\n\nMr. Winget says he worked with a couple who set up a multimillion-dollar foundation partly because they wanted to bond with their adult children.\n\nThird generation Tracy family members Michaela and Olivia volunteering at the Share the Harvest garden in the summer of 2014. Photo: Mike Buckley\n\nThe couple held foundation meetings and invited the children to help make distribution decisions, thinking their heirs would be excited to be part of attaching the family name to gifts in their community, Mr. Winget says.\n\nThe problem was the couple wanted to support the major arts and scientific institutions in their town, while the children wanted to give to international humanitarian causes.\n\nWhen the children weren\u2019t permitted to give grants to their causes, they stopped coming to foundation meetings, he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to assume that just because one generation is passionate about a cause or issue that the next generation will follow suit,\u201d says Mr. Dungan.\n\nTo avoid that kind of disconnect, the Tracy Family Foundation in Mount Sterling, Ill., says it has made it a point to give younger family members a real say in the organization\u2019s business.\n\nThe foundation\u2019s bylaws require that three of the organization\u2019s 10 board seats go to third-generation family members. Two of those three seats are just one-year terms, providing more opportunity for younger family members to get involved, says Jean Tracy Buckley, the foundation\u2019s president.\n\n\u201cYou must give them meaningful work for them to remain engaged,\u201d Ms. Buckley says.\n\nThe family also hosts an annual \u201dnext gen\u201d meeting during their family vacation at the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri, and has a grant program that empowers younger family members to make grants to charities they like and gives them incentives to volunteer.\n\n\u201cEvery family member\u2019s contribution feels valued and appreciated,\u201d says 33-year-old Rob Tracy, who served as the treasurer of the foundation from ages 25 to 31.\n\nBe open to change\n\nWhen the time comes for younger heirs to carry on the family\u2019s philanthropic legacy, older family members need to be open to fresh ideas, says Sapphira Goradia, executive director of the Goradia Foundation in Houston.\n\nMs. Goradia, who is 31, says she and her parents were passionate about many of the same causes, such as health care, but they had different visions about how the foundation should go about supporting them.\n\nHer parents wanted to write checks to the charities they believed in and attend their annual fundraising galas, Ms. Goradia says, while she wanted the foundation to take a more hands-on role with the causes it supported and become more strategic with its giving.\n\nShe pushed to create a mission statement for the foundation. Fortunately, she says, her parents were willing to compromise and collaborated with her on creating it.\n\nAfter several discussions, they agreed that the percentage of foundation disbursements that followed the mission statement would increase each year. This allowed them to phase out nonstrategic funding gradually, she says.\n\nHer parents\u2019 willingness to be open-minded and move the foundation in a new direction was vital, says Ms. Goradia. \u201cWhen involving the next generation, don\u2019t assume that they will continue doing things the way you have.\u201d\n\nGive them time\n\nBecoming a philanthropist is an \u201cevolution\u201d that often takes time, so it\u2019s important not to pressure younger family members into taking on big foundation roles before they are ready, says Northern Trust\u2019s Ms. Griffin.\n\nSome younger heirs may show little interest in participating in the family\u2019s philanthropic work, especially if they are building careers of their own or raising small children, she says, but that can easily change.\n\nFoundations should provide enough flexibility to allow younger family members to stay involved with whatever level of commitment they\u2019re capable of giving, she says.\n\n\u201cOver time, things can change and the pressure to participate should be minimized,\u201d says Ms. Griffin.\n\nMs. Dagher is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

This year, droves of investors who did conversions in 2010 have reached the end of the five-year waiting period and so can qualify to tap their Roths without penalty or taxes\u2014as long as they follow IRS rules.\n\nIt\u2019s important to have a strategy, financial advisers say, especially when an investor has more than one type of retirement account\u2014say, a 401(k) or a traditional individual retirement account in addition to a Roth. For example, delaying Roth withdrawals could help smooth the tax impact of distributions people must start taking from traditional IRAs after age 70\u00bd. Also, a Roth left untouched for years could become a significant legacy for heirs.\n\nHere is a look at how best to capitalize on a Roth\u2019s advantages in combination with one\u2019s other retirement assets:\n\nFirst, remember the ground rules. Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, and the money won\u2019t get taxed until it\u2019s withdrawn. There is no deduction for contributions to a Roth, but they can be withdrawn without penalty. However, there are certain criteria for withdrawing the funds from a Roth IRA conversion without penalty. (The rules are complex, so it might be worth consulting a tax expert before taking any distributions.)\n\nBalance withdrawals with taxes in mind. People with most of their savings in a traditional IRA or other tax-deferred account have less control over taxes in retirement because after they reach 70\u00bd, minimum annual distributions are required. If they incur a large expense and are forced to take a larger-than-customary distribution, bad results can follow.\n\nSuppose a retiree needed $50,000 for a major expense. Unless that person could pay the resulting taxes out of another source, the distribution from the traditional IRA would have to be significantly higher to cover the tax obligation and still net $50,000, says Stuart Ritter, senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price. Being forced to take a bigger taxable distribution also could push the retiree into a higher marginal tax bracket, which, in turn, could increase his or her Medicare premiums and the taxes owed on Social Security benefits.\n\nDistributions from a Roth, by contrast, aren\u2019t taxed as long as they are qualified distributions. Funds moved into a Roth from a traditional IRA must have been in the account for at least five years, and if the recipient isn\u2019t over 59\u00bd, the distribution must be for a qualified first-time home purchase or the result of a death or disability.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nOwning a Roth along with a traditional IRA provides \u201ctax diversification,\u201d says Mr. Ritter. If the $50,000 came out of a Roth, he says, it might not be taxed at all, \u201cand none of that other collateral damage would happen.\u201d\n\nKeep the right asset in the right account. For investors who have a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA, putting certain types of assets in each account can have benefits, says Scott Thoma, principal in client-needs research at St. Louis-based Edward Jones.\n\nTraditional IRA owners past age 70\u00bd will generally want to maintain enough liquidity in the account to cover withdrawals, so keeping some cash and short-term bonds in the account can be a good idea. Another choice might be an equity fund that has an active trading strategy and generates substantial short-term capital gains. Account owners pay taxes on the distributions, not the capital gains.\n\nFor a Roth, in contrast, it may make sense to invest more aggressively, in stocks or other assets that have potential to appreciate significantly over a long time, Mr. Thoma says.\n\nWhatever an account-holder puts in each account, he adds, the combined asset mix should be based on risk appetite and the timetable for needing to tap the assets.\n\nView a Roth as a potential legacy. People who don\u2019t need to tap a Roth in retirement because they have other assets should consider leaving the Roth untouched and bequeathing it to children or grandchildren, says Dave Polstra, a founding partner at Atlanta-based Brightworth Private Wealth Counsel. \u201cThat\u2019s the last bucket of money you would want to tap, because the goal is tax-free accumulation and then tax-free distribution for the children or grandchildren over many, many years,\u201d Mr. Polstra says.\n\nThose who inherit a Roth are required to take annual distributions during their lifetimes in amounts based on the oldest beneficiary\u2019s life expectancy. Still, that could mean a potentially long period for further asset growth in a Roth, Mr. Polstra notes.\n\nIgnore tax chatter in Washington. The Obama administration recently proposed changes in tax rules for Roth IRAs, though it\u2019s difficult to know whether any will be enacted.\n\nUnder one, Roth IRA holders would have to begin taking required minimum distributions each year starting at age 70\u00bd, the same as for a traditional IRA. Currently, there is no mandatory distribution required from a Roth. A second proposal would require people other than spouses who inherit the proceeds of a Roth to take out the assets within five years of the owner\u2019s death.\n\nEach of these proposed changes could encounter opposition in Congress. In the meantime, financial professionals advise account-holders to manage their accounts based on current tax law, not possible changes.\n\n\u201cEven though the potential treatment of certain types of accounts is up for discussion, we never know exactly what will be signed into law and what won\u2019t be,\u201d says Ken Hevert, head of retirement products at Fidelity Investments. \u201cWe try to manage according to what we know for sure.\u201d\n\nMr. Pollock is a writer in Ridgewood, N.J. He can be reached at reports@wsj.com.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nTraditional IRA owners past age 70\u00bd will generally want to maintain enough liquidity in the account to cover withdrawals. However, owners also are permitted to take \u201cin-kind\u201d distributions, moving securities from an IRA account into a taxable brokerage account. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that IRA owners must maintain enough liquidity to cover withdrawals. Separately, contributions to a Roth IRA\u2014although not earnings from the contributions\u2014can be withdrawn without restrictions or penalty. An earlier version incorrectly stated that in order to withdraw contributions account holders must meet a five-year holding requirement or other criteria.

Financial psychologist Dr. Brad Klontz discusses with Tanya Rivero. Photo: iStock/InkkStudios\n\nMoney is one of the biggest sources of marital discord\u2014and it can be one of the toughest to resolve.\n\nThat\u2019s because when couples argue about how to spend money, they\u2019re not just debating the issue at hand, such as how much they can put on the credit card each month, or whether they can really afford that big vacation. They\u2019re giving voice to subconscious anxieties that even they may not be aware of\u2014and bumping up against the unarticulated fears of their partners.\n\nMaybe it was a childhood of poverty\u2014or just the constant fear of poverty\u2014that leaves a spouse hating to spend money. Maybe a first spouse\u2019s secret bank account now is causing distrust in a second marriage.\n\nEven benign past experiences can lead to unintended consequences years later. Dave Jetson, founder of Jetson Counseling in Rapid City, S.D., says that his first memory of money is getting a quarter from a cousin at age four or five. His mother immediately took it away for safekeeping, he says. \u201cHer heart and her intention were in the right place, but what that taught me was, the next time I get the money, I\u2019m going to spend it, because I don\u2019t want it taken away.\u201d\n\nHow do couples keep from stumbling over all that emotional baggage every time they need to talk about their bills or their budget? One place to start is to simply acknowledge that everyone reacts emotionally to money, and then take the time to find out what early memories may be driving each spouse\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cIf you realize that your spouse grew up in poverty and as a result of that they have this intense fear around not having enough money, all of a sudden their cheapness takes on an entirely new light,\u201d says Brad Klontz, a psychologist, certified financial planner and associate professor at Kansas State University.\n\nBut be warned: There are no hard-and-fast rules for predicting how specific events influence a person\u2019s approach to money. Mr. Klontz says he has seen people with the attitude, \u201cThere will never be enough money\u201d compulsively hoard cash. But he has also seen that attitude \u201clead to people who\u2019ve never saved a dime and they\u2019re in debt [because they think], \u2018There will never be enough, so why try?\u2019 It gets really specific. It\u2019s not an easy, \u2018You have this, so you do that.\u2019\u201d\n\nA couple who does the work of delving into their money patterns can gain understanding and potentially forestall arguments, and reach compromises. Here are five common areas of conflict, and how therapists work with couples to resolve them.\n\nHow do you handle it when one spouse is more of a spender, and the other more of a saver?\n\nThis is likely the most common source of financial tension in a relationship: One spouse tends to spend impulsively, without thought of the future, the other wants to scrimp as much as possible. The conflict can take many forms, but the roots\u2014and the solutions\u2014are rarely simple.\n\nMr. Klontz worked with one couple that was experiencing a clear conflict: The wife would suggest minor luxuries\u2014such as eating out\u2014only to find the husband reacting in anger.\n\nThe husband\u2019s irritation with his wife was rooted in a deep-seated fear, Mr. Klontz says. He grew up working class\u2014including a stint when his single mother was on public assistance\u2014and he was worried about ending up there again. \u201cHe grew up with a sense that there isn\u2019t enough, that we\u2019re poor and other people are rich,\u201d Mr. Klontz says, adding that he also has seen people from that type of background who squandered their money because they felt helpless, as though there will never be enough.\n\nIn this case, Mr. Klontz says, the husband had lived frugally prior to getting married, saving 40% of his income for retirement. Meanwhile, his house had few furnishings. \u201cHe had literally one plate, a fork, a knife,\u201d Mr. Klontz says.\n\nFor her part, the wife grew up in an upper-middle-class family. She was given a car for her 16th birthday, and she didn\u2019t have to work as a teenager. Her take on money? Everything will be all right. She was easygoing. She also hadn\u2019t saved a penny. There was time for that later. \u201cThat\u2019s a trap,\u201d Mr. Klontz says. \u201cIf you look at lifestyle inflation, when is there a surplus of money to start saving?\u201d\n\nPlus, he says, \u201cshe valued comfort.\u201d And those values ran up against her husband\u2019s fears. For example, early in the marriage, she wanted to buy a couch. That caused stress in the relationship. \u201cThere was a lot of conflict around money, because for every 1% she wanted to spend versus save, it caused him an anxiety attack,\u201d Mr. Klontz says. \u201cIn his family, nobody had saved. His extended family was on welfare. There was a lot of fear that would happen to him and his kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was very much driven out of fear,\u201d Mr. Klontz says. \u201cHe\u2019d become really intense in the conversation and she\u2019d be like, \u2018Geez, all I want to do is go out to dinner.\u2019 There was all this energy around it. And he saw her as not being on the same page on the importance of saving.\u201d\n\nThe solution? At first, learning how to listen. Mr. Klontz had each of them answer questions such as \u201cWhat\u2019s your biggest fear?\u201d and then had the other spouse repeat the answer exactly to make sure they were really paying attention to what the other was saying. Talking about their stories helped the couple shift from anger and blame to compassion, Mr. Klontz says. For the wife, it was, \u201cI get why you\u2019re so anxious,\u201d he says.\n\nThe husband was feeling defensive, but the conversation \u201chelped release it for him,\u201d Mr. Klontz says. He says the husband realized, \u201cI don\u2019t want to create a life of poverty for us. I want us to have nice things. A couch is more comfortable than foldout chairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe work for him was shifting his belief that \u2018there will never be enough\u2019 to one of \u2018we need a little bit more of a balanced approach.\u2019 As a financial planner and psychologist, it\u2019s really tough to say, \u2018You need to save less,\u2019 but that\u2019s actually what needed to happen,\u201d Mr. Klontz says. \u201cIf you looked at his life, it looked like he was very poor when in fact he wasn\u2019t. He was making money. For him, it was recognizing that his wife was providing him an opportunity to have a better life and not just save it all until he was 70.\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Klontz reviewed their long-term goals, the couple reached a compromise: The husband would reduce his savings rate to 20%\u2014their financial plan showed that to be adequate\u2014and the wife would start saving 20%. Also, the husband agreed that the wife could make spending decisions, such as buying a couch or planning a vacation.\n\nAnother helpful strategy: setting specific goals, says Amanda Clayman, a New York-based financial therapist. \u201cA big area where I see a lot of conflict is where people haven\u2019t defined what they actually want to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cThey spend all of their energy and focus critiquing the other person\u2019s point of view.\u201d\n\nSimply saying, \u201cWe\u2019re terrible savers. We need to save more,\u201d won\u2019t help a couple move forward, she says. Set a specific savings goal, she advises, and acknowledge how it will affect day-to-day spending.\n\nHow much money should you give an adult child?\n\nDisagreements over how much support to give an adult child can result in secrecy, with one parent providing money on the sly because the other parent insists it\u2019s time to cut off the child, says Susan Zimmerman, a licensed therapist and co-founder of Mindful Asset Planning in Minneapolis. \u201cThat\u2019s never a good situation to get into,\u201d she says.\n\nImagine, for example, a wife is giving money to her 26-year-old daughter, who has graduated from college and has a decent job but still runs out of money every month. The wife is not telling her husband about these gifts, because the husband feels it\u2019s time for the daughter to stand on her own two feet.\n\nMs. Zimmerman\u2019s first step is to make sure the couple agrees the secrecy is a problem that needs resolving. Then, she introduces the idea that giving too much can be harmful to the child\u2019s growth.\n\nHer goal is to help the couple come up with rules they can both live by, including how much money is acceptable to give, in what circumstances\u2014such as a job loss\u2014and for how long.\n\nMs. Zimmerman says that it\u2019s also important for the parent providing the support to understand why he or she is doing it. It may be entirely benign. But it also may be driven by a sense of discomfort from the fact that the parent doesn\u2019t like the child being mad at the parent.\n\nThe parent may have internalized the lesson early in childhood that \u201cI\u2019m only valuable or safe if I\u2019m pleasing everyone all the time,\u201d Ms. Zimmerman says. To keep everyone happy, that parent becomes secretive to avoid disapproval. \u201cIt\u2019s not unstressful, but it\u2019s less painful to that [person] than having anyone disapproving of me,\u201d she says.\n\nFor that parent, Ms. Zimmerman says, it\u2019s important to recognize the need to override that discomfort and focus on the more important objective: helping the child become financially responsible, and to remember that giving too much can create an unhealthy dependence.\n\nOne simple strategy for a couple struggling to discuss the issue: Each spouse writes down the amount they think is acceptable to give. When they reveal what they\u2019ve written, Ms. Zimmerman asks: \u201cWhere do you think that number came from?\u201d\n\nOften, the answer is related to a childhood memory, but it might also be an estimate of how much the spouse can spare every month. There is no wrong answer, she says, and every answer will help the spouses start to understand each other better.\n\nWhat do you do when spouses have different priorities on big-ticket spending?\n\nOne spouse wants to buy a new dining-room set; the other wants to go on a luxurious vacation. One wants to buy a sailboat; the other wants to renovate the house.\n\nSuch a conflict over big-ticket expenditures may arise because each spouse hears the same words, but interprets them differently. When the husband, for instance, says he wants a sailboat, Ms. Clayman says, in some cases he really is saying, \u201cI work hard. I deserve this.\u201d His wife, however, doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s behind her husband\u2019s desire because he isn\u2019t spelling it out.\n\nThen, when she questions the logic of buying a huge discretionary item, his reaction is, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you think I deserve it?\u201d Ms. Clayman says. He doesn\u2019t want to explain what he\u2019s feeling on an emotional level, so he might say, \u201cI make enough to afford this.\u201d The subtext is: \u201cDon\u2019t argue with me about this.\u201d\n\nLikewise, the wife may feel a similar sense of entitlement when she argues for a home renovation. Or maybe there\u2019s a motive that stretches further back; perhaps she\u2019s constantly trying to outrun a childhood where she had very little. But, again, she doesn\u2019t spell any of that out, so when her husband questions the need for a renovation, she hears her husband\u2019s opposition as his rejecting her\u2014a common reaction when people face disapproval of their money choices. The wife, Ms. Clayman says, is feeling: \u201cYou don\u2019t see me. You don\u2019t care about my needs.\u201d\n\nThe key to compromise is affirming and validating your spouse\u2019s values and needs, experts say. Olivia Mellan, a money and relationships coach and author of books on money behavior, guides couples to use three steps: mirroring, validation and empathy. Mirroring, like Mr. Klontz\u2019s method, entails repeating back verbatim what the other spouse says about a money goal.\n\nThen the listener validates that point of view and considers what that spouse\u2019s emotional state might be. Here\u2019s how a spouse might validate and empathize with one who wants a sailboat: \u201cIt makes sense that you want a sailboat. You love the ocean, and that way you can be on the ocean as much as you want. I imagine you\u2019re feeling frustrated about how long you\u2019ve waited for a sailboat.\u201d\n\nThe process is repeated for the other spouse. That kind of conversation, Ms. Mellan says, is the gateway to compromise.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re stressed about something, you will always revert to your survival mode, which is always dysfunctional,\u201d Ms. Mellan says. \u201cThe fear mode is me against you. We are enemies. The thriving mode is the nonstress mode.\u201d\n\nHow do you do right by children from both sides of a blended family?\n\nBlended families are ripe for conflicts over money. The spouses typically come into it with different levels of savings and income. And they may have different ideas about how they want to treat their children. When those different attitudes collide, that can lead to heated struggles that force deep emotions to the surface.\n\nMr. Jetson offers an example, drawn from his work with Rick Kahler, a certified financial planner and founder of Kahler Financial Group in Rapid City, S.D.\n\nTwo spouses were struggling over how to divvy up the money among the stepchildren in an estate plan. (The couple did not have children together, but each had children from a previous marriage.) They had a prenuptial agreement that stipulated how their premarital assets would be divided, but the couple couldn\u2019t agree on how to allocate assets that they had acquired since they had been married.\n\nThe spouses had agreed to set up a trust such that, in the event of one spouse\u2019s death, the other would be supported, with the money going to all of the kids upon the second spouse\u2019s death. But there was a sticking point: The wife was worried that after her husband\u2019s death, his children would find a way to write her children out of the trust. \u201cShe was insisting her kids would get their share immediately upon his death, and the remainder [would go] to his kids upon her death,\u201d Mr. Kahler says.\n\nThe conflict, Mr. Jetson says, was less about money and more about emotional issues, stemming from a lack of trust. Deep down, the wife feared her husband cared more about his children than about her and her children. She was afraid that meant her children wouldn\u2019t be cared for.\n\nMr. Jetson helped the couple talk through the issues. \u201cWhen they got emotionally heard, the shift occurred, and it was a done deal,\u201d he says. Both spouses agreed that upon one spouse\u2019s death, the funds would to go into trust for the survivor\u2019s support and then be disseminated to the children equally after the surviving spouse\u2019s death.\n\nOther sources of conflict may go even deeper. For example, a father who, as a child, felt that a sibling was his parents\u2019 favorite might as an adult have a strong need for fairness, Mr. Jetson says. That can translate into a sharp focus on making sure that all of his children are bequeathed an equal amount of money in a will.\n\nBut that focus may bump up against his second wife\u2019s urge to lavish more on the children from the new marriage, because she believes her husband\u2019s previous wife should provide more monetary support for the children from the earlier marriage.\n\nHow do you manage conflict when one spouse controls the finances?\n\nArguments over who\u2019s controlling the money often occur because couples never discuss how they will make money decisions. Many fail to talk about money before they get married\u2014that\u2019s considered unromantic\u2014and after the wedding they fall into a pattern where one partner handles the finances, Ms. Zimmerman says.\n\nBut even though they\u2019re not talking about it, money decisions are getting made, and each spouse is proceeding with his or her unspoken expectations. For example, the spouse who handles the brokerage account might invest in high-risk stocks, while the other assumes the portfolio is well-diversified. After, say, a stock-market crash, arguments ensue.\n\n\u201cIf two individuals have conflicting expectations, then when they hit upon the first big disagreement it turns into an additional bullet point of confusion,\u201d Ms. Zimmerman says, adding that couples engage in \u201cmagical thinking.\u201d We love each other, so we must have the same goals.\n\nOften, the spouse who relinquishes control over the daily money management is the \u201csaver,\u201d says Ms. Clayman, the financial therapist. He or she doesn\u2019t pay attention to the daily spending, and then gets angry at the \u201cspender\u201d when things don\u2019t go according to his or her unspoken plan.\n\nConflicts can also arise when spouses have \u201ca fairly significant difference in their income and one believes, \u2018If I make more money, I get to have more decision-making power,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Zimmerman says.\n\nIn other cases, the spouse controlling the finances may engage in practices that baffle the other. Ms. Zimmerman recalls one couple where the wife was shocked to discover that her husband would throw bills away if they were short on money. \u201cThat was just beyond her imagination,\u201d Ms. Zimmerman says.\n\nEven what might be considered \u201cnormal\u201d money practices may surprise a spouse, because he or she grew up differently. But even if you\u2019re surprised at your spouse\u2019s behavior, it\u2019s important to keep the shock to a minimum, Ms. Zimmerman says. \u201cLet\u2019s look at this from a curiosity perspective rather than \u2018who\u2019s doing something wrong\u2019 perspective. The trick is to make sure to keep defensiveness to a minimum, if not completely nonexistent.\u201d\n\nShe asks couples to consider what money messages they received growing up, not so that they judge those experiences as good or bad, but to \u201creally help people learn about themselves on the money front,\u201d Ms. Zimmerman says. When clients divulge those money lessons, she then asks: \u201cIs that how you model your money behavior? In what way are you that way?\u201d\n\nMs. Coombes is a writer in San Francisco.

Jonathan F. Hillenbrand\n\nWhen it comes to surgery, patients may be ill-informed about the risks and benefits, and physically unfit to undergo procedures.\n\nNow hospitals are turning to interactive programs, Web portals and mobile apps to educate patients, both to improve their understanding and to protect against possible legal action if things go wrong. At the same time, surgeons\u2019 groups are developing new ways to evaluate whether patients are ready for surgery, and help them get into better shape to go under the knife.\n\nPatients over 45 account for the largest share of the more than 100 million inpatient and outpatient operations annually, and with age, many are dealing with conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and smoking-related lung disease. These put them at higher risk for complications both during and after the procedure.\n\nAnd many patients are flying blind into the operating room. A review of available evidence in the American Journal of Surgery in 2009 found that adequate overall understanding by patients of the various aspects of the informed-consent process that precedes a decision to have surgery was reported in less than one-third of studies.\n\nTime to Study Up\n\nEven when patients consider themselves well-informed, the review authors noted, it may not actually be the case, and patients with lower educational levels may feel embarrassed to ask questions or get better explanations. Also, patients don\u2019t always grasp the benefits of the surgery, reflecting an overall lack of understanding of their disease and potential complications.\n\nPart of a tutorial on gastric-bypass surgery. Emmi Solutions\n\nInformation on a lap-band procedure. Emmi Solutions\n\nUnless it\u2019s an emergency, most surgeries are considered elective, which means there is plenty of time to learn about an operation and make sure it is the best treatment. But sometimes, it can be hard to absorb information without extra help.\n\n\u201cWhen I sit in my office, I can explain that there are complications like bleeding, infection and blood clots, but so much of that goes over their head, especially when they are hearing all the instructions like not eating or drinking anything before surgery,\u201d says Woody Denham, a gastrointestinal surgeon at NorthShore University HealthSystem, the teaching affiliate of the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine.\n\nBefore he meets with patients, Dr. Denham has them view interactive Web-based tutorials designed by Chicago based Emmi Solutions, which go through risks and benefits, how the procedure works, what to expect during surgery and what patients can do to stay healthy afterward. Patients can view the tutorials at their own pace on a computer or device at home, or in Dr. Denham\u2019s office.\n\nThe interactive graphics and simple pictures in the tutorials \u201creally help them gain an understanding of what\u2019s happening to them,\u201d Dr. Denham says. And while they don\u2019t replace the doctor-patient discussion about surgery and outcomes, he adds, patients who use the tutorials show a much better understanding and ask the right questions.\n\nInformed Choice\n\nPhil Vick, age 71, viewed tutorials last year on two different weight-loss surgery options, gastric-bypass surgery and a lap-band procedure. He says they enhanced his understanding of how the two procedures and their risks and benefits differed.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t even 100% sure I was going to do anything,\u201d he says, but as a diabetes patient, he was concerned about his future health and wanted to explore the possibilities for significant weight loss.\n\nHis wife watched with him, and they occasionally paused the tutorial to jot down questions for Dr. Denham and his staff. He decided the gastric-bypass surgery was the best option and had the procedure in January, after taking recommended steps to lose some weight. He has lost 80 pounds in total, and says, \u201cI\u2019m to the point where if I lost another 10 pounds that would be all I would want to lose.\u201d\n\nSome organizations have programs to instruct patients in skills they will need after surgery. The American College of Surgeons offers a video-based tutorial to help ostomy patients\u2014those who will have a surgically created opening in the abdomen to allow waste to leave the body\u2014manage the condition and empty their bag at home. Another video guide helps patients prepare for recovery from a lung procedure, including pneumonia prevention.\n\nThe college also sponsors a program in Washington state, Strong for Surgery, that focuses on the crucial preoperative period. Started in 2012, the program uses checklists for initial consultations between doctors and patient that focus on smoking, nutrition, blood-sugar control and medication. Smoking, for example, can impair the ability to withstand anesthesia, increase the risk of respiratory complications after surgery (such as pneumonia) and interfere with wound healing.\n\nToday, 185 surgeons are part of Strong for Surgery, and more than 2,500 patients have been evaluated with the checklist, according to the program\u2019s medical director, Thomas Varghese. The plan now, he adds, is to spread the idea nationally.\n\nThe program also offers patients interactive tools to help with smoking cessation, which \u201callow patients to assess their level of motivation to quit, set a quit date and then institute their plan,\u201d Dr. Varghese says.\n\nHelping Yourself\n\nSome surgeons are also turning to apps that crunch big data to help patients understand their personal risks of complications from surgery. B. Todd Heniford, chief of the division of gastrointestinal and minimally invasive surgery at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, N.C., developed a free app for patients considering hernia surgery. It has been downloaded in more than 50 countries since it was introduced in 2012. The app compares individual patient factors with data from a continuing study of hernia patients to provide personalized predictions on the chances of experiencing chronic pain and discomfort after an operation. (More than 30% of patients may suffer pain after hernia repair, from damage to nerves and muscles or from mesh used to reinforce the abdominal wall.)\n\nDr. Heniford\u2019s group recently introduced another app that helps show patients how\u2014by controlling smoking, diabetes and obesity\u2014they can significantly affect their own outcomes, specifically with wound-related complications.\n\n\u201cSurgeons often tell patients, you need to stop smoking, control your diabetes or lose weight, but patients often have no idea what preparing themselves for surgery with these variables in mind truly means,\u201d Dr. Heniford says. The technology provides \u201cthe first real mechanism through which we can show people what their effort can do for their health, risk of postoperative complications and cost.\u201d\n\nMs. Landro is a Wall Street Journal assistant managing editor in New York and writes the Informed Patient column.

Did I incur some unexpected tax costs from this move?\n\nNo, says Thomas Morgan, a director in BlackRock Inc. \u2019s U.S. wealth-advisory business, who deals with 529s. The accounts allow for a change of ownership, he says: \u201cThis can be accomplished without any tax, cost, penalty or fee imposed by the program or under applicable tax laws.\u201d\n\nWhat will change for your family is that the accounts will be considered differently if the student applies for college financial aid. Accounts owned by a parent are considered part of the family\u2019s assets, although at a discounted rate, while accounts owned by other adults, including grandparents, don\u2019t count against the student until money is withdrawn to pay for educational expenses.\n\nAt that point, the money is considered income to the student and may reduce the financial-aid package.\n\nCan a non-U.S. resident or noncitizen fund a 529?\n\nYes, Mr. Morgan says: Any adult who is a U.S. citizen or resident alien can start an account. Check to make certain you comply with state residency requirements for the plan you choose.\n\nYou and the beneficiary will both need a valid Social Security number, says Derek DeLorenzo, senior vice president of Ascensus College Savings, the country\u2019s largest 529 administrator. Once the account is set up, most plans allow contributions to come from anyone, not just the owner, but contributors lose control over how the money is invested or distributed, Mr. Morgan says.\n\nYears ago, I set up a 529 for my grandchildren. Luckily, their parents are now able to take care of their college expenses, so this money isn\u2019t needed. Can I use it myself, to take college courses or do travel-study programs run by universities\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll need to switch the account\u2019s designated beneficiary to yourself. That\u2019s permitted because you are a direct relative\u2014the grandparent\u2014of the original beneficiary.\n\nOnce you do that, you can make distributions for qualified educational expenses (tuition, fees, room and board, costs of books and supplies) at eligible institutions. That list includes public and private colleges, graduate programs, community colleges and certain vocational schools.\n\nIf a school participates in an Education Department financial-aid program, it is generally eligible for 529 payments; check at www.fafsa.ed.gov. \u201cMany study-abroad programs approved for credit by an eligible educational institution are qualified expenses,\u201d Mr. Morgan says.\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe question of whether the beneficiary of a 529 account can use the money for travel programs that are run by a university but not part of a degree program is one you should ask the university\u2019s financial-aid office, since it might depend on the school and the program, Mr. DeLorenzo says.\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

Shown, graduation at University North Carolina Wilmington last year. Photo: Matt Born/Associated Press\n\nMany parents and grandparents love \u201c529\u201d accounts to save for college. But like anything involving money and taxes, not everyone uses them in the most efficient way.\n\nThese state-sponsored savings plans, which typically invest in mutual funds, hold a record amount of assets\u2014$258.2 billion in 12.3 million open accounts, says the College Savings Plans Network, a state treasurers\u2019 group.\n\nThe attraction is that they come with years of tax-free growth, as well as tax-free withdrawals as long as the funds are used to pay for qualified education expenses.\n\nIn effect, these plans are a hedge against the wave of student-loan debt engulfing many recent graduates.\n\n\u201cIt is much less expensive to save for college than to borrow for college,\u201d says Angie O\u2019Leary, senior vice president with U.S. Bancorp Investments.\n\nHere are some tips from consultants and other experts on how to use these plans in the best way:\n\n1. Fund to the max\n\nWhile it is never too late to start a college-savings plan, try to fund your 529 account to the maximum that you are able to as quickly as you can after a child is born. Or at least put aside a manageable amount regularly.\n\nThe average 529 account size nationally is $20,934, according to the College Savings Plans Network. Depending on the state, contribution limits typically don\u2019t kick in unless you\u2019re fortunate enough to hit $300,000 to $452,000.\n\nIf possible, take advantage of a provision that allows a parent or grandparent to make five years\u2019 worth of allowable contributions to a 529 all at once, using up their gift-tax reporting exemption for those years. The gift-tax exemption is $14,000 per beneficiary a year, meaning you could prefund a 529 up to $70,000, according to Ms. O\u2019Leary.\n\n\u201cIf you find yourselves in a windfall situation, maybe somebody dies and leaves you money, and you\u2019re a parent who hasn\u2019t started saving for college, take that money and put it away for the five years,\u201d says Andrea Feirstein, a 529 consultant to states who runs AKF Consulting Group in New York.\n\n2. Go online for withdrawals\n\nMany 529 plans are set up to make payments to universities directly, online. With a few clicks, the 529 assets that you choose to use that year are sent directly to the school.\n\nIf that option is available, it is not only quick, but ideal for your record-keeping: It avoids any question with the Internal Revenue Service that the distributions were used properly on educational expenses. Of course, it is always a good idea to check with the school first, to be certain such a direct electronic payment won\u2019t cause any problem with financial aid.\n\nIt is also smart to automate your 529 contributions. The automatic-contribution feature that many plans have will pull money from your paycheck or checking account regularly. Even $50 a month will add up.\n\nRemoving the element of choice should boost your college-savings rate, since most investors will tend to leave these direct deductions in place once they are set.\n\n3. Tips for grandparents\n\nGrandparents often start 529s to back their grandchildren\u2019s college dreams. But there are a few things families need to consider before tapping these accounts.\n\nAssets held in grandparent-owned 529 plans don\u2019t count toward a family\u2019s expected contribution on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or Fafsa, the form colleges use to determine eligibility for federal financial aid. Distributions from those accounts, however, are treated as student income, so they will weigh heavily in financial-aid calculations. According to Ms. O\u2019Leary, student income is assessed at 50%, meaning if a grandparent pays $5,000 of college costs it could reduce the student\u2019s eligibility for aid the next year by $2,500.\n\nThat is why some families, if they can, wait until the student\u2019s junior year of college, after the final Fafsa has been filed, to take distributions from grandparent-owned accounts.\n\nHowever, a change is coming that will make it easier for grandparents to help out with costs earlier.\n\nStarting in the 2017-18 school year, the income information students report on the Fafsa will be from two years back instead of one, as is the case now. That means grandparents will be able to contribute to a child\u2019s educational expenses as early as sophomore year, after the second-to-last Fafsa has been filed, without affecting the student\u2019s eligibility for aid, Ms. O\u2019Leary says.\n\nAnother issue for grandparents is making sure they appoint a successor to own their 529 accounts should they die before the money is used.\n\nIt is a good idea, Ms. Feirstein says; otherwise it isn\u2019t clear whether the money you used to fund the account will still be considered a gift that has permanently left your estate.\n\nWhen the account-holder changes, however, the beneficiary could see some changes in financial-aid eligibility, she says, because parental- and student-owned assets, including those in 529s, are reportable on the Fafsa. If ownership of the 529 goes to a parent, for example, 5.64% of the assets in the account will be counted in the financial-aid calculation, Ms. O\u2019Leary says.\n\nOn the other hand, qualified distributions from parent- and student-owned accounts don\u2019t have to be reported as student income.\n\n4. When a 529 isn\u2019t best\n\nA 529 account may not make sense for everyone, especially if estate and gift taxes are a concern.\n\nGrandparents who can spare the money up front might want to fund educational expenses directly, says Adrienne Penta, a Boston-based senior vice president and regional trust head at Brown Brothers Harriman\u2019s private-banking division. Wealth-management clients at Brown Brothers Harriman have at least $10 million at the bank and often upward of $25 million, so writing a $60,000 tuition check to a university usually isn\u2019t a problem.\n\nAsk Us a Question Have a question about college finance in general? We\u2019ll be answering them in future funds reports.

Typical distributions from her 529 take two to three weeks to post directly to her school account. Can I initiate the direct payment in mid-December of the previous calendar year, or will it cause a mismatch of potential qualified expenses?\n\nTry to avoid making a distribution in December and paying the tuition in January, since the mismatch will cause record-keeping problems for your taxes. \u201cThe solution is for the parent to pay the tuition directly to the school and then request reimbursement from the tuition plan,\u201d says Robert Keebler, a certified public accountant in Green Bay, Wis.\n\nRules for 529s, the popular state-sponsored plans in which earnings are tax-free if used for college expenses, allow people who pay tuition bills directly to reimburse themselves from the 529. Just be sure to \u201chave good documentation that the expense is at least as much as the distribution,\u201d says Zachary Shrier, a financial adviser at Shrier Wealth Management in Los Angeles.\n\nThe easiest way to handle this is to establish a direct-payment link between your 529 and your checking account, allowing you to transfer money between the accounts within two to three days, he says: \u201cIf that is set up in advance, you can request the money at the beginning of the year, have the money quickly, and write a check to the university.\u201d\n\nHow do 529 plans work for stepparents, custodians, cousins, great-aunts or any adult who isn\u2019t a child\u2019s parent?\n\nA 529 can be opened for anyone, by anyone. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the account-holding adult is related to the beneficiary. Tax rules let you give $14,000 this year to anyone without triggering the gift-tax reporting requirement (a couple can give $28,000). For 529s, you can deposit $70,000 at once ($140,000 for a couple) and have it count as your tax-free gift to the beneficiary for the next five years.\n\nA possible drawback: Only relatives of the original beneficiary can use the account\u2019s funds, so if your friend\u2019s daughter decides not to go to college, the account you\u2019ve established for her can be transferred only to her relatives, not yours.\n\nYou might want to write the child\u2019s parents a check for deposit in a 529 they set up, says Lindsay Bourkoff, also a financial adviser at Shrier Wealth. In many ways, it\u2019s easier to make a third-party contribution, she says, although you don\u2019t get the tax deduction that a 529 owner would receive. It still helps the child, and you don\u2019t assume the responsibility of funding and managing the plan. In a lot of states, for instance in California, there are no state tax benefits to owning your own plan.\n\nBefore setting up a 529, check on state requirements. \u201cSome plans might limit participation to state residents,\u201d says Mr. Keebler.\n\nBeware of how this could affect financial-aid eligibility. A parent-owned 529 must be disclosed on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or Fafsa, form, though it is measured at a preferred rate. An account owned instead by another adult doesn\u2019t have to be disclosed. But when a beneficiary takes a distribution from any 529, that amount is disclosed on the following year\u2019s Fafsa, which will factor into aid calculations, says Mr. Shrier.\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nIf a parent receives a direct distribution from a plan by depositing it in his or her checking account and then simultaneously writes a check to the college for tuition, will this create a taxable event to the parent?\n\nAs long as equivalent funds are used for qualified education expenses, you shouldn\u2019t incur tax. Be sure to keep all documents: credit-card statements or checks showing that you paid tuition, or receipts from a university. \u201cThe key here is careful record-keeping on the part of the 529 account-holder,\u201d Ms. Bourkoff says.\n\nAt the end of the year, your 529 provider will issue a 1099-Q, showing the sums distributed from the account. You don\u2019t have to itemize those amounts, but if you get audited, you must be able to show where the money went.\n\nThe more common way to handle these transfers is to \u201cwrite the tuition check and then request a distribution from the 529 plan,\u201d Mr. Keebler says, which allows you to make sure you are also claiming whatever education tax benefits are due to you on your 1040. Be careful: \u201cYou can\u2019t double dip\u2014that is, claim an education benefit on your tax return and pay the tuition with a 529 plan distribution,\u201d he says.\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

We once again asked college-finance experts to answer some of the recent questions.\n\nMy daughter is enrolled in a physician-assistant program. She attends school in Chicago, but is doing her residency in New Orleans. She must return to school in Chicago to take her exams. Can I use \u201c529\u201d-account money to purchase her airline tickets?\n\nThe short answer is yes, but transportation costs don\u2019t count as a qualified education expense, meaning you will have to pay tax plus a 10% penalty on the earnings portion of any 529 college-savings funds you use to pay for airline tickets.\n\nThere is a chance, however, that a portion of the withdrawal won\u2019t be subject to that treatment: \u201cPart of the distribution will likely be from the basis, or what you contributed, and wouldn\u2019t be subject to taxes or a penalty,\u201d says J.J. Montanaro, a financial planner with USAA in San Antonio. What\u2019s more, you can always challenge a decision to count the tickets as a nonqualified expense, says Russell Rivera, a financial adviser and president of Voice Wealth Management in New York City. Such an appeal might succeed, he says, if the school requires travel as part of the program.\n\nMy daughter has received financial aid based on my income totaling about $30,000 a year. Her grandmother has since offered to give $10,000 toward her college education each year. Can she pay the school directly, or should she give me the money and I will use it for payments in the current year? How will this affect future years?\n\nIt depends on the family\u2019s objective: maximizing financial aid or minimizing taxes. If the grandmother makes a tuition payment to the school, your daughter will have to report this payment on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or Fafsa, which will affect her aid for the following year. The payment, however, won\u2019t count against the grandmother\u2019s federal gift-tax reporting exemption, notes Mr. Montanaro. If the grandmother instead gives the money to you and you use it to pay tuition, the $10,000 will count toward the grandmother\u2019s gift-tax reporting exemption, which is $14,000 per person a year, but the gift won\u2019t have to be reported on the Fafsa.\n\nPhoto: iStock/Getty Images\n\n\u201cAnother option would be for her grandmother to save the money until after your daughter graduates, at which time she can use the money to help pay off any loans that might have been taken out,\u201d Mr. Rivera says.\n\nI have young grandchildren for whom I\u2019ve been contributing to 529 plans. I was surprised to see that a grandparent-owned 529 will count 100% on the Fafsa form, but parent-owned 529s at 15%. Can I transfer ownership to the parents now without a tax consequence for anyone?\n\nActually, grandparent-owned college-savings accounts don\u2019t count in Fafsa aid calculations, although they are included in the CSS Profile, which is the form many colleges use to calculate a student\u2019s eligibility for need-based institutional aid. Parent-owned 529s do count on Fafsa, at 5.64%, Mr. Rivera says.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem, he says: \u201cWithdrawals from grandparent-owned college savings plans and given to the student or school on the student\u2019s behalf can reduce aid eligibility by up to 50% in the year following the distribution.\u201d\n\nYou can get around this by waiting until the last year and a half of the student\u2019s college years to use distributions from your 529 plan, Mr. Rivera says. Alternatively, the assets could be used to pay back the student\u2019s loans after graduation. But because student loans don\u2019t count as a qualified education expense, you typically will face taxes and penalties on the earnings portion, so consult with a tax adviser first.\n\nIf you decide to switch ownership of your plan, check with your tax adviser on how your future contributions will count, and realize that the plan will affect financial aid, albeit in a less-dramatic way, as a parental asset, Mr. Montanaro says.\n\nWould a $5,000 loan to the student, or the parents, have the same impact as a gift\u2014that is, be reportable on Fafsa and, like a gift, affect the student\u2019s expected contribution for future years?\n\nGifts and loans to parents don\u2019t have to be reported on the Fafsa, but gifts and loans to students do and could affect financial aid, Mr. Rivera says, explaining that loans are seen as a form of cash support.\n\n\u201cBetter strategies for a grandparent might include waiting until graduation to help pay off any accrued student loans, paying expenses in the later years of college, or perhaps even cosigning student loans, if you are so inclined to do so,\u201d Mr. Rivera says.\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

And that wealth transfer raises lots of questions on how to navigate the tricky world of college financing.\n\nTo help readers understand the regulations governing college aid and the tax implications, we once again have tapped experts for their advice and insights. Read on for reader questions and expert answers on paying for college.\n\nCan a grandparent pay for a grandchild\u2019s college tuition and still be able to give a $14,000 gift to cover other expenses?\n\nYes, but there are some important caveats.\n\n\u201cAnyone can pay college tuition directly to the institution and still be able to make a gift of $14,000 to their grandchild\u2026without affecting their annual gift-tax exclusion for that individual,\u201d says James Canup, partner and chairman of the tax practice at the Hirschler Fleischer law firm in Richmond, Va. That $14,000 is the maximum a grandparent generally can give to each grandchild in one year without having to report it for federal gift-tax purposes (although having to report a gift doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that tax will be due).\n\nAsk Us a Question Have a college-finance question? We\u2019ll be answering them in future funds reports. Send them to reports@wsj.com.\n\nTwo important things to keep in mind: First, tuition is the operative word in the reader\u2019s question, experts say. The grandparent\u2019s payment must be for tuition at a qualified institution\u2014not room, not board, not books.\n\nSecond, the tuition payment must be made directly to the institution by the giver, according to experts. The funds can\u2019t go to the student, the parents or anyone else except the college. Grandparents, make that check payable to the bursar.\n\nExperts also caution that helping a grandchild out this way could lessen the amount of need-based financial aid the student receives. Some schools treat direct tuition payments as \u201ccash support,\u201d says Mark Kantrowitz, senior vice president and publisher of college-planning website Edvisors.com. Such support has to be reported on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or Fafsa, and could reduce aid eligibility by as much as half, Mr. Kantrowitz says.\n\nIf a child borrows money for college, can a grandparent use a \u201c529\u201d account to pay off the loan after graduation?\n\nBeware if you\u2019re considering wading into this area. The answer is yes, no and maybe.\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind a potentially large tax hit, the answer is yes, because a grandparent (or anyone) could theoretically do anything with the funds in a 529 college-savings plan.\n\nIf you want to avoid a tax hit, the answer is no. Loan payments aren\u2019t among the qualified higher-education expenses for which 529 accounts can be used without triggering tax penalties.\n\n\u201cAlthough it\u2019s understandable to assume that student loans resulted from qualified higher-education expenses over time, the fact of the matter is that the IRS views the repayment of loans as a nonqualified expense,\u201d says Andy Hickman, co-founder of college-planning website College Quest Alliance LLC, of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s treatment of such 529 distributions.\n\nAs such, the earnings portion of a distribution from a grandparent\u2019s 529 account to repay college loans would need to be reported as taxable income and would be subject to a 10% tax penalty.\n\nAs for the maybe, there is a potential exception to the rule: \u201cIf a student received any tax-free scholarships, withdrawals from the 529 equaling the amount of these scholarships may be withdrawn from the 529 without penalty,\u201d Mr. Hickman says.\n\nI am paying for my granddaughter\u2019s college tuition, but she will pay me back with a small interest charge. Will she be able to deduct this interest on her taxes and, if so, what kind of documentation does she need to support the deduction?\n\nGrandparents who want to pay for their grandchild\u2019s tuition have to keep some details in mind. Photo: iStock/Getty Images\n\nNo. While it might be tempting to deduct college-loan interest paid to the Bank of Granny & Gramps, in order for student loans to qualify for a tax deduction they cannot come from a broad range of people and groups considered \u201cfamily.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe IRS is fairly clear that a qualified student loan is not one which comes from a \u2018related person,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Hickman says.\n\nIn addition to grandparents, people defined as related by the IRS include those you would expect, such as spouses, siblings and children. But the group also includes half-siblings and even certain corporations, partnerships and trusts.\n\nFor more information on qualified student loans and the rules governing interest deductions, go to irs.gov and search for Publication 970 (\u201cTax Benefits for Education\u201d) or call 800-829-3676 on weekdays to request a copy.\n\nMr. Hershberg is a Wall Street Journal news editor in New York.

But after just a few months of seeing reader questions and tracking down answers, I\u2019ve come to realize that the save-and-forget mentality doesn\u2019t begin to deal with the host of challenges faced by any parent or grandparent hoping to contribute toward a child\u2019s college education.\n\nIn particular, all sorts of decisions we make long before college begins\u2014or even before a child is born\u2014can affect aid eligibility, taxes and more.\n\nThis month, we have once again tapped experts for their advice and insights to help readers understand these challenges. Read on for experts\u2019 answers.\n\nTo help my grandchild with college costs, I am planning to transfer $5,000 a year directly into his bank account just before school starts to avoid affecting his financial-aid and scholarship package. Is this a viable plan?\n\nNo, not in the way you hope.\n\nWhile such generosity wouldn\u2019t have an effect on the student\u2019s first year of school because the Free Application for Federal Student Aid uses the prior year\u2019s income in its formula, college-planning experts say it would have to be reported as income on subsequent years\u2019 Fafsa forms and would affect the student\u2019s expected financial contribution going forward.\n\nThe $5,000 given to a student must be reported on Fafsa as \u201cmoney received or paid on student\u2019s behalf,\u201d according to P.J. Walsh, a certified financial planner who runs his own firm in Chicago. \u201cThe first $5,000 would not have an effect on his first year of school,\u201d Mr. Walsh says, \u201cbut would have to be reported as income on the next year\u2019s Fafsa form, affecting his expected contribution for his second year of college.\u201d\n\nHowever, experts note there is a sort of backdoor option to contribute to a student in his or her graduation year. \u201cYou could wait to help pay for your grandson\u2019s tuition until the second semester of his junior year, after he\u2019s already filed his last Fafsa,\u201d says Joe Hurley, a certified public accountant and founder of savingforcollege.com in Pittsford, N.Y.\n\nI have 25 Series E U.S. savings bonds that no longer gain interest. Would it be a tax write-off to use them to pay tuition for my grandchildren directly to a qualified institution?\n\nSorry, that isn\u2019t possible in this scenario because they don\u2019t qualify for the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s education savings-bond program. That program allows a tax exemption on some or all of a savings bond\u2019s interest, but there are many guidelines and restrictions:\n\n\u2022 The exemption is applicable only on Series EE bonds issued after 1989 or Series I bonds, and the bonds must be in your name or the name of you and your spouse. And the bonds\u2019 owner must have been at least 24 years old before the bond\u2019s issue date.\n\n\u2022 Redeemed funds must be used to pay qualified higher-education expenses for yourself, your spouse or a dependent you claim as an exemption on your tax return. And the qualified expenses don\u2019t include expenses for room and board or courses that aren\u2019t part of a degree- or certificate-granting program.\n\n\u2022 Your modified adjusted gross income, or MAGI, must be \u201cless than the amount specified for your filing status,\u201d the IRS says in its parlance. Or, plainly said, if you make too much money, you\u2019ll have to pay taxes on otherwise eligible savings bonds.\n\nAccording to Mr. Hurley, for 2015 \u201cthe tax exclusion is phased out for individuals with a MAGI between $77,200 and $92,200, or $115,750 and $145,750 for married couples filing jointly.\u201d The IRS also says your filing status can\u2019t be married filing separately to qualify.\n\n\u201cSince these are series E bonds\u2026they would not be eligible for this exclusion, and even if they were EE or I bonds, you would also be excluded based on the immediate-family stipulation,\u201d Mr. Walsh says.\n\nReaders who would like to explore the Education Savings Bond Program in greater detail should review IRS Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education.\n\nMr. Hershberg is a Wall Street Journal news editor in New York.

(You can read those past columns here: March column, April column, May column.)\n\nRead on for more reader questions and expert answers on paying for college:\n\nIf a grandparent pays a student\u2019s tuition directly to a nonprofit college, there is no gift tax. Can the grandparent include the tuition payment as a deductible contribution on his or her 1040?\n\nIt\u2019s true the gift tax doesn\u2019t apply when a grandparent\u2014or anyone\u2014pays a student\u2019s tuition directly to the school. But tuition payments can\u2019t be deducted, says Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst with Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting U.S., in Riverwoods, Ill. While a donation to a nonprofit school as part of its fundraising drive might qualify as a tax deduction as long as the donor didn\u2019t receive a benefit, tuition payments fail that \u201cbenefit\u201d test, because the student\u2019s education costs are reduced as a result of the payment.\n\nAsk Us a Question Have a college-finance question? We\u2019ll be answering them in future funds reports. Send them to reports@wsj.com.\n\nSuch payments also can cause a hit to the student\u2019s financial-aid award. \u201cA direct payment to a college by anybody other than the student\u2019s custodial parent or parents will count as cash support,\u201d which is reported as untaxed income on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or Fafsa, says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Edvisors.com, a consumer-information website based in Las Vegas. \u201cThis can have a severe negative impact on eligibility for need-based financial aid.\u201d\n\nI start grad school next year. I converted my 401(k) holdings into a rollover IRA. I can continue making contributions, and next year draw from the IRA penalty-free. I\u2019ll be using all of the IRA dollars, $40,000, for my first year of tuition. Is this a good savings strategy?\n\nThere\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with this strategy, says Victoria Rogers, a certified financial planner with Schneider Downs Wealth Management Advisors in Pittsburgh. But there are reasons why paying education expenses with IRA withdrawals isn\u2019t often advocated. For one, you\u2019ll owe income tax on the IRA distribution, unless contributions were after-tax.\n\nAlso, the income might have a negative impact on your financial-aid application.\n\nPerhaps most important, tapping an IRA for education expenses can have a big impact on your retirement savings. If you are age 30, that $40,000 in your IRA, without additional contributions, could grow to about $411,000 by age 70, assuming a 6% rate of return, Ms. Rogers notes.\n\nAnother option is to borrow. Education is an investment for which the cost of a loan might be justified, says Joe Jennings, investment director with PNC Wealth Management in Baltimore. \u201cWhat impact [will] this graduate degree have on your career and on your ability to increase your income over time? If it does have a meaningful impact, taking out a loan is a productive strategy.\u201d\n\nIf the parent owns the 529, can a grandparent, aunt or uncle make contributions directly, or must the donation be made to the parent to deposit in the 529 plan?\n\nThat depends. Many 529 programs allow contributions from people who don\u2019t own the account, but some don\u2019t, says James Canup, partner and chairman of the tax practice at Hirschler Fleischer in Richmond, Va. Check the 529 plan\u2019s rules.\n\nThen, if you know the account number, simply send a check to the plan, says Joseph Hurley, founder of the website SavingforCollege.com. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know the account number, make out a check in the name of the plan and give the check to the parent to deposit.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t forget to ask about any state tax deductions, Mr. Canup adds. \u201cSome 529 programs that allow non-account-owners to make contributions also provide [that person] with a state tax deduction or credit, if they\u2019re a taxpayer in that state,\u201d he says. But most 529s that both allow nonowners to make contributions and offer a state tax deduction allot that deduction to the owner.\n\nDon\u2019t forget the gift-tax rules, which are the same for all contributors regardless of who owns the account, Mr. Hurley says. \u201cYour contribution is a gift from you to the account beneficiary, so be mindful of the $14,000 gift-tax annual exclusion and, for larger contributions, the five-year election,\u201d he says.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nI don\u2019t want to saddle my two children, now 13 and 10, with college loans. Does it makes sense to slow or reduce the amount I\u2019m currently saving for retirement? Should my wife return to work? Should I count on the grandparents leaving an inheritance?\n\nOur experts agree that counting on an inheritance isn\u2019t a good strategy. And the experts recommend against reducing one\u2019s retirement-saving rate. Many of them cite the adage: \u201cYou can borrow for college but you can\u2019t borrow for retirement.\u201d\n\nOne helpful exercise: Estimate how much you need in retirement savings and let that help dictate your options, Mr. Jennings says. \u201cDoing that analysis can lead to a more concrete conclusion. You should be saving X dollars a month for retirement and then you can save Y number of dollars for the tuition.\u201d\n\nAnother tip: Consider community college for the first two years. \u201cCommunity colleges are a tremendous opportunity that too many families are not taking a look at,\u201d says Gary Carpenter, a CPA and owner of College Planning Services in Syracuse. On job interviews, the employer \u201cis not going to look at all the colleges they\u2019ve gone to. They\u2019re going to look at the college they graduated from.\u201d\n\nAs for student loans, in moderation they can help \u201cmake the students partially responsible for their education,\u201d Ms. Rogers says. She also agreed the wife should consider a part-time job. \u201cI did that myself when my children were in school,\u201d she says.\n\nIf a grandchild is in the custody of the grandparent, how does that affect the 529?\n\nIf the grandparent has legally adopted the child, then the grandparent is the child\u2019s parent as far as the Fafsa is concerned, Mr. Kantrowitz says. If the grandparent merely has custody and it isn\u2019t court-ordered\u2014for example, the parents asked an attorney to draw up a document giving the grandparent custody of the child\u2014the grandparent isn\u2019t a parent for federal student-aid purposes, he says.\n\n\u201cIf, however, there was a court-ordered legal guardianship, then that grandchild is actually considered an independent student for federal student-aid purposes,\u201d says Mr. Kantrowitz. In that case, parent-owned 529s and grandparent-owned 529s are treated the same. \u201cThey are not reported as an asset on the Fafsa. Any distributions will count as untaxed income to the student.\u201d\n\nMs. Coombes is a writer in San Francisco.

Each month we answer some of the most common and interesting questions.\n\nAmong the questions this month: Why use any of the various tax-advantaged plans (such as 529s and Coverdell accounts)? That is, if you earn enough or have enough savings to cover tuition costs\u2014something many parents dream of\u2014why not simply give your children the money? Read on for experts\u2019 answers to that question and others.\n\nWhy not just gift the money for college to your children?\n\nA reader and his wife have a 19-year-old in college and a 17-year-old in high school. Can each parent give $14,000 a year to each child, and let them pay for their tuition, room and board, and expenses? Seems too easy, the reader says.\n\nThe reader is referring to the annual gift-tax exemption; you can give up to $14,000 to another individual without being required to report the gift. A direct gift has the benefit of avoiding the complex rules that govern college-savings plans. And, up until the parents make the gift, they have complete control over how to invest that money, as opposed to being limited to a 529 plan\u2019s investment menu.\n\nAsk Us a Question Have a college-finance question? We\u2019ll be answering them in future funds reports. Send them to reports@wsj.com.\n\nPlus, for a high-net-worth family, gifting money is one way to reduce their estate for estate-tax purposes, says Michael Eisenberg, a personal-financial specialist and CPA with Miller Ward & Co.\n\nStill, gifting comes with problems of its own. For one, Mr. Eisenberg says, \u201cif it\u2019s an attempt to lower income or to reduce the estate for estate-tax purposes, you might as well just pay the tuition directly. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me to gift to the kids.\u201d He adds that parents eager to minimize estate taxes could pay tuition and give money to the children.\n\nIf tuition tops $28,000 a year (requiring each parent to gift more than $14,000), tax-reporting rules come into play. But perhaps most problematic: A gift can mean sacrificing the tax benefits of other strategies.\n\nThe question to ask is, \u201cWhat are you trying to accomplish by moving money from you to the kid?\u201d Mr. Eisenberg says.\n\nOthers agree. If a family has the resources, \u201cthen, yes, it can be a lot simpler to just give their children the money,\u201d says Frank Par\u00e9, a certified financial planner and president of PF Wealth Management Group in Oakland, Calif. \u201cThe key question is whether there are better ways to give, spend, or invest or save their money.\u201d\n\nOne strategy is to purchase a cash-value life-insurance policy when the student is young, allowing its value to grow over time. \u201cWhen the child goes to college, theoretically there\u2019s enough money there for the parents to take that tax-free to pay for college,\u201d Mr. Par\u00e9 says.\n\nAnother strategy: A parent who owns a business might hire the student and let her earn her college tuition through work\u2014the business owner can deduct wages as an expense. Saving for college in a Coverdell account is another option, but with even tighter restrictions than a 529 plan, such accounts are unlikely to appeal to this reader.\n\nWith all college-funding strategies, the effect on the prospects for financial aid are another question. That is not an issue for this gift-giver, at least with regard to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or Fafsa. Gifts to a dependent student from the student\u2019s parent aren\u2019t reported on the Fafsa as untaxed income, but are counted as a child asset if unspent.\n\n\u201cSo, there should be no impact on aid eligibility if the gift occurs after the Fafsa is filed,\u201d says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Edvisors.com, a consumer-information website in Las Vegas.\n\nAre there penalties on 529s if the student doesn\u2019t go to college?\n\nA grandparent of a child with a learning disability worries about penalties if the child doesn\u2019t go to college or a vocational school.\n\nIn that case, 529 distributions will be considered disqualified and will be subject to tax no matter what. But if the student qualifies as disabled, the 10% penalty will be waived, says James Canup, partner and chairman of the tax practice at Hirschler Fleischer in Richmond, Va.\n\nOne option for the grandparents is to change the 529 plan beneficiary to another family member.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nKeep in mind that special-needs services for beneficiaries in college are a qualified expense for 529 plans, Mr. Canup says. The problem is that the IRS hasn\u2019t provided clear definitions of \u201cspecial needs.\u201d But thanks to the advent of the new 529 Able accounts\u2014aimed specifically at disabled beneficiaries, though with different rules than traditional 529s\u2014these definitions may be coming.\n\nThe reader also asked: Will the fact that we knew he was disabled when we opened the plan, cause us problems? \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Canup says.\n\nWith a year to go in college, a grandparent\u2019s 529 has more than one year of college tuition in it\u2014what then?\n\nOur April column noted that distributions from a grandparent-owned 529 plan count as income to the student on the Fafsa, so one grandparent strategy is to wait to distribute the money until after the student\u2019s final Fafsa is filed.\n\nIf there is too much left in the account, one option is to let the extra money sit there, on the chance the student will go on to graduate school. Or consider changing beneficiaries to another family member.\n\nFailing those options, the grandparent could transfer ownership of the 529 plan to the student\u2019s parent. But check the rules, as some states and plans restrict transfers. Or, the grandparent could start distributions earlier in the student\u2019s college career, even though that risks dinging the student\u2019s financial-aid award. Finally, the grandparent can distribute the money for nonqualified expenses; income taxes and a 10% penalty will apply.\n\nThe reader also asks if the distributions from the 529 can be made payable to either the school or the student-loan organization. Student-loan payments aren\u2019t a qualified expense, says Mr. Kantrowitz. \u201cYou can have the distribution sent to the school,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s not going to make a difference.\u201d Money paid to the school versus money paid to the school through a grandparent, parent or student is still going to be treated as a distribution for the benefit of that student.\n\nHow do 529s owned by aunts and uncles affect financial aid?\n\nA parent-owned plan is counted as an asset and will reduce the financial-aid package by 5.64% of plan assets, but distributions from such plans aren\u2019t counted as income. While a grandparent-owned plan is ignored as an asset, distributions from such a plan are counted as income to the student and can cut the aid by as much as half the amount of the distribution.\n\nSo, what about 529 plans owned by other people? \u201cIt\u2019s the same as for grandparents,\u201d Mr. Kantrowitz says. If it\u2019s owned by the student or the dependent student\u2019s parent, it\u2019s a reportable asset and distributions are ignored. If it\u2019s owned by anybody else, it\u2019s not reported as an asset on the Fafsa, and because of that, any untaxed distributions are treated as income to the student,\u201d he says.\n\nMs. Coombes is a writer in San Francisco.

Photo: Lauren Sykes/University of St Andrews\n\nAs the cost of college in the U.S. soars to record levels, American students in growing numbers are enrolling in schools abroad, where tuition fees are substantially lower\u2014and in some cases nonexistent.\n\nAnnual tuition and fees for a private, nonprofit four-year university in the U.S. last year averaged $31,231, according to the nonprofit College Board. In Germany, universities receive so much in government subsidies that most students\u2014including international students\u2014pay no tuition at all.\n\nWhile it may not qualify as an exodus, some of the most popular countries for college enrollments abroad have seen sharp upticks since 2011-12, when more than 46,500 U.S. students were enrolled in foreign academic-degree programs, according to the Institute of International Education. Britain, the No.1 country for U.S. students, saw an 8% annual increase in 2012-13. German universities, meanwhile, experienced a 33% increase between 2010 and 2013, according to the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).\n\n\u201cSuddenly the Old World is becoming a pretty interesting place,\u201d says Allan Goodman, president and chief executive of the Institute of International Education. \u201cMany degree programs have courses taught in English, many of them have very robust scholarships or are tuition-free, and the subjects are very relevant to the world in which we live.\u201d\n\nScotland calling\n\nWhen Fritz Lodge of Basalt, Colo., was looking for undergraduate courses in international relations and Middle Eastern studies a few years ago, he applied to colleges in the U.S. and the U.K. He chose to attend the University of St Andrews in Scotland, where the 2014-15 undergraduate tuition fee for international students was \u00a316,230 (about $25,300) for most subjects.\n\n\u201cIt was on par with or better than the schools I was looking at in the States, and it was about half the price,\u201d says Mr. Lodge. He also liked the fact that he was able to take a \u201cgap year,\u201d deferring his college entry to visit Israel and work on an archaeological dig.\n\nChris Payne, head of the U.S. office of King\u2019s College London, says that he\u2019s seen growing interest from U.S. students, and that cost is a key factor. \u201cThe U.K. is more affordable than comparable U.S. colleges,\u201d he says. Ivy League and top research universities in the U.S. can cost $50,000 or $60,000, he notes. King\u2019s College London cost \u00a315,200 (about $23,740) for the 2014-15 academic year.\n\nCanada, the No. 2 destination for U.S. college students enrolling abroad, had more than 7,000 U.S. students in 2011-12, according to the Institute of International Education. Statistics Canada reports that average tuition for international undergrads in Canada last year was C$20,447 (about US$15,380).\n\n\u201cCanada\u2019s a great bargain in terms of the quality of education for the cost,\u201d says Michele Hern\u00e1ndez, president of college consulting firm Top Tier Admissions. \u201cU.S. schools are crazy expensive and feel like they have to offer every facility, every amenity to attract new students,\u201d says Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez. \u201cThat\u2019s what a lot of your tuition\u2019s going to. At a lot of international schools, they don\u2019t feel like they have to offer kids a spa or a gym.\u201d\n\nThere are other benefits to studying abroad as well. \u201cPeople in other countries approach issues very differently,\u201d says Dr. Goodman, \u201cand it\u2019s really important if you\u2019re going to work and live in an intercultural world to know that.\u201d\n\nSome drawbacks\n\nOf course, there can be downsides, too. If you want to work in the U.S. after graduation, for example, a U.S. school may be better able to smooth the way for you with career advice and contacts; at an international school, such advice may be locally geared.\n\n\u201cSome of the undergraduate U.S. schools have ties to Wall Street, for example, and can help you find your first job,\u201d Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez notes. \u201cOn the other hand, you could easily do your undergraduate degree abroad, and then go to business school in the U.S. and get your first job from there. So it depends on your career path.\u201d\n\nDifferences in language and culture can also be a hindrance. In Germany, a good understanding of German is essential for many courses. But 1,712 courses are taught partly or completely in English and roughly 1,000 are English-only, says Nina Lemmens, director of Germany\u2019s DAAD office in New York.\n\nStudents should expect some differences in the academic system and the teaching style, says Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez. In Britain, for instance, degree programs tend to have a much stronger subject focus: Students declare their majors when applying, do most or all of their classes in that subject, and may face difficulties if they want to switch later.\n\nFor students not sure yet about a career but who still want to study abroad, she suggests applying to a U.S. school and taking advantage of study-abroad programs.\n\nAid availability\n\nSometimes, a simple comparison of the \u201csticker prices\u201d of universities in the U.S. and abroad can be misleading as well. \u201cIn the U.S., there are lots of financial-aid packages that can reduce the price quite considerably,\u201d says Kings College London\u2019s Mr. Payne. \u201cIn the U.K., our tuition is our tuition,\u201d and students are likely to find less financial aid.\n\nU.S. federal student loans, however, are available for Americans to study overseas. Indeed, hundreds of overseas institutions participate in the U.S. student loan program, which is applied for by filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.\n\nMr. Blackman is a writer living in Crete.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/questions-families-need-to-ask-about-paying-for-college-1442800935", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "When parents and children talk about applying for colleges, they often skip over talking about the money. MarketWatch's Jillian Berman discusses. Illustration: Lindsay Holmes for The Wall Street Journal\n\nWhen parents and children talk about applying for colleges, they consider all sorts of factors: the school\u2019s prestige, the location, even the food in the dormitories.\n\nBut often there\u2019s one thing that never is on the agenda: How are we going to pay for this?\n\nThe reasons for avoiding the subject are as varied as families themselves. Some parents\u2014who are conditioned to want the best for their child\u2014feel guilty implying money considerations might limit the choice of school. Others may simply consider the family\u2019s financial situation taboo, even more so than sex.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the sleeping elephant in the room that parents and kids hardly ever broach,\u201d says Andy Lockwood, a college finance and admissions consultant based in Syosset, N.Y.\n\nYet money should be front and center when choosing a school. It not only has a big bearing on what school students can or should attend, it could have a huge impact on the family for decades to come. Children might choose a dream school only to discover the family can\u2019t afford it when the bills come in. Parents who don\u2019t take a hard look at finances might assume mountains of debt they\u2019ll have to pay off well into retirement\u2014or saddle their children with decades of loans.\n\nSo, how can families take a realistic look at money and college? It comes down to communication, and asking themselves questions that force them to talk about money and schooling in a way they normally don\u2019t. Questions such as: How much longer will the parents have to work to cover the costs of a pricey college? And: How much will the child need to earn after graduation to pay off loans in a reasonable time?\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of those questions\u2014and why the answers are crucial.\n\nWhat does the student want to get out of college?\n\nToo often, students focus their search on factors\u2014such as the vibe they get from a campus tour\u2014that are extraneous to their true purpose for attending college, says Kevin Fudge, the manager of government relations and community affairs for American Student Assistance, a nonprofit focused on helping families make informed decisions about college financing and repaying student loans. If students focus on specific academic motivations, they\u2019re more likely to find a school that will help them achieve their goals and will feel like a good investment after graduation.\n\nJayne Pearl, the author of several books on talking to children about money, suggests the problem starts at the very beginning of the conversation about college. Instead of asking students what specific colleges they want to attend or where in the country they\u2019d like to go to school, she suggests asking students what two or three criteria they require from a college. And then families can look for more affordable schools that fit that bill.\n\nMr. Lockwood says it may make sense for students interested in going into a lucrative and competitive field where networks play a large role in hiring\u2014like investment banking\u2014to attend a prestigious and pricey school. But many teenagers have multiple interests, don\u2019t know their career plans or are interested in a field where a decent education is available at most schools. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of kids take a look at really expensive private colleges and I say, \u2018What are you thinking about majoring in?\u2019 and then they say, \u2018Education,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Lockwood says. \u201cYou could pretty much do the same thing by going to a state school.\u201d\n\nIn fact, for students who want to go to a competitive graduate school, it may make more sense for them to attend a cheap and less prestigious undergraduate college, where they can excel, improve their chances of getting into their top graduate school and leave their undergraduate studies with relatively low levels of debt or no debt at all, he says.\n\nHow much are parents willing to contribute?\n\nToo often, parents feel guilty if their finances limit their child\u2019s ability to go to their dream school, which is why they\u2019re willing to \u201cbeg, borrow and steal\u201d or go into massive debt to help the child get there, says Beth Kobliner, a personal-finance author.\n\nParents who are feeling this way should take a step back and consider their values, Ms. Pearl says. Does making sure your child gets a good education really require that they attend an expensive college? Can you get that value if your child attends the local public university?\n\nInstead of focusing on stretching their resources to afford their child\u2019s school of choice, Mr. Fudge suggests parents think critically about why they\u2019re placing so much value on whether they can send their child there. He likes to remind moms and dads that sending their children to college isn\u2019t the \u201ccapstone project\u201d of their parenting career. \u201cWhere your student goes is not a reflection of how well you did as a parent,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact that you can\u2019t afford a particular school is a market condition.\u201d\n\nIf parents instead prioritize keeping their children safe, including in their financial lives, they\u2019ll avoid saddling them with crippling debt or putting their own financial well-being in danger.\n\nParents may also need to take special circumstances into account, such as whether they\u2019ll need to help a younger sibling finance college. The simplest way for parents to help multiple children is to tell each child they\u2019ll do what it takes to help them attend the cheapest school they get into, says Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of Edvisors, a financial-aid information website. Beyond that, though, each child will have to work or find another way to help contribute if they want to attend a more expensive school.\n\nParents should also consider what happens if they lose a job or otherwise face financial straits. Mr. Lockwood suggests parents ask themselves whether sending their child to their dream school is worth stretching their resources so much that they put themselves at risk in a financial emergency. Taking stock of the family\u2019s resources and monthly spending may also help parents realize they could make some small sacrifices to get their child to their school of choice, such as giving up an annual family vacation or waiting a few years for a new car.\n\nHow much longer might parents have to work?\n\nParents have to understand that paying for college could end up forcing them to make a huge sacrifice: Work more years than they planned. Consider that a couple earning $100,000 annually who shells out $120,000 over four years of college will need to spend an 12 extra years working to recoup those funds.\n\nOne way out of the trap is for parents to give up the idea of maintaining their current lifestyle while spending thousands of dollars on tuition, says Stuart Ritter, a senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price.\n\nIt would take three years for a family earning $100,000 per year to recoup a $30,000 contribution\u2014or slightly less than the average cost of tuition and fees for one year at a four-year private school, according to the College Board\u2014assuming they devote 10% of their monthly income, or $833.33, to the task, according to calculations from Mr. Kantrowitz. If parents can find another way to get that $833.33 a month by cutting back on other expenses, then they can avoid working an extra three years past the time they originally planned to retire.\n\nEven if parents are comfortable with the idea of postponing their retirement, they could fall ill, lose their job or face other unforeseen circumstances that would prevent them from continuing to work after they\u2019ve already taken on the debt.\n\nOnce parents have determined how much they are willing to contribute and borrow, they should figure out how their resources stack up to the cost of the colleges their student is considering, says Mr. Kantrowitz. To do this, parents should first add up their college savings, how much they\u2019re willing to contribute from their income each year and how much they\u2019re willing and able to take on in loans. Then they should use a net-price calculator, which colleges and universities are required by law to have on their websites, to estimate the net price of attendance.\n\nNext, they should subtract their resources from the colleges\u2019 net prices and rank the schools according to the gap between them, Mr. Kantrowitz says. This will give them a realistic starting point for having the numbers talk with their child.\n\nShould the student help out by working?\n\nDetermining the financial feasibility of a school also means figuring out what a student can contribute\u2014by working, for instance.\n\nIf students do decide they want to take on a job, they probably won\u2019t struggle to find one. Work-study jobs, offered to eligible students as part of their financial-aid packages, are generally pretty \u201crecession resistant,\u201d says Mr. Kantrowitz. Even the jobs students find on the free market are typically safe from economic downswings because companies surrounding a college tend to exist in a bubble buoyed by the school, he says.\n\nBefore committing to a job, though, students should assess whether they can work and stay on track to graduate on time. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make more money over time if you graduate in four years instead of coming back for a fifth year because you were working,\u201d says Phil Schuman, the director of financial literacy at Indiana University.\n\nToo much work can also hurt a student\u2019s grades. First-year students at four-year colleges who work more than 20 hours per week had an average GPA of 2.95, according to a paper published in the Journal of Population Economics in 2010, compared with 3.13 for those who work one to 20 hours per week and 3.04 for those who don\u2019t work at all.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, students working for pay outside of a work-study arrangement should be careful: Any earnings a student makes above about $6,000 could ding their eligibility for financial aid, Mr. Kantrowitz says.\n\nHow much debt should the student take on?\n\nThough parents\u2019 first inclination may be to shield their children from going into debt by taking on loans themselves, in many cases it makes sense for students to shoulder most of the burden because they have a chance to reap the investment of the degree and they have more time to pay off the debt, says Mr. Fudge.\n\nFinancial-aid counselors say that the total amount of loans a student takes over four years shouldn\u2019t exceed what the student expects to earn in his or her first year out of college. Otherwise, they\u2019ll struggle to pay it back in 10 years, the standard repayment term for a federal loan.\n\nA student who plans to make $35,000 per year and takes out $35,000 in loans will need to devote about 12.3% of her monthly income to pay off the loan in 10 years\u2014assuming a 4.29% interest rate, the rate on federal undergraduate loans for the 2015-2016 academic year\u2014according to calculations by Mr. Kantrowitz. If that same student took out $40,000 in loans, she\u2019d need to devote 14.1% of her income to pay back the loan in 10 years, assuming her income remains at $35,000. If she took out $57,500, the federal limit for undergraduate borrowers who are independent of their parents, she\u2019d need to devote 20.2%.\n\nStudents with federal loans who earn too little to manage their monthly payments can use income-driven repayment programs, which cap payments at a percentage of a borrower\u2019s discretionary income. But that will extend the lifetime of the loan, meaning borrowers could spend decades paying down the debt.\n\nFor example, if a student makes $35,000 out of school and devotes 10% of her monthly income to paying back the debt, she\u2019ll spend 13 years and one month making payments, assuming the 4.29% interest rate and that she borrows $35,000, according to Mr. Kantrowitz\u2019s calculations. If that same student chose a more-expensive school and needed to borrow $40,000, she\u2019d spend 15.7 years paying it off. If she chose an even more-expensive school, took out $57,500 and devoted 10% of her income to paying off the loans, it would take 28.5 years to pay them back. Borrowers of federal loans who enroll in certain income-driven repayment programs can have loans forgiven after 20 or 25 years of repayment, but they must pay taxes on the forgiven debt. Borrowers who commit to work in a public-service occupation full time could have debt forgiven after 10 years tax-free.\n\nBut even these numbers can seem abstract to teenagers who have never had to deal with a nonnegotiable bill. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to describe to a 12-year-old what it\u2019s like to be in love,\u201d says Susan Engel, a senior lecturer in psychology at Williams College.\n\nSo they need to have a sense of how a monthly loan payment could affect their day-to-day life. Parents need to ask students what sacrifices they\u2019re willing to make later on to cover their loan payments. This could mean taking on a less-desirable but higher-paying job, forgoing vacations or moving back home with Mom and Dad after graduation.\n\nMr. Ritter advises clients to take their children to see two apartments whose monthly rent differs by the same amount as their loan payments at different schools. That way, students can see the amenities they could afford post-college if they opt for the less-expensive school.\n\nWill the student be able to pay back the debt?\n\nToo often, students divorce career and salary goals from their choice of school, when it should be a crucial consideration. For instance, the difference in lifetime earnings between a bachelor\u2019s degree in petroleum engineering and one in early childhood education\u2014the highest- and lowest-paying majors, respectively\u2014is $3.4 million, according to a report from the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. That\u2019s larger than the difference in lifetime earnings between Americans with a college degree and those with just a high-school diploma.\n\nAnthony Carnevale, director of the Georgetown center and co-author of the report, says he often finds himself talking with students about their majors and \u201cwhen they say classics and rhetoric and stuff like that, there\u2019s a little bell that goes off in my head that says, \u2018Unemployed.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean a student should necessarily avoid pursuing a less-lucrative major, Ms. Kobliner says, but parents should talk with students to help prepare them for post-college reality. She does caution parents against dictating to their students \u201cbecause it\u2019s likely not to work.\u201d Instead, she says parents should ask them questions that crystallize their priorities: Does the pricey school where they want to pursue their less lucrative degree offer something extraordinary that they can\u2019t get anywhere else, such as access to a community of artists for pursuing a bachelor\u2019s in fine arts?\n\nWhat does financial aid look like for all four years?\n\nFamilies often focus on how they\u2019re going to finance the first year of school instead of calculating the total cost of the degree, says Kal Chany, president New York-based Campus Consultants Inc. But if a student is forced to transfer after the first year because of expenses, then the efforts to finance that first year will be a wash. That\u2019s because the family shells out for one year at an expensive college, but the student won\u2019t reap the benefit of graduating from it. It\u2019s also not uncommon for schools to front-load grants, so students receive more gift aid their freshman year than in the following years, Mr. Kantrowitz says.\n\nFinancial-aid offers can also change from year to year. Jodi Okun, founder of College Financial Aid Advisers and Discover Student Loans brand ambassador, says she recently got a call from a parent whose son lost the aid he\u2019d received during his first two years of school. The school considered the family\u2019s situation a special financial circumstance for the first two years because the parents had recently lost their jobs. Then the financial-aid office informed the family that they couldn\u2019t fulfill the special-circumstance request for a third year. The son had to take on a loan to cover the difference.\n\nMr. Chany also suggests families look carefully at the academic requirements for any merit-based scholarships the student receives to make sure the student can reasonably maintain eligibility.\n\nShould students consider a community college?\n\nStudents who have the credentials to get into a four-year school are often wary of considering community college, says Mr. Lockwood, but starting off at a two-year school and transferring to a more selective college could be a great way to save money. Last academic year, the average cost of tuition and fees for one year at a two-year public college was $5,792 less than that of an in-state resident at a public four-year college, according to the College Board.\n\nParents should try to \u201cshift the goalposts\u201d for their children, Mr. Fudge says. Many students view attending their dream school as the reward for working hard in high school. Instead, parents should portray financial independence in their mid-20s\u2014a goal that\u2019s more easily achieved by saving money in college\u2014as the sweetest reward.\n\nHe also advises parents to tell students that choosing an expensive school may not leave any money for other options, such as attending graduate school or studying abroad. \u201cYou\u2019re giving yourself flexibility and choice along the way,\u201d he says.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nBorrowers of federal loans who enroll in certain income-driven repayment programs can have loans forgiven after 20 or 25 years of repayment, but they must pay taxes on the forgiven debt. Borrowers who commit to work in a public service occupation full-time could have debt forgiven after 10 years tax-free.

Moreover, the government released the data in a format that is easy for sites to incorporate into their rankings of schools.\n\nUpdated Scorecard\n\nAt the same time, the Department of Education unveiled a revamped version of its College Scorecard, a website that helps people sort through data by individual school, degree program, location, size and other factors. Users can see the average annual cost of a college for families of different incomes, the school\u2019s graduation rate, median earnings after 10 years, share of students paying down their debt and other financial information. The data is aggregated from a variety of government sources.\n\nThe Obama administration has framed the data release and new College Scorecard as an antidote to traditional college rankings, such as those in U.S. News & World Report, which emphasize a college\u2019s selectivity and the amount it spends per student.\n\n\u201cThese are the exact wrong incentives to give our colleges and the wrong message to send our students,\u201d said James Kvaal, deputy director of White House domestic policy, in a conference call announcing the data release. \u201cThose kinds of fine distinctions and arbitrary rankings I think are not useful for students trying to choose among colleges,\u201d he later added.\n\nA spokesman for U.S. News & World Report says selectivity accounts for 12.5% of a college\u2019s score in the company\u2019s Best Colleges ranking. Robert Morse, chief data strategist for U.S. News, says factors such as graduation and retention rates are weighted more heavily. The rankings do consider how much a school spends on its students, but only in core areas such as instruction, student services and academic support, he says.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. News rankings specifically measure academic excellence, and the factors included in our methodology reflect that,\u201d says Mr. Morse, who adds that prospective students \u201cshould not base their college choice on earnings alone.\u201d He also notes, however, that there appears to be a correlation between earning a good salary, as indicated in the Scorecard data, and schools ranked highly by U.S. News.\n\nHelp for some\n\nThe government data has been a boon to College Abacus, for one, a site that compares more than 5,000 colleges based on likely net price\u2014after financial assistance, work study and other aid resources are factored in. The new data have given the site the ability to show debt-repayment rates and average earnings for people who enrolled at a given school alongside students\u2019 individual net prices.\n\nThe data also led College Abacus\u2019s parent company, education nonprofit ECMC Group, to launch Pell Abacus, a site that helps low-income students understand their financial-aid options.\n\nAbigail Seldin, co-founder of College Abacus and vice president of innovation and product management at ECMC Group, says the government\u2019s decision to unlock the data makes her site more useful, and serves as an endorsement of choosing schools based on financial factors instead of focusing solely on more traditional factors like social and academic fit.\n\nWithout good information, many students, in particular low-income students, end up applying to the most selective colleges and the schools closest to where they live because they aren\u2019t familiar with other options, says Diana Adamson, executive director of the nonprofit ScholarMatch, which created ScholarMatcher, a college-search tool geared toward families earning less than $50,000. This site, which also incorporates the federal data, has just 296 schools in its database. But that\u2019s because it focuses on schools where students have the best chance of graduating with a manageable debt burden.\n\nIontuition, a platform for borrowers to manage student-loan payments and learn money-management tips, launched a college-search tool with a return-on-investment focus earlier this year, called ionMatch. Families can compare schools by the estimated cost of a degree, potential salaries after graduation and other factors. It hopes to soon add a filter that will rank schools with scores based on their returns on investment.\n\nOf course, not everyone looks at how to decide on a college the same way. To some, financial data, while important, should not govern the process.\n\nWhen PayScale, a site that provides real-time salary data, launched a college-return-on-investment survey in 2010, there was a lot of pushback, particularly from colleges. \u201cPeople were really resistant to this idea of assigning any kind of financial return to higher education,\u201d says Lydia Frank, senior director of editorial and marketing. In recent years, however, PayScale has seen the conversation shift. The idea of weighing finances in the college-selection process is no longer considered radical, Ms. Frank says. PayScale was among the organizations to get access to the government\u2019s student financial data before its public release.\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe intangibles\n\nSome critics, however, continue to say that college-search tools that focus too intently on financial data miss the point of college. Zeroing in on factors like the average salary of graduates or students\u2019 ability to repay loans \u201ccheapens and frankly distorts\u201d the true purpose of college, says Jerry Z. Muller, a history professor at Catholic University of America.\n\nThe true return on investment in a college often can\u2019t be measured in monetary terms, he says. According to Mr. Muller, the success of a college experience can be better understood through whether a person learns to think critically, becomes more interesting and interested in the world and turns into a better job candidate, friend or life partner.\n\nIf financials become too large of a consideration in the college-search process, Mr. Muller says, schools may become hesitant to admit students they don\u2019t think will be financially successful.\n\nColleges may also shift their priorities away from providing students with a well-rounded education and instead focus on only high-earning fields.\n\nIn that case, says Mr. Muller, \u201cthey might as well shut down the classics department.\u201d\n\nMs. Berman is a reporter for MarketWatch in New York.

Then it caught on as a way to help launch small businesses. It is now being used for a wide variety of more personal needs, including paying for college.\n\nStudents short on tuition use crowdfunding sites to post information about their situation and blast out an appeal through social media, sometimes using tools on the site. Typically there are fees charged to the person raising the money. But each site tries to make it easy for the user to reach a lot of people at once and to manage the payments.\n\nIndeed, with college tuition costs rising so quickly, crowdfunding has an important role to play, says Craig Lemoine, associate professor of financial planning at the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pa. \u201cIt may not have taken a village to send someone to college in 1970, but in 2015 it does,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving a convenient way of asking friends and family to help is very important.\u201d\n\nOn one popular site, GoFundMe, the education category has grown to more than 160,000 campaigns so far this year, from 135 in 2010; donations for 2015 through September have soared to $27.3 million, up from $16,493 for 2010.\n\nThe crowdfunding site Indiegogo has seen such an uptick in tuition funding, says chief executive Slava Rubin, it launched a new service last December, Indiegogo Life (recently renamed Generosity), designed for education and other \u201cpersonal\u201d causes.\n\nMs. Riquelme, now in her fourth year at University of Alaska, didn\u2019t have high hopes for her own campaign. \u201cI didn\u2019t think my situation was severe enough,\u201d she says. \u201cI went into this not really expecting anything. I thought it would just be a few donations from a couple of my friends and their parents.\u201d\n\nBut with only a couple of days left to pay her tuition, she decided to create a profile on GoFundMe. She posted a photo, briefly described her situation, suggested donation amounts, from $5 to $20, then sent the link to some friends through email and Facebook.\n\nTo her surprise, the first donation was for $50. After that, things began to snowball, as former high-school teachers and parents of her friends not only donated but encouraged their friends to donate.\n\n\u201cOnce I put it out there, it kind of took a life of its own,\u201d says Ms. Riquelme. Even people who couldn\u2019t donate sent messages of support. \u201cIt was really incredible to see the feedback,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that.\u201d She met her $1,700 goal in just two days.\n\nLimits and fees\n\nFor students looking to raise some tuition money on crowdfunding sites, experts advise that they realize the limits. Yes, crowdfunding can be useful to fill gaps in funding, but no one should rely on it as their primary way of paying for college. \u201cThe average campaign raises about $1,000,\u201d says Salvador Briggman, founder of Crowdcrux, a crowdfunding information site.\n\nThere also are fees. GoFundMe charges 5% of each donation, on top of which an independent payment processor, WePay, charges a fee of 2.9% plus 30 cents per transaction. So, for a $100 donation, total fees would be $8.20: $5 for GoFundMe, and $3.20 for WePay. Ms. Riquelme says that for the $1,730 she raised through GoFundMe, she paid $146.24 in fees. Users of Generosity pay only its payment processor: a 3% fee plus 30 cents per transaction.\n\nCommunication is key\n\nExperts also say that getting the word out is critical, and many people are doing it wrong. \u201cBegging is a huge turnoff,\u201d says Mr. Briggman. \u201cWhat I typically see people do with personal crowdfunding is just blast it on Facebook as an update, saying, \u2018Please give me money, please share, please donate.\u2019 That\u2019s the worst way to do it.\u201d\n\nBefore students even start the campaign, Mr. Briggman suggests they send individual emails or make phone calls to their closest friends and family, explaining what they\u2019re doing and why. That way, when the campaign launches and they contact them again, they\u2019re likely to get a solid base of early donations from their core supporters, he says.\n\nHe and others also suggest students post thank-you notes on social media to each of their supporters. When other people see those messages they\u2019ll be reminded to check out the student\u2019s campaign. Showing that other people are donating is much more effective than just asking for money, Mr. Briggman says.\n\nWhy not just ask friends and family directly? People tend to find it \u201cless socially awkward\u201d to send people a link to a crowdfunding profile than to ask for a check, says Prof. Lemoine.\n\nOpen door?\n\nMeanwhile, even when students don\u2019t reach their goal, most sites allow them to keep whatever they raise and to leave the campaign running indefinitely. That means, at least in theory, they could use the same campaign to help with multiple years of tuition.\n\nMs. Riquelme, for one, says she\u2019s unlikely to use crowdfunding again, citing donor fatigue. \u201cPeople will be like, \u2018Is she just relying on the community to pay for her school now?\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Blackman is a writer living in Crete.

Photo: George Frey/Bloomberg News\n\nGoing off to college comes with newfound financial freedoms. And for many college students that means their first foray into the world of credit and debt.\n\nThere is no shortage of credit-card offers on and off campus, from cards with cash-back rewards to those geared specifically toward students. According to an Experian College Graduate Survey conducted in April, 58% of soon-to-be-graduates surveyed said they had a credit card, while 30% said they had credit-card debt, with an average balance of $2,573.\n\nMany people argue that having a credit card allows students to learn to manage a debt load and the responsibility of paying bills on time. And, for some parents, credit cards provide a convenient way for their children to buy things while they are away at school without having to reach out every time they need funds for a purchase.\n\nBut others say giving a credit card to a college student with little personal-finance know-how is a recipe for a debt disaster. That\u2019s especially true since many graduates already are leaving college over-burdened by student loans, the critics say.\n\nYES: It\u2019s the best time for people to learn how to manage finances\n\nBy Beverly Harzog\n\nCredit cards have a dark side if used irresponsibly. But responsible use during college\u2014with supervision and training from parents\u2014can help give young adults a financial head start on postgraduation life.\n\nFor one thing, letting your child have a card means you have the chance to teach them the skills they need to use it. Once your child graduates, you\u2019ll lose influence over their decisions. It\u2019s the natural order of things. That\u2019s why you need to seize the opportunity to offer financial guidance and help secure a good financial future. When your child becomes a confident and responsible user of credit, paying the credit-card bill on time and staying out of debt become a lifelong habit.\n\nAn early start\n\nThere are other benefits to starting down the credit path early on. Learning how to handle credit mistakes during college is much safer\u2014and usually cheaper\u2014than after graduation, when graduates may be facing student debt and may be tempted to sign up for cards with higher credit limits. It\u2019s important they get a lesson in compound interest and controlling their spending before that happens.\n\nGetting a card in college is also an opportunity to teach children how the FICO score is connected to their credit habits. Great habits lead to a great score. If they make a mistake, they\u2019ll learn the consequences of that, too. And, since boosting your FICO score takes time, it\u2019s crucial to get an early start.\n\nThat leads to a broader point: The transition to adulthood is smoother and less costly when the graduate already has a good credit history in place. Good credit leads to lower deposits for an apartment and for turning on utilities. It also results in lower premiums for health insurance and car insurance. And it helps graduates land that first job, as more employers are looking at credit history.\n\nAnother reason for a credit card? College students often need to buy textbooks and other school-related items online. Credit cards come with better consumer protections and, in many cases, zero liability in case of fraud.\n\nLikewise, you might not be there every time your child calls or texts you from college. There might be unexpected expenses, such as car repairs or a medical crisis. Having a credit card ensures that your child is covered financially and can get help when needed.\n\nInvolvement is crucial\n\nI completely agree with critics about the risks of credit-card use. I made plenty of mistakes myself as a young adult\u2014because I didn\u2019t have training in how to use credit. I also agree that colleges pushing cards on students is a problem and must be controlled.\n\nEverything I say is based on parental involvement. Once your children have cards, the real work begins. You can\u2019t take a hands-off approach. Stress that credit is dangerous if used irresponsibly. But also teach them that good credit is a financial tool that will help them save money throughout their lives. Empowerment is the answer, not avoidance.\n\nMs. Harzog is a consumer-credit expert and author, most recently, of \u201cThe Debt Escape Plan: How to Free Yourself From Credit Card Balances, Boost Your Credit Score, and Live Debt-Free.\u201d She can be reached at reports@wsj.com.\n\nNO: Too many end college with high debt and poor credit scores\n\nBy Robert D. Manning\n\nAs a researcher on credit cards for over 20 years, I have seen the enormous toll that consumer debt creates for college students.\n\nThey often make impulsive purchases without understanding long-term consequences: alcohol, expensive gifts, lavish vacations, casino gambling, costly electronics and much more.\n\nA lingering problem\n\nThen, after graduation, they learn the reality of their indulgence. They must make major sacrifices to pay credit-card debt and student loans each month. They are saddled with low credit scores that may deny them the ability to rent an apartment, obtain loans for graduate school or qualify for a mortgage. They may even lose a job if an employer has concerns with their debt load and payment history.\n\nParents, too, may face consequences. Credit-card companies have shifted from requiring parental co-signatures to granting accounts directly to students under 21\u2014and then suing parents for the unpaid balances.\n\nSome will say that denying students credit cards goes too far. Parents, the argument goes, can supervise their children\u2019s card use and teach them financial responsibility that will help them build a good credit track record and serve them through the rest of their lives.\n\nYet when children begin college, parents have effectively ceded control over their daily financial decisions. College students are more heavily influenced by peers and mass-marketing campaigns, my research has found.\n\nI have also found that students have learned tricks to keep parents in the dark on their spending. For one, they use credit cards co-signed by parents for approved purchases, then get other credit cards for purchases they don\u2019t want their parents to know about.\n\nThere\u2019s also the bad influence of colleges themselves to consider. Before the financial crisis of 2007-08, credit cards were provided to students like candy. Schools routinely signed multimillion-dollar exclusive marketing agreements\u2014and were incentivized to promote card use without disclosing terms and costs. The dearth of financial-education classes and workshops on campus created a perfect storm for competitive consumption.\n\nFederal regulations and advances in payment systems (including debit and prepaid cards) have improved students\u2019 use of credit. But colleges still push cards, and misuse of them remains a serious problem\u2014especially in the absence of effective financial education.\n\nKeep it simple\n\nBeyond that, there are many opportunities for a student to build a good financial track record without a credit card. For one, students could simply pay for their expenses with cash. Students are much more likely to pick up good habits by exhausting their checking and savings accounts and then learning how to budget on their limited financial resources. Ultimately, it is about learning practical skills that help students make prudent decisions. After all, isn\u2019t that what college is all about?\n\nDr. Manning, the author of \u201cCredit Card Nation\u201d and \u201cLiving With Debt,\u201d is senior research fellow at the Institute for Higher Education Law and Governance at the University of Houston Law School.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/do-elite-colleges-lead-to-higher-salaries-only-for-some-professions-1454295674", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Illustration: Stuart Bradford\n\nFor all the thought that families put into choosing a college, very often the decision is dominated by a simple line of reasoning: The more prestigious the school you attend, the higher your salary will be after you graduate.\n\nSo, they focus their efforts on getting their children into the best possible college they can afford, figuring that even if they\u2019re paying more tuition now, they\u2019re maximizing earnings down the road.\n\nBut that formula doesn\u2019t always hold true. And following it blindly can leave graduates burdened with much more debt than necessary when they get out of school.\n\nWe reached that conclusion after analyzing a survey of thousands of college graduates and looking at what they were making a decade after they got out of school. What we found: Diplomas from prestigious schools boost future earnings only in certain fields, while in other fields they simply don\u2019t make a difference.\n\nSpecifically, for business and other liberal-arts majors, the prestige of the school has a major impact on future earnings expectations. But for fields like science, technology, engineering and math, it largely doesn\u2019t matter whether students go to a prestigious, expensive school or a low-priced one\u2014expected earnings turn out the same. So, families may be wasting money by chasing an expensive diploma in those fields.\n\nHow much of a role does the prestige of a college or university play in a student's career success? Brigham Young University professor of economics Eric Eide, lead author of a broad study of college graduates, explains that is has a lot to do with a student's major. Photo: Getty\n\nThe question of prestige and future pay is complicated in other ways, too. Students may not actually be able to get into their desired major at a prestigious school, for one thing, further undermining the value of their choice. And some who do land their major of choice may face other concerns: It may take them longer to graduate than another major would\u2014or they may not graduate at all, which would limit or erase the hoped-for salary advantage.\n\nWhen prestige matters\n\nIn our study, we looked at about 7,300 college graduates 10 years after graduation. We divided their majors into several categories: business, engineering, science, social science, humanities, education and other. And we used three broad classifications for college type: selective, which covers elite schools and other highly competitive institutions; midtier; and less selective, which covers schools with open enrollment.\n\nWhat we found startled us. For STEM-related majors, average earnings don\u2019t vary much among the college categories. For example, we find no statistically significant differences in average earnings for science majors between selective schools and either midtier or less-selective schools. Likewise, there\u2019s no significant earnings difference between engineering graduates from selective and less-selective colleges, and only a marginally significant difference between selective and midtier colleges.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on? For potential employers, the skills students learn in these fields appear to trump prestige\u2014possibly because curriculums are relatively standardized and there\u2019s a commonly accepted body of knowledge students must absorb. So, a student may not need to attend the best possible school to ensure a good salary after graduation. (It\u2019s important to note that we controlled for numerous other factors that might influence postgraduation earnings, such as family income, race/ethnicity, gender, marital status, SAT score, postgraduate degree and age at graduation and more.)\n\nOur findings are crucial for families to understand because chasing a prestigious STEM degree can leave students burdened with huge amounts of unnecessary debt. Financial aid can certainly help, but for many families, the cost of education can still differ dramatically across schools. For example, if an engineering student chose to attend the University of Pennsylvania instead of Texas A&M, the average starting salary would differ by less than $1,000, but the tuition difference would be over $167,000. At that slightly higher salary, you\u2019d have to work for more than 150 years before you make up for that vast tuition difference.\n\nThat said, the earnings picture is very different for other fields. Outside of STEM, it matters tremendously where a student receives a degree.\n\nThe starkest earnings differences are for business majors, where graduates from the selective institutions earn 12% more on average than midtier graduates and 18% more than graduates from less-selective colleges. Likewise, social-science majors from selective colleges earn 11% more than their midtier counterparts and 14% more than those from less-selective schools.\n\nFor education majors, the differences are 6% and 9%, respectively. In humanities, graduates of selective schools earn 11% more than those from less-selective ones, although they don\u2019t earn more than those from midtier schools.\n\nThere are many possible explanations for the disparities. In business, more prestigious schools may offer better alumni networks and other connections with potential employers. In other fields of study, more prestigious schools may offer better peer connections, faculty, university resources and, at least in social science and the humanities, access to better graduate programs. Whatever the reason, parents and students may be justified in looking for a prestigious degree in these majors.\n\nDigging into numbers\n\nThe obvious, practical takeaway from all this is that families should really dig into the numbers. Because college is potentially one of the biggest investments a family will make, students and their parents should search out the information necessary to calculate the costs and expected future earnings associated with colleges and majors.\n\nColleges offer financial-aid calculators that let families figure out tuition costs, and sites like PayScale.com and College Scorecard offer information about median earnings by college or by major after graduation; PayScale, for one, also offers that information for specific majors at specific schools.\n\nAdditionally, many academic departments keep track of their graduates\u2019 job placements, so families can find out, for instance, how many liberal-arts graduates from the University of Colorado ended up in management-trainee positions or teaching posts compared with graduates from Harvard University.\n\nBut the data can often be more nuanced than they appear. For one thing, there\u2019s the obvious point that all these numbers are averages: Any individual\u2019s actual salary may fall above or below those figures.\n\nIn addition, there\u2019s the question of opportunity costs. When choosing a major, families must consider how long it will take to complete it\u2014because it might involve staying in school longer, driving up the cost of tuition and lowering potential earnings.\n\nConsider a student who is deciding whether to major in engineering or economics, and suppose that it takes one year longer to complete an engineering degree. The starting salary for economics majors in 2015 is $52,100, according to PayScale.com, So if it takes an extra year to complete a degree in engineering relative to economics, then there is an opportunity cost of $52,100 associated with engineering because the student entered the labor force a year later.\n\nIn practical terms, if engineering graduates make about $10,000 per year more than economics grads, then it would be about five years before engineering students would make up the lost salary. It could be up to 10 years if you add in the direct costs of tuition and living expenses for that extra year if the student is at a selective university.\n\nBeyond dollars and cents\n\nFamilies should also remember that even if students get into a chosen school, there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll be able to pursue the major they want. At some universities, high-demand majors have limited enrollment, which means facing another selection process even after being admitted to the school. Grades in prerequisite courses are usually a big part of the admission process, so students should look at their record and consider the odds of being admitted to the program.\n\nAdditionally, many students pursue an undergraduate degree because of the option it gives them to pursue their desired graduate-school program. Someone may choose to study liberal arts because they believe it\u2019s good preparation for law school, and they aren\u2019t concerned with the potential earnings with an undergraduate degree in that field. In such a case, the student should seek information about graduate-school placements from their desired major at the schools they are considering.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to bear in mind that the monetary costs and benefits are just one part of the burden that students will be carrying. There can also be psychic costs to consider. Most people find studying and being evaluated to be stressful. The more competitive the institution, the more academically able are the peers, and so many students who were at the top of their class in high school will find they are average or lower at a highly competitive institution or in a particularly challenging major. This can be a difficult adjustment.\n\nOn the other hand, the emotional benefits of a school\u2014such as living alone for the first time, experiencing campus life and being around new peers\u2014may be more important to some students than a cold calculation of financial rewards.\n\nUltimately, the decision on a college comes down to the student\u2019s aptitudes, interests and preferences. But families should be sure that choice is informed by realistic information about how college will affect a student\u2019s future.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nAn earlier version of the What You\u2019ll Earn chart didn\u2019t specify that salaries listed where median amounts.

Send them to reports@wsj.com.\n\nThe Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or Fafsa, generally ignores grandparent-owned 529 plans until money starts flowing to a college. Distributions are treated as income to the student and cut an aid award by half the amount of the distribution, says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Edvisors.com, a consumer-information website in Las Vegas.\n\nA parent- or student-owned 529 plan, in contrast, must be reported as an asset on Fafsa. That reduces the aid award by 5.64% of plan assets\u2014usually a much smaller hit. And Fafsa doesn\u2019t count distributions from those plans as income.\n\nIf you\u2019re a grandparent who owns a 529 plan, one way to avoid trouble is to wait to distribute the money until after the student\u2019s final Fafsa is filed. \u201cThen there\u2019s no subsequent-year Fafsa to be affected by that distribution,\u201d Mr. Kantrowitz says.\n\nNote: It doesn\u2019t matter who owns a 529 if the student applies to a school that requires the CSS/Financial Aid Profile. In that case, any plans of which the student is a beneficiary must be reported as an asset; distributions are ignored.\n\nAnother strategy: Transfer ownership to the parent. \u201cThe parent will have to report the value of the account as an asset. It\u2019s not a huge [financial-aid] impact, and it\u2019s a lot better than a grandparent using the account to pay for college,\u201d says Joseph Hurley, founder of the website SavingforCollege.com.\n\nBut, Mr. Kantrowitz warns, check state and plan rules; some states prohibit transfers or impose restrictions, such as recapture of tax deductions.\n\nAre there gift-tax consequences in transferring 529-plan ownership to my son [parent of the student]?\n\nThe question assumes an account balance above the annual $14,000 gift-tax exclusion. \u201cIt\u2019s the beneficiary that matters,\u201d Mr. Kantrowitz says. \u201cGenerally speaking, there will be no gift-tax implications here. You\u2019re not changing the beneficiary. It\u2019s already a completed gift, effectively.\u201d But ask a tax adviser before changing beneficiaries or transferring ownership.\n\nBefore he died, my father contributed to a 529 on behalf of my daughter [his granddaughter]. Need anything be done now to ensure that my daughter is able to use these funds for tuition?\n\nGenerally, 529s require account owners to name a successor owner, says John McManus, founder of law firm McManus & Associates in New Providence, N.J. If no successor is named? Some companies automatically name the beneficiary as the successor owner, says Mr. Hurley. If the beneficiary is a minor, parents likely would be named custodial owners.\n\nDoes the account owner or beneficiary pay the taxes and penalty on an \u201coverfunded\u201d plan?\n\nBy \u201coverfunded,\u201d we\u2019re assuming this reader means: Who pays taxes on 529 payouts that don\u2019t go toward qualified education expenses, i.e., nonqualified distributions?\n\nIt sounds like a simple question, but even experts disagree. Some say it depends on who gets the distribution; for example, if the account owner gets the check, the nonqualified distribution is taxed at the owner\u2019s rate.\n\nNot so fast. Mr. Kantrowitz says the statutory language is clear: The nonqualified distribution is taxed at the beneficiary\u2019s tax rate (note that only the earnings are taxed, because the contributions are made after-tax).\n\nA nonqualified distribution isn\u2019t the only option when there is money left over after a student finishes college. \u201cOne way to avoid the overfunding situation is to just leave it sitting there,\u201d says Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst with Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting U.S., in Riverwoods, Ill., perhaps to pay graduate-school bills or to go to a new beneficiary. Visit irs.gov/publications/p970/ and scroll to Chapter 8 to find out more.\n\nCan a 529 be set up for my daughter\u2019s graduate education?\n\nYes, graduate school is a qualified expense. There are some restrictions on \u201cqualified educational expenses\u201d for students enrolled less than half-time.\n\nWhat happens if I withdraw 529 funds for medical bills because my student is unable to attend school?\n\nMedical expenses aren\u2019t a qualified cost, so a distribution would be subject to taxes and the 10% penalty. The exception to the 10% penalty: if the illness rises to the level of a disability, says Mr. Luscombe. But earnings on the distribution still get taxed.\n\nMs. Coombes is a writer in San Francisco.

Gains are nice if investors have been in the fund long enough to have benefited, but they can be painful at tax time: Rates on long-term capital gains can be as high as 23.8%.\n\nA fund has to have performed well to have embedded gains, but then when performance goes south, investors often sell, explains Mark Wilson, chief investment officer of Tarbox Group, a wealth-management firm in Newport Beach, Calif. That leaves a smaller group of shareholders to share the burden of the fund\u2019s capital-gains payout, says Mr. Wilson, who tracks mutual-funds\u2019 capital-gains distributions on his website, CapGainsValet.com.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to be aware of fund flows,\u201d he says. \u201cIf a fund is losing assets, an actively managed fund has little control over what\u2019s going to happen with distributions.\u201d\n\nThe doghouse\n\nMost of the funds on Mr. Wilson\u2019s \u201cIn The Doghouse!\u201d list\u2014those that expect to make capital-gains distributions of more than 20% of their net asset values\u2014invest in the U.S., where markets have had a strong run in prior years, but turned lackluster and volatile this year, he says. While some funds that invest in large-cap companies made his list, there are more small-cap and midcap funds, he says.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not failing horribly, but they are just losing assets,\u201d he says.\n\nAmong those planning large payouts are the $416.5 million Alger SMid Cap Growth Fund (ALMAX), which plans a Dec. 16 distribution of $5.48 a share, or about 32.2% of its Nov. 30 net asset value, and the $367.8 million Alger Small Cap Growth Institutional Fund (ASIRX), which plans to distribute $7.16 a share, or about 33.6% of its Nov. 30 net asset value, on the same date.\n\nFred Alger & Co. had no comment.\n\nMuch-larger funds are also on the list. The $2.1 billion Aston/Montag & Caldwell Growth Fund (MCGFX) plans to distribute about $7.61 a share in long-term capital gains, or 28.6% of its net asset value as of Nov. 30, on Dec. 30.\n\nThe fund held up well in 2008 and did well in 2011, but its recent performance has been mediocre, says David Kathman, a senior analyst at Morningstar Inc. It had net outflows of $2 billion in the 12 months through the end of October, which likely forced it to sell stocks, he says. The fund has shrunk from more than $5 billion in assets in 2013.\n\nThe Aston/Montag fund has gained 5.3% this year through Dec. 2, while its average large-cap growth peer has risen nearly 5.7%. Montag & Caldwell declined to comment on the distribution.\n\nAnother large-cap growth fund\u2014the $260.7 million Wells Fargo Advantage Endeavor Select Fund (STAEX)\u2014expects to make a distribution of $4.26 to $4.56 a share, or around 31.4% to 33.6% of net asset value as of Nov. 30, on Dec. 14, according to the fund firm\u2019s website. Wells Fargo declined to comment.\n\nTwo names that Mr. Wilson was surprised to see on his doghouse list are the $670.3 million Pimco Long-Term U.S. Government Fund (PFGAX) and the tiny $70.8 million Deutsche EAFE Equity Index Fund (BTAEX). The former estimates that it will make a distribution of 38.5% on Dec. 16, while the latter expects to make a 28.9% payout on Dec. 24. Both figures are based on net asset values as of Nov. 30.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unusual to see a bond fund on the list, especially a long-term bond fund,\u201d Mr. Wilson says.\n\nThe Pimco fund rose more than 24% in 2014, which built up its unrealized gains, says Eric Jacobson, a senior analyst at Morningstar. Then it experienced some large redemptions in the first months of this year, he says. By the end of October, its assets had diminished by nearly 70% from the end of 2014, which forced it to sell some assets. A large portion of the redemptions were the result of a tactical shift at Pimco funds run by Rob Arnott, the chairman of Research Affiliates and a subadviser to Pimco, which invests in the Pimco fund, Mr. Jacobson says.\n\nPimco and Mr. Arnott had no comment.\n\nRare appearance\n\nIt\u2019s also unusual to see index funds, which don\u2019t normally do a lot of trading, crop up in the doghouse, Mr. Wilson says. They often pay dividends of just 4% or 5%, he says.\n\nBut the Deutsche fund, which is subadvised by Northern Trust Investment Inc., had a lot of embedded gains and had to sell assets to meet redemptions this year. Northern Trust had no comment.\n\nThe $152.9 million Nuveen NWQ Large-Cap Value Fund (NQCAX) plans to make a distribution of about $3.95, or around 32.6% of its net asset value as of Nov. 30, on Dec. 16.\n\nChip Bailey, head of client portfolio management at NWA Investment Management Co., an affiliate of Nuveen Investments, says mutual-fund cash flows, which are a catalyst for realizing gains, can\u2019t be predicted. \u201cHowever, NWQ does take a very active approach to managing those gains,\u201d he says. \u201cSpecifically, losses might be \u2018harvested,\u2019 and other tools employed to deliver the best possible shareholder experience.\u201d\n\nThere may still be time for some investors to avoid getting hit with a capital-gains distribution. The record dates\u2014the date at which all shareholders in the fund are eligible to receive the distributions\u2014on many of these funds haven\u2019t yet arrived. Shareholders who sell before the record date won\u2019t receive the distribution, but investors should remember that fund trades will take three days to settle.\n\nInvestors who can\u2019t find information about their fund\u2019s record or distribution dates should contact their fund companies.\n\nMr. Wilson advises investors, \u201cBuy index funds in taxable accounts and actively managed funds in 401(k) and individual retirement accounts so you don\u2019t have to worry about fund flows; just worry about total returns.\u201d\n\nRates on long-term capital gains can be as high as 23.8%.

At least one huge payout has already been made: The $206.7 million FPA U.S. Value Fund (FPPFX), formerly FPA Perennial Fund, hit shareholders with a more than 80% distribution in October.\n\nMs. Maxey is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Now, \u2018529\u2019 plans allow one more. Getty Images\n\nYou can now tweak your \u201c529\u201d college-savings plan\u2019s investment options more often. But should you? And should you want to do it even more often?\n\nPresident Barack Obama late last year signed into law a bill allowing investors in the popular, state-sponsored 529 college-savings plans to make changes to their investment holdings twice a year, rather than the once-yearly change permitted under previous Internal Revenue Service restrictions.\n\nBefore the change, investors seeking to adjust their investments within a 529 plan more than once a year had to get around the restriction by simultaneously changing the beneficiary, which could be done as often in a given year as desired.\n\nShort of that, however, investors were handcuffed no matter what the stock market was doing, and that left some 529-plan contributors frustrated. Groups providing information to investors\u2014such as the College Savings Plans Network, an affiliate of the National Association of State Treasurers\u2014had campaigned for four permissible investment changes a year.\n\nEven now, some are clamoring for additional opportunities to adjust their holdings beyond the new twice-a-year window.\n\n\u201cIncreased investment direction helps parents respond more effectively to market volatility,\u201d the College Savings Plans Network says.\n\nNot Designed for Timing\n\nBut just because investors are now able to make more-frequent adjustments to their investment holdings doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they should, says Joseph Hurley, founder of financial-planning site Savingforcollege.com, who writes frequently on 529s.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really expect to see a lot of people changing their investments two times a year,\u201d Mr. Hurley says.\n\nThat\u2019s because regular tweaking simply isn\u2019t necessary for most investors, he says. Many people select an automatic age-based option that starts out heavy on stocks and shifts toward fixed income as the beneficiary approaches college age, he says. Others replicate this age-based approach on their own, adjusting the allocation annually. And those who adhere to a static allocation strategy need not rebalance more than once a year, he says.\n\nThe 529 plans \u201care really not designed for self-directed investors, or those who like to shift their investments frequently,\u201d Mr. Hurley says. Instead, he says, investors are better off keeping the long view in mind than reacting to fluctuations in the market.\n\nThe state 529 plans, which are named for the section of the federal tax code that created them in 1996, are a way for parents and others to finance college or graduate school with tax-free funds. The 529s typically invest in mutual funds, and withdrawals that are used to pay for qualified higher-education expenses generally aren\u2019t subject to taxation. The funds have $244.5 billion in assets.\n\nPsychological Reasons\n\nThe underlying reason for investors wanting more windows to make changes might be more psychological than practical. Investors don\u2019t want to feel as locked in as they were, says Mr. Hurley. \u201cIt\u2019s really just a matter of having some options available to you should you desire to make a change.\u201d\n\nThe new rule for 529s was included in the Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act, the primary purpose of which was to create tax-free accounts to save for disability-related expenses. The twice-yearly provision in that law was made to apply to existing college-plan 529s, too.\n\nMeanwhile, other restrictions on 529 movements remain intact under the new rules. For example, only one tax-free rollover from one 529 plan to another is allowed in a 12-month cycle. But again, changing the beneficiary is a way to get around the restriction.\n\nMs. Gellman is a reporter for TheWall Street Journal in New York.

(A recent proposal from President Barack Obama to curtail the tax benefits of new contributions to 529 plans was withdrawn quickly.)\n\nBut there are other tax breaks available for college expenses, for those who qualify based on their income. You can\u2019t claim them, though, for expenses you cover with money from a 529 plan.\n\nSo if you are eligible for these other credits, \u201ca big tax-planning mistake would be to take the total education expenses and withdraw that from the 529 plan,\u201d says Tom Fredrickson, founder of Fredrickson Financial Planning in New York.\n\nFiguring out whether you qualify for various tax breaks will help you determine which expenses to pay with money from your 529 account and which expenses to pay out of regular savings, cash flow or loans.\n\nBig Opportunity\n\nThree of the most valuable tax benefits for education are the American Opportunity tax credit, Lifetime Learning credit, and tuition-and-fees deduction. The tuition-and-fees deduction has expired for 2015, but it\u2019s a provision that Congress tends to resuscitate at year-end. (It had also expired for 2014 but was extended in December.)\n\nThese three are mutually exclusive, meaning you can\u2019t use more than one per student. For most eligible taxpayers, the American Opportunity credit is the most valuable, says Mark Kantrowitz, senior vice president and publisher of Edvisors.com, a consumer-information website based in Las Vegas.\n\nThe American Opportunity credit can reduce your tax bill by as much as $2,500, more than most taxpayers can save with either of the other two options. Also, while the American Opportunity credit is unavailable to wealthier taxpayers, the income limits are higher than those for the Lifetime Learning credit and tuition-and-fees deduction. If your income is below the level where the American Opportunity tax credit starts to phase out, \u201cit\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d Mr. Kantrowitz says. Except in rare cases, he says, \u201cthe AOTC is going to yield more financial benefits.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re eligible for the American Opportunity tax credit, you can maximize your tax benefits by planning to spend $4,000 from your cash, regular savings or loan proceeds on qualified education expenses. Then, any remaining expenses can be paid with money from your 529 plan.\n\nWhy $4,000? You can claim an American Opportunity tax credit for 100% of the first $2,000 of qualified education expenses, plus 25% of the next $2,000.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to leave the tax credit on the table by paying for everything out of the 529 plan,\u201d says Maura Griffin, founder of Blue Spark Capital Advisors in New York.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to consider financial aid and other education benefits, such as scholarships and grants. Any of those that are tax-free will reduce your qualified expenses. After taking those benefits into account, focus on finding expenses that qualify for the American Opportunity credit, Mr. Kantrowitz says, adding that \u201c529 plans have the broadest definition of qualified expenses, so you\u2019d first focus on the AOTC.\u201d For example, room and board isn\u2019t a qualified expense under the American Opportunity credit but generally is for 529-plan distributions.\n\nIncome Limits\n\nOf course, you won\u2019t qualify for the American Opportunity credit, the Lifetime Learning credit, or a tuition-and-fees deduction if your income is too high. The American Opportunity credit, with the highest threshold, is unavailable for those with modified adjusted gross income above $90,000, or $180,000 for joint filers. (Modified adjusted gross income is adjusted gross income plus foreign income and some other income added back.)\n\nAmerican Opportunity tax credits are reduced for those with modified adjusted gross income between $80,000 and $90,000, or between $160,000 and $180,000 for joint filers. If your income is in those ranges, the benefit essentially is halved, Mr. Kantrowitz says. Instead of a credit for 100% of the first $2,000 of qualified expenses and 25% of the second $2,000, \u201cit\u2019s effectively 50% of the first $2,000, 12.5% of the second $2,000,\u201d he says.\n\nThat might mean that taking money out of your 529 plan will give you a bigger tax benefit, depending on your tax bracket and other factors. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the income phase-outs I suggest you do the calculations to see what the benefit is each way,\u201d he says.\n\nIf you do that, remember that for federal taxes you only benefit from a tax break on the earnings in your 529 plan, not the contributions, since the contributions were made with after-tax money.\n\nSay, for example, one-third of your 529 withdrawal is earnings. If you are in the 25% tax bracket, the tax benefit of that 529 money is 25% of one-third of the amount you withdraw, or a little more than 8 cents per dollar of education expenses. Check your state\u2019s rules for possible additional tax benefits.\n\nMs. Coombes is a writer in San Francisco.

Photo: NRG\n\nWhen they were first launched, \u201cyieldcos\u201d lit up the stock market like fireworks with their impressive dividends and the prospect of even higher yields to come. But these new renewable-energy stocks flamed out as dramatically as they appeared, and it now looks as though many may fall short of the hopes of yield-seeking investors.\n\nFor a decade or more before yieldcos came along, it was one of the biggest enigmas on Wall Street: The world\u2019s largest economies were shifting their electricity grids to renewable-energy sources, but investors and corporations, with rare exceptions, couldn\u2019t seem to make a buck on the energy revolution.\n\nOn the stock market, investors had two choices on renewable energy. They could buy into startups and hope the companies eventually recouped the high upfront costs of building solar-panel factories or wind farms. Or they could buy a stock where the renewable-energy business was hidden inside a larger entity. But if you wanted to get into the sector via utilities developing renewable-energy sources, \u201cyou would have been investing in a lot more than renewables,\u201d says Jeffrey Cohen, a partner in the New York office of London law firm Linklaters who worked on the launch of one of the first U.S.-listed yieldcos, sponsored by Spanish utility Abengoa SA .\n\nThen came the yieldcos.\n\nLightbulb goes on\n\nEarly in the 2000s, somewhere on Wall Street or in the City of London financial district\u2014nobody seems to know for certain who invented the yieldco\u2014a clean-powered lightbulb went on in a financial engineer\u2019s head. Many power companies had long-term contracts with electric grids to draw power from solar farms and wind farms the utilities had built. Now, bankers would help the utilities sell that guaranteed revenue stream to yield-starved fixed-income investors, through separate entities that came to be known as yieldcos. The proceeds would give the utilities capital to cover the startup costs of their next renewable projects.\n\nLike a real-estate investment trust or master limited partnership, each yieldco stated in its prospectus that it would pay out the majority of its revenue in quarterly dividends. Intuitively, that similarity to an MLP\u2014an investor darling during the latest oil boom\u2014made sense for renewable energy. \u201cRenewables have a lot of characteristics oil and gas had, which is a very predictable and steady cash flow, and a desire on behalf of some investors to have cash flow separated from, in the oil and gas context, exploration and development activities, and in renewable energy, the construction activity,\u201d Mr. Cohen says.\n\nThe first U.S.-listed yieldco was NRG Yield Inc., which sold $495 million of shares in its initial public offering in July 2013. Abengoa Yield PLC followed it to market the next year. They were stock-market hits, jumping well above their IPO prices.\n\n\u201cYieldcos offer an attractive mix of above-average dividend yield and strong long-term growth fundamentals for renewable energy,\u201d said analysts at brokerage firm Morgan Stanley, in a research note in June of this year. Even if tax subsidies for renewable energy were reduced, the analysts said, wind power would remain one of the cheapest ways to produce electricity in the central U.S. The Morgan Stanley analysts also noted another attractive component of yieldcos\u2014the promise of dividend increases. In its prospectus, NRG Yield targeted annual dividend growth of 10% to 15%, in anticipation of revenue from new projects. Others made even more tempting promises.\n\nToo good to be true\n\nIn theory, yieldcos combined the safety of a steady revenue stream and the sexiness of a fast-growing company, in an era when these companies\u2019 5%-plus yields have been almost impossible to find elsewhere. In the 30 months following NRG Yield\u2019s launch, about $28 billion was raised in yieldco IPOs, according to Bloomberg research.\n\nBut in the time-honored tradition of Wall Street, yieldcos sounded too good to be true precisely because they were.\n\n\u2018Some of the yieldcos may choose to reinvent themselves.\u2019 \u2014Jeffrey Cohen, partner at law firm Linklaters\n\nInvestors who piled in saw share prices drop in recent months as the answers to some questions about yieldcos emerged. Namely, who was going to pay for the new projects after the IPO money dried up? (Answer: the investors, whose stakes would be diluted by new offerings of yieldco stock.) What would happen to the construction costs for solar-panel complexes and wind farms when billions of dollars of newly raised capital started chasing the builders? (Answer: They would shoot higher.) Would yieldco investors sit tight as interest-rate increases loomed or flee like many other utility investors? (Answer: They ran for the hills.)\n\nDimmer lights\n\nGlobal X YieldCo Index ETF (YLCO), a basket of the new stocks, is down 27% since its launch earlier this year. Unable to tap the stock market because of waning demand from investors, some utilities are reining in their plans for new projects at their yieldcos. Without new projects, most yieldcos won\u2019t be able to raise dividends as planned.\n\n\u201cSome of the yieldcos may choose to reinvent themselves,\u201d says Mr. Cohen, of Linklaters. For some, that could mean distributing less of their cash to investors and using it instead to invest in new projects. \u201cAlternatively, they could just say \u2018OK, there\u2019s just not going to be the level of [dividend] growth we\u2019d hoped in the next couple years and when the right environment comes back we will grow the dividend,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Cohen says.\n\nStephen Byrd, a utilities and renewable-energy analyst at Morgan Stanley, says the firm remains optimistic about most yieldcos. Those with strong sponsors and a suite of domestic assets should be able to keep their dividend promises, he says, because institutional investors eventually will have an appetite for new equity issues from them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy to find assets with 20-year contracts with strong customers,\u201d Mr. Byrd says. \u201cThat\u2019s an asset class of enduring value that I think value investors will always be attracted to.\u201d\n\nMr. Curran, a writer in Denton, Texas, is a regular contributor to Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.

(Only actively managed funds qualify; index funds, exchange-traded funds and leveraged funds don\u2019t.)\n\nSuitably enough, this quarter\u2019s honors went to a fund whose managers describe its strategy as revolving around picking stocks they can own for the next five to 10 years, not what is going to be in or out of favor in a quarter or year.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re not into top-down\u2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not into top-down investment decisions or making big-picture predictions about what will happen with the market,\u201d says Daniel Davidowitz, chief investment officer of Polen Capital of Boca Raton, Fla., and manager of the $543 million Polen Growth Fund (POLIX). \u201cWe want to own what is right, regardless of the season or the climate. And right now, our portfolio is still generating earnings growth in the midteens, on a percentage basis.\u201d\n\nDaniel Davidowitz, whose Polen Growth fund is No. 1 for the past 12 months, picks stocks rather than worry about \u2018big-picture predictions\u2019 for the market. Photo: Mike Jurus\n\nAnd stocks like that are what investors are flocking to in what has become a more perilous market environment. As a result, the fund that Mr. Davidowitz runs with the assistance of Damon Ficklin, a portfolio manager and analyst at Polen Capital, ended with a 16.9% return for the trailing 12 months, more than two full percentage points ahead of its nearest rival.\n\nEven so, that is down from the 19.3% return it had posted as recently as Sept. 22, only six trading days before the end of the quarter. At that point, the Polen fund was in third place, just behind Lord Abbett Micro Cap Growth Fund (LMIYX), which at the time boasted a 19.4% return.\n\nBy the end of the quarter, however, the Lord Abbett fund\u2014a repeat winner of this competition, but which has owned many small biotech and tech stocks of the kind that have taken a battering lately\u2014was ranked 23rd, posting a 12-month gain of only 10.1%.\n\nThe fund that finished second in this quarter\u2019s survey, Emerald Growth (HSPGX), which led the pack with a 19.7% return as of Sept. 22, ended with a 14.8% gain.\n\nPolen Growth\u2019s Damon Ficklin says of its success with Starbucks stock: \u2018How many new companies have created a global brand in the last 10 years?\u2019 Photo: Mike Jurus\n\nFor the Polen fund\u2019s managers, the third quarter\u2019s turbulence underscores that they\u2019re on the right track: that the key to long-term success is to build a concentrated portfolio of blue-chip growth stocks in which they have a high degree of conviction.\n\n\u201cWe own only about 20 companies at any point in time; over the life of the strategy, since 1989, we have owned only 105 stocks,\u201d says Mr. Davidowitz. They\u2019ll also hang on to those stocks for years, in search of compound growth.\n\nJolt from Starbucks\n\nThe result of Polen\u2019s quest to find companies with an outsize competitive advantage and a cash-rich balance sheet is a list of portfolio companies dominated by household names like Starbucks Corp. , Nike Inc. and Google Inc. (trading as Alphabet Inc. as of today) that Mr. Davidowitz says have a return on capital that collectively is north of 20%, or double the average for the U.S. market. \u201cThey all have more free cash flow than they need to run their business, real revenue growth and true, secular earnings growth,\u201d he adds.\n\nStarbucks has soared some 300% in the five years since Polen added it to the portfolio, and 51% over the past 12 months, making it one of the biggest contributors to the fund\u2019s top-tier performance. \u201cThe company has delivered earnings per share growth of 15% to 20%, and very consistently strong same-store comparisons,\u201d says Mr. Ficklin. It is the coffee retailer\u2019s global expansion that the team finds particularly compelling, he adds. \u201cHow many new companies have created a global brand in the last 10 years?\u201d Turmoil in China\u2014a major source of growth for Starbucks\u2014doesn\u2019t rattle him. \u201cChina still doesn\u2019t have the routine of a daily morning coffee run,\u201d he points out. \u201cThis is a secular growth story.\u201d\n\nNike is another major Polen Capital holding that continues to fare well in China. \u201cIf you have something unique and special that is of value to Chinese consumers, you will be rewarded,\u201d says Mr. Davidowitz of Nike, which has climbed 36.6% over the past 12 months. Polen regretted having sold Nike too early in 2007 after a big run-up, and used the stock\u2019s weakness in mid-2012 to add to its holdings.\n\nMore recently, Polen has boosted its holdings in Google when the latter was a laggard. While Mr. Davidowitz says it didn\u2019t contribute as much to the fund\u2019s 12-month performance as other holdings, he expects the stock to be a plus for investors going forward.\n\n\u201cPart of the problem with Google has been the difficulty the market has had in predicting earnings because the company doesn\u2019t give guidance,\u201d he says. The reorganization plans announced in August, separating Google\u2019s core businesses from those that require more capital, should boost transparency, he adds. Meanwhile, he points out, \u201cthey have massive competitive advantages and revenues are growing at a rate of 20%, with ease.\n\nNot all of the firm\u2019s positions are household names. One is O\u2019Reilly Automotive Inc., the No. 4 auto-parts retailer and distributor, which Polen Capital\u2019s team believes will rapidly play catch-up to larger rivals like AutoZone Inc. as the sector consolidates. \u201cTheir model is to work with mechanics in what is still a mom-and-pop industry, and that has been very rewarding,\u201d he says.\n\nMs. McGee is a writer in New England.

Water disruptions potentially can have a significant effect on a company\u2019s supply chain. As a result, money managers, fund managers and individual investors are putting more weight on the potential for water shortages as a risk factor for investments.\n\nFour years ago, Daniel Wild and his team at RobecoSAM, a Swiss asset-management firm specializing in socially responsible finance, or sustainability investing, saw such a gap.\n\nFor instance, could a company like Nike Inc., which uses water-intensive cotton, be hit by drought or water scarcity in regions where it produces shoes and clothing? How would utilities such as nuclear power plants cool their facilities when groundwater and reservoirs are low and earmarked for public consumption?\n\nChecking exposure\n\n\u201cWhat we are trying to find out is whether companies are aware of their own exposure to water risks and whether they are taking appropriate measures,\u201d says Mr. Wild, a former water engineer whose firm works with S&P Dow Jones Indices to publish the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices. \u201cWe ask how companies address water, what do they know, how do they quantify what they know, what are their Plan B\u2019s?\u201d (News Corp\u2019s Dow Jones & Co., which publishes The Wall Street Journal, formerly had a stake in S&P Dow Jones Indices.)\n\nMr. Wild and his team ended up tweaking their existing assessment weighing environmental, social and governance factors to include a greater emphasis on water. These include how companies save water or how they deal with local water regulators.\n\nOthers have since followed suit, helping investors assess whether their portfolios could suffer, or benefit, from such environmental concerns as droughts, tighter regulatory environments and new infrastructure needs.\n\nThe fund-research firm Morningstar Inc. recently said it plans to start grading all mutual and exchange-traded funds on environmental, social and governance factors, not just funds that identify themselves as sustainable or socially responsible. The company cited as a main driver for the move a study by Morgan Stanley \u2019s Institute for Sustainable Investing, which found 71% of individual investors are interested in sustainable investing.\n\nDroughts in Brazil inspired Marcello Siniscalchi, chief investment officer at Brazil\u2019s Ita\u00fa Asset Management, to design a stress test for global companies that assumes water will become scarcer, costlier and more regulated.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is suppose in the next 10 years that this [situation of shrinking water supplies] will be universal,\u201d he says, adding that he can also forecast the impact that an event such as water rationing could have on a country\u2019s GDP or inflation rates.\n\nMonika Freyman, senior manager of the Water Program at the Boston-based nonprofit Ceres, co-wrote a report titled \u201cAn Investor Handbook for Water Integration,\u201d which looks at risks investors face from water scarcity and the need to incorporate water issues into their investment strategies. The report surveyed 35 managers and owners from around the world with assets ranging from $100 million to $950 billion.\n\nAmong other things, the report advocates incorporating water risk into analyst buy/sell decisions for specific companies and increasing corporate disclosure on water-management plans.\n\nThere can be ways for investors to benefit from water scarcity. Photo: MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA \u2018water-risk filter\u2019\n\n\u201cInvestors have the duty and responsibility to do this analysis. They should engage their money managers on these questions and ask if they have a water-risk filter,\u201d says Ms. Freyman, who adds that investment firms are just waking up to concerns about global water risks. \u201cEven if investors don\u2019t have all the data, they can still make assumptions on exposure to water risks for specific sectors and locations with help from third-party research providers,\u201d she says.\n\nThere are some free ways that investors can gauge if their portfolios are exposed to water risks. The World Resource Institute\u2019s Aqueduct mapping tool shows what parts of the world are experiencing water stress and makes forecasts about water risks. London-based CDP produces an annual report using individual company data to assess whether and how companies are managing freshwater resources. And the WWF, or World Wildlife Fund, has produced a water-risk questionnaire that helps investors and companies identify water risks in supply chains and investment portfolios.\n\nThere can also be ways for investors to benefit from water scarcity. Funds in this niche invest in companies that provide solutions to global water problems, typically in terms of repairing or improving water infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIn the U.S. alone, a water main breaks every other minute, and it is increasingly being shown on TV,\u201d says Matt Sheldon, co-portfolio manager of Calvert Global Water Fund (CFWAX). \u201cWhile water infrastructure is generally \u2018out of sight, out of mind,\u2019 it is increasingly in sight, and usually in a bad way. Given its criticality, when water infrastructure breaks, it gets fixed.\u201d\n\nMr. Davidson is a writer in San Francisco.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/4-mistakes-people-make-with-stock-options-1436185898", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Illustration: Jason Schneider for The wall Street Journal\n\nCompany stock options can be a source of great wealth. They can also be a source of great confusion.\n\nAll too often, people don\u2019t read statements about how their options work\u2014whether because the explanations seem opaque or there simply aren\u2019t enough hours in the day to squeeze in another chore.\n\nAnd that can lead to big problems, because options come with many complex rules attached\u2014and ignoring them can have serious consequences for people\u2019s portfolios. People can end up facing substantial tax hits, taking on unnecessary risk or even losing the right to exercise the options entirely.\n\nBelow, financial advisers weigh in on some of the risks and fine print that people frequently overlook.\n\n1. The company can change the terms of your options.\n\nWhen employees are fired or retire, many companies change the terms of their options, so they have less time to exercise them. This means the employee has less time for the options to appreciate in value or recover if underwater. In a worst-case scenario, the options would simply expire and the employee would be none the wiser. Employees who aren\u2019t aware of these provisions \u201cmay find a great deal of their option wealth expiring in a short period,\u201d says John Voltaggio, managing director at Northern Trust in New York.\n\nFor example, Mr. Voltaggio worked with an executive who was retiring. The executive learned that certain option grants wouldn\u2019t fully vest, and of his vested options, their term was reduced. As a result, the 100,000 options granted to him shrank to 60,000\u2014leaving him with significantly less net wealth than he had planned on, and less time to exercise the options.\n\nHad he been aware of the terms of the options, Mr. Voltaggio says, he would have begun to exercise them sooner.\n\n2. You need a strategy to make options work.\n\nPeople too often believe that their company\u2019s stock will continue to increase in value and they can wait until the last minute to exercise their options, says Joe Heider, founder of Cirrus Wealth Management in Cleveland.\n\n\u201cBut many times, such as what happened to many folks\u2019 options in 2008, the option will actually fall out of the money and expire worthless,\u201d he says.\n\nConsider a client of Sandra Bragar, who is director, wealth management at Aspiriant in San Francisco. The client lost track of her stock options\u2019 expiration date and then needed to act quickly to exercise them. But the client was a high-level executive at a publicly traded company subject to Securities and Exchange Commission filing requirements. And the trading window for insiders wasn\u2019t going to be open before the stock options expired.\n\nSo the client was forced to exercise and hold the stock options, when she otherwise would have preferred to sell them\u2014and she had to come up with $200,000 to cover the exercise price. She didn\u2019t have that much cash available and was forced to use margin.\n\nThings ended well, Ms. Bragar says: When the trading window opened a couple of months later, the client sold the shares and paid off the margin loan. But things could easily have gone badly. If the stock had taken a big tumble between the time of exercise and the delayed sale date, the client would have been forced to cover the margin out of her own pocket.\n\n\u201cKeep track of option expiration dates and develop an exercise plan for them at least 12 months in advance,\u201d says Ms. Bragar.\n\n3. Options aren\u2019t stocks.\n\nMany people don\u2019t realize options are inherently riskier than common shares, says Mr. Voltaggio. When employees look to diversify, they often sell their common shares before exercising options that are worth money. This can be a mistake, Mr. Voltaggio says.\n\nWhy? While options carry a great deal of upside leverage, they can also expire worthless during a downturn in the market. This can be an especially big mistake if an oversize portion of your retirement savings is concentrated in your company\u2019s stock options, says Paul Palazzo, managing director at Altfest Personal Wealth Management in New York. In contrast, if you hold common shares, they can recover their value over time.\n\nThere are other reasons to hold on to stocks rather than options. Common shares may pay a dividend, whereas options never do. And the appreciation realized in the option will be subject to ordinary income tax, but the appreciation in common shares faces capital-gains tax treatment, Mr. Voltaggio says.\n\nHe advises exercising options 75% of the way through their term\u2014a reasonable period of time to allow the options to realize their potential, but not too close to expiration, where a short-term drop in price could render them worthless.\n\n4. Not all options are taxed the same.\n\nThe most common type of stock-option grants are nonqualified stock-option grants, which are subject to regular income tax when they\u2019re exercised. However, some people also receive qualified or incentive stock options, known as ISOs.\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe spread on these options isn\u2019t subject to regular income tax, but to secure the more favorable taxation, the options are subject to a greater number of rules and restrictions that many people aren\u2019t aware of, Mr. Voltaggio says.\n\nFor example, while ISOs can avoid regular income tax, the spread on ISOs is subject to the alternative minimum tax. Also, people need to hold the shares received upon an ISO exercise for a least one year from the date they were exercised and at least two years from the date they were granted to maintain the favorable tax treatment, Mr. Voltaggio says. If people sell their stock before meeting those minimums, the spread will be subject to ordinary income tax, he says.\n\nMs. Dagher is a reporter at The Wall Street Journal in New York.

When was his or her first fund bought, on average?\n\nThis month, we ask questions about mutual-fund investors\u2019 demographics, taken from the just-released 2015 Investment Company Fact Book. The book, based on 2014 data, has hundreds of figures that offer a snapshot of the American fund investor.\n\nHow well do you know funds? Take the quiz:\n\n1. Mutual-fund companies are often called families. But real families\u2014individual investors\u2014own the funds. What percentage of U.S. mutual-fund investors are married or living with a partner?\n\nA. 21%\n\nB. 37%\n\nC. 59%\n\nD. 73%\n\nAnswer: D. Nearly three-quarters of all mutual-fund investors are either married or living with a partner, according to the Investment Company Institute\u2019s latest publication. And that makes sense based on fund investors\u2019 typical ages. The median age for these investors is 51. In fact, in addition to being partnered, the typical mutual-fund owner is middle-aged, employed and educated, and shares investment decision making with his or her spouse or partner, according to a separate ICI survey tracking mutual-fund ownership that was published in February. Investors in exchange-traded funds have a similar profile when it comes to relationship status and age: They, too, have a median age of 51, and 73% of them are married or living with a partner.\n\n2. What is the median number of funds owned by U.S. households?\n\nA. 4\n\nB. 6\n\nC. 8\n\nD. 12\n\nAnswer: A. The median number of funds owned by U.S. households was four at the end of 2014, up from three at the end of 2013.\n\n3. Both institutions and individuals (households) can own mutual funds. In the U.S., what percentage of long-term mutual funds\u2019 assets are held by households?\n\nA. 23%\n\nB. 45%\n\nC. 77%\n\nD. 95%\n\nAnswer: D. In the U.S., households own the vast majority of long-term mutual funds, which include stock, bond and hybrid funds (and don\u2019t include money-market funds). Since households predominantly hold these funds, \u201cthat provides a stable investor base\u201d because they are looking long term with their investments, says Chris Plantier, an ICI senior economist who is also part of the team that produces the annual fact books.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\n4. How much demand was there for U.S.-based mutual funds in 2014?\n\nA. Mutual funds drew in $77 billion.\n\nB. They drew in $96 billion.\n\nC. They drew in $102 billion.\n\nD. They drew in $146 billion.\n\nAnswer: C. And of this $102 billion in net flows into mutual funds, $96 billion went into stock, bond and hybrid funds, and the rest into money-market funds, according to ICI. Stock funds pulled in $25 billion, while bond funds pulled in $44 billion.\n\n5. Fill in the blank. Nearly 50% of fund investors bought their mutual funds before the year ____.\n\nA. 1983\n\nB. 1995\n\nC. 2001\n\nD. 2008\n\nAnswer: B. Such a big chunk of investors bought their mutual funds 20 years ago because many of them are baby boomers. \u201cA lot of your baby boomers would have been in high-earning years in the 1990s,\u201d says the ICI\u2019s Mr. Plantier. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising when you think about the fact that baby boomers really were the first cohort\u201d to go through the 401(k) and IRA retirement system, he adds. About half of assets in 401(k)s are invested in mutual funds, according to ICI.\n\nHe adds that baby boomers\u2019 high-earning years coincided with when mutual funds first came into popularity: the 1980s and 1990s. About 42% of mutual-fund-owning households are headed by baby boomers, according to ICI.\n\n6. What percentage of long-term mutual fund assets is in retirement accounts?\n\nA. 16%\n\nB. 27%\n\nC. 53%\n\nD. 65%\n\nAnswer: C. More than half of long-term mutual-fund assets are held in retirement accounts. Overall, total retirement-market assets equaled a robust $24.7 trillion at the end of 2014, up from $23.3 trillion at the end of 2013. An estimated $7.4 trillion of that was in IRAs, while defined-contribution-plan assets totaled $6.8 trillion at the end of last year.\n\n7. What percentage of mutual-fund-owning households have Internet access?\n\nA. 93%\n\nB. 97%\n\nC. 95%\n\nD. 94%\n\nAnswer: D. At latest count, 94% of mutual-fund-owning households have access to the Internet. Of course, patterns among this group reflect society overall. Still, older households use the Internet less, and younger ones use it more, says the ICI\u2019s Mr. Plantier.\n\n8. How many U.S. households own mutual funds?\n\nA. 25.9 million\n\nB. 44.6 million\n\nC. 53.2 million\n\nD. 63.8 million\n\nAnswer: C. About 53.2 million households, or 43%, hold mutual funds. The typical mutual-fund investor, according to an ICI survey, has about $85,000 in household income and $200,000 in household financial assets.\n\n9. How many assets are there world-wide in mutual funds and ETFs?\n\nA. $27.2 trillion\n\nB. $33.4 trillion\n\nC. $67.9 trillion\n\nD. $99 trillion\n\nAnswer: B. Of the $33.4 trillion in assets in regulated mutual funds and ETFs, more than 80% is domiciled in the U.S. and Europe. At the end of 2014, nearly $18 trillion was in U.S. mutual funds and ETFs, with about $15.9 trillion and $2 trillion in assets, respectively.\n\n10. At the end of 2014, how many ETFs were there?\n\nA. 798\n\nB. 956\n\nC. 1,451\n\nD. 2,018\n\nAnswer: C. The number of ETFs now\u20141,451\u2014is seven times as large as the number at the end of 2005, when there were just 204 ETFs. Early in 2015, ETFs\u2019 assets surpassed the $2 trillion mark, up from $1 trillion at the end of 2011, according to the ICI. However, ETFs still have a lot of catching up to do with mutual funds, which dominate in retirement plans.\n\nMs. McCarthy is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

WSJ's Veronica Dagher offers tips on hurdles to avoid. Photo: Boris Zerwann/iStock/Getty Images\n\nPeople who are passionate about a cause typically have several options. They can volunteer their time. They can donate money to a charitable organization.\n\nOr, if they are especially passionate and ambitious, they can start a charity.\n\nBut passion and ambition are only part of the battle. Starting and running a nonprofit is a complicated business, and one that nonprofit experts say individuals all too often seriously underestimate\u2014from raising money and choosing the right board members to filing paperwork correctly. Such shortcomings can lead to costly mistakes, ultimate failures, and sometimes even personal lawsuits against well-meaning but nevertheless unprepared philanthropists.\n\nHere are four common mistakes people make when they start a charity\u2014and how to avoid them:\n\nThe Mistake: Not doing your research\n\nDesiree Adaway, a nonprofit consultant in Asheville, N.C., worked with a woman who wanted to start a charity to help \u201cbaby animals.\u201d The woman\u2019s intentions were good; she felt passionate about the animals and wanted to give back. But three similar charities already served the area, not to mention the national charities doing the same work. The woman also knew nothing about running a nonprofit.\n\nRunning a charity requires a lot of time and some specific skills, Ms. Adaway says. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to play with the baby animals every day when you\u2019re the executive director.\u201d\n\nThe Fix: Find out if there are charities with similar missions and research them thoroughly before deciding there is always room for one more. There may not be a need for yours, says Ms. Adaway.\n\nBefore launching, get the kind of work and management experience you will need, and be aware of the time commitment that will be necessary. Volunteer at a similar organization, especially on critical tasks such as fundraising and event planning. Try to serve on a nonprofit board and speak to other nonprofit founders about the challenges they\u2019ve faced, she says. Have a business plan and a mission statement for the charity, too.\n\nThe woman who thought about starting her own charity for animals decided in the end not to proceed, Ms. Adaway says, after she eventually realized that \u201cpassion for a cause isn\u2019t enough.\u201d\n\nThe Mistake: Underestimating the paperwork\n\nA lot of people don\u2019t understand how much paperwork is required to start and run a nonprofit, says Rich Dietz, senior manager for digital fundraising at Abila, a software company for nonprofits and associations.\n\nTo gain official, tax-exempt status as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, groups must register with state, and in some cases local, agencies, and the Internal Revenue Service, says the Austin-based Mr. Dietz. The IRS alone can take six to nine months. And until that status is official, it can be difficult to raise money, he says, since donors can\u2019t be guaranteed that they\u2019ll be able to write off their gifts.\n\nLack of proper insurance is another issue that can cause nightmares for the ill-prepared. Mr. Dietz recalls a startup charity that hosted a bicycle race in which a participant was seriously injured and the charity didn\u2019t have proper insurance. The charity was sued. All the board members had to help pay the legal fees and had liens on their homes while the suit was pursued.\n\nThe Fix: \u201cProper planning,\u201d Mr. Dietz says. Realize it may take much longer than you expect to receive the tax status you desire. Make sure that you\u2019ve got the proper insurance right away and that you\u2019re not cutting costs now that will cost you dearly in the long run. Keep good records to track where money is coming from and how it is being used to keep donors happy, he says.\n\nWhile waiting for 501(c)(3) status to be granted, Mr. Dietz adds, a startup charity can in some cases find another charity that will accept donations on its behalf until official status is granted.\n\nThe Mistake: Picking the wrong board members\n\nMany individuals choose relatives as board members for their charity startups, often just because it\u2019s easy or because they think it would be fun to involve family.\n\nThis is a mistake, consultants say: Your relatives may have no interest in being involved in the charity, they may know nothing about the cause, and they may not be able to help raise funds. It can also pose a problem if the founder leaves the charity and the relatives don\u2019t want to continue, says Ms. Adaway, the nonprofit consultant.\n\nThe Fix: Find board members with skills that can advance the organization. Attorneys, accountants and fundraisers can help a startup that may not have the funds to hire such experts, she says.\n\n\u201cMake sure they have a real passion for your organization and understand they are the fiduciaries who steer the organization toward a sustainable future by adopting a sound, ethical and legal governance and financial management structure,\u201d Ms. Adaway says.\n\nAll board members also should be expected to donate to the charity. \u201cMany foundations won\u2019t even make a grant to a nonprofit if all the board members aren\u2019t giving,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Mistake: Discounting the need for fundraising\n\nMany new organizations spend a majority of time on programming when they need to spend at least an equal amount of time raising money, says Suzanne Culhane, a fundraising consultant in Greenwich, Conn. Without proper fundraising there won\u2019t be programs, she says.\n\n\u201cThey should have at least one year of operating funds in place before implementing programs,\u201d Ms. Culhane says.\n\nMany also mistakenly target foundations as the major source for their funding, she says. \u201cIndividuals are the largest source of charitable contributions,\u201d she says, citing a recent study by the Giving USA Foundation, a Chicago-based nonprofit.\n\nThe Fix: Startup nonprofits should cultivate a donor base starting with their own individual contacts, she says. They also need to understand the organizations they are competing with for donor dollars, and understand how those charities are funded. This knowledge will help them identify prospective donors and help them avoid untested fundraising strategies, Ms. Culhane says.\n\nMs. Dagher is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-millennials-move-back-home-1442802323", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Illustration: Lou Beach for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMore millennials are spending early adulthood in the same place where they spent their formative years: in their parents\u2019 homes.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial that both parties understand the financial implications of this homecoming. For parents, a child\u2019s return often means a greater financial burden, just as the parents may be struggling to meet their own savings and retirement goals. It also can make it more difficult for the millennials to acquire the financial skills they\u2019ll need later in life.\n\nAccording to a recent study by PEW Research Center, the percentage of 18- to 34-year-olds living with their parents is higher today than it has been in decades. Currently, 26% are back in the nest, up from 22% in 2007. The rise has occurred among both high-school and college graduates, and has continued since the recession\u2019s end, despite the fact that millennials are earning more and have a lower unemployment rate than they did a few years ago.\n\nOf potentially greater concern is a related trend that shows parents are providing financial support to children long after they turn 21. According to a 2013 poll of parents by Clark University in Worcester, Mass., 56% of parents of 26- to 29-year-olds provide those children with at least occasional financial support.\n\n\u201cPeople used to make jokes about moving back in with mom and dad, but we have come to recognize that it takes longer to attain full adulthood than it used to,\u201d says Jeffrey Arnett, a psychology professor at Clark. Prof. Arnett attributes this change to rising levels of education and student debt.\n\nRetirement savings\n\nStill, parents may not be considering the risk to their retirement savings when they continue to support adult children, says Cheryl Sherrard, director of financial planning at Clearview Wealth Management in Charlotte, N.C.\n\nBenjamin Tobias, president of Tobias Financial Advisors in Plantation, Fla., provides an illustration: A 50-year-old couple who spends $12,500 a year to support an adult child will see their odds of success in retirement fall to 75% from 80%, assuming the child lives with them for four years. (The example assumes the couple has stockpiled $800,000 by age 50, earns investment returns of 6% a year, saves 15% of their $150,000 income once the child moves out, and expects to retire at 65 and spend $90,000 a year in retirement.) \u201cThe impact can be significant,\u201d says Mr. Tobias.\n\nIn addition, there\u2019s the risk that young adults who are still financially dependent on their parents will fail to develop skills necessary to achieving financial independence. Parents who continue to help with an adult child\u2019s expenses can enable a lifestyle the child otherwise wouldn't be able to afford, says Sheila Padden, a financial adviser in Chicago.\n\nBefore an adult child moves home, experts say parents should figure out how much of the child\u2019s expenses they are willing or able to cover\u2014and for how long. Such costs typically range from $5,000 to $18,000 a year, advisers say, depending on whether only basics are covered, such as food, health and car insurance, or extras, too, including travel and entertainment.\n\nIf the child is unemployed, parents may have to pay for necessities, including food, health insurance and items required to conduct a job search, such as car insurance, gas and cellphone bills.\n\nPhoto: Sam Edwards/iStock/Getty Images\n\nMr. Tobias recommends setting up a monthly allowance from which the child must pay his or her share of family bills including insurance and cellphone service. The goal: To teach the child how to live on a budget and pay his or her bills on time.\n\nOthers agree it is vital to encourage adult children to assume responsibility for their own finances, even when living at home.\n\n\u201cLet them know that if their payment is late, they\u2019ll have to cover the late penalty,\u201d says Ms. Sherrard.\n\nCalculating rent\n\nTo motivate a child to find a job, many financial advisers recommend setting a limit on how long he or she can live at home rent-free. (For the same reason, many suggest gradually reducing a monthly allowance.)\n\nHow much rent to charge will depend, in part, on the parent\u2019s goals, as well as the child\u2019s. As a rule-of-thumb, Ms. Padden recommends parents charge 25% of the child\u2019s income, although if the child\u2019s goal is to pay down debt or build savings, parents might want to charge less.\n\nAt the same time, parents should take the opportunity to discuss budgeting\u2014and what percentage of the child\u2019s income to earmark for specific expenses, she says.\n\nThe trick, says Ms. Padden, is \u201cto provide a safety net without creating a disincentive for them to leave.\u201d\n\nDeadlines and discussions\n\nIf a child fails to find a job within a reasonable time, parents and child should discuss why that happened. In many cases, adult children can benefit from parents coaching them in job-search skills, like networking.\n\nIf a child is truly unmotivated, advisers say parents can take more drastic steps, such as cutting them off the family cellphone plan or car-insurance policy. \u201cThe inability to get around or text one\u2019s friends,\u201d says Ms. Sherrard, \u201cmay prod someone to at least find a temporary job.\u201d\n\nMs. Tergesen is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

But recent changes are making private loans attractive for more students\u2014in particular those with creditworthy parents who can qualify for lower rates than are available with federal loans.\n\nThese changes come as private lenders are looking to court young, lifelong customers who later will need mortgages and other banking and loan products. This is also largely why some lenders have rolled out refinancing options that can lower the interest rate on student loans, and loan modifications for some borrowers who are unable to make their payments.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal spoke with two college-loan experts about the key differences between the two types of loans and what parents and students should be aware of before they apply: Mark Kantrowitz, senior vice president at Edvisors.com, which tracks financial aid trends, and Dan Feshbach, chief executive at MeasureOne, which tracks student loans.\n\nHere are edited excerpts:\n\nWSJ: Who should consider federal loans?\n\nMR. KANTROWITZ: Undergraduates who are borrowing on their own, without help from their parents, should always choose federal loans. They are cheaper\u2014since everyone who gets approved gets the same fixed rate\u2014and have better repayment terms. If borrowers are unable to repay the loans because of a low salary or unemployment, they can qualify for repayment options that will keep them out of default, which can ruin their credit. Federal loans have more of these options than private loans.\n\nMR. FESHBACH: Pick a federal loan if you are concerned about your employment when you get out of school or if you see some reason in your financial future that might lead to needing to modify your payments. If, for example, you\u2019re going to school to be a social worker or a teacher, federal loans offer a lot of benefits, such as loan forgiveness in public-service jobs, which means you may not have to pay back the full amount.\n\nCheapest Federal Options\n\nWSJ: What are the cheapest federal loans and who can qualify for them?\n\nMR. KANTROWITZ: The federal government pays the interest on subsidized federal loans\u2014which include the subsidized Stafford loan and the Perkins loan\u2014while undergrads are in college and for the six and nine months, respectively, after graduation or after the student drops below halftime enrollment. The government also pays the interest during certain periods of deferment.\n\nLoan amounts are determined by the college financial-aid office, based on financial need. For borrowers who received the subsidized Stafford loan for the 2014-15 school year, the interest rate is 4.66%, plus an origination fee. The interest rate on the Stafford loan is likely to increase in 2015-16, at which point the Perkins loan is likely to once again be the lowest-cost federal education loan.\n\nWSJ: Who are private loans a good deal for?\n\nMR. FESHBACH: People with high credit scores, often at least around 740 on the FICO scale, which tops out at 850. Private loans are largely viewed as a family loan because cosigners are required in most cases. The federal government charges interest rates that aren\u2019t correlated with the likelihood of a creditworthy borrower defaulting. The federal Plus loan [which can be used by parents of undergraduate students or by grad students] for the current academic year has a 7.21% interest rate plus an origination fee. Many borrowers can qualify for a better rate and terms with private lenders.\n\nWSJ: How should borrowers compare the costs of these two types of loans?\n\nMR. KANTROWITZ: The first thing to compare is whether the loan has a fixed or variable rate. All new federal loans currently have fixed rates. Private lenders offer fixed and variable rates. The variable rates are the lowest, but could increase significantly over the next four to six years. Loan applicants should add four percentage points to the variable interest rate they\u2019re being offered to get a ballpark estimate of the average interest rate they\u2019re going to pay over the life of the loan, assuming a 10-year repayment term.\n\nIf you\u2019re planning on paying off that private loan in just a few years, then a variable rate may save you money compared with a fixed rate.\n\nAlso compare loan fees. There is a 1.073% origination fee for federal Stafford loans and a 4.292% fee for the federal Plus loan. These fees may rise for the coming school year by a small amount depending on Congress. Most private loans don\u2019t charge fees these days. Amortized over a 10-year term, 4% in fees is about the same as a one-percentage-point-higher interest rate.\n\nWSJ: What should borrowers keep in mind about repayment options?\n\nMR. KANTROWITZ: Federal loans allow borrowers to postpone payments for three years or longer through deferment or forbearance if they are facing a financial difficulty, like unemployment or medical expenses. Borrowers whose income is too low to pay their monthly bills in full can apply for income-based repayment or the pay-as-you-earn program, which lower the monthly payments.\n\nWith private loans, you\u2019re usually limited to no more than a year in total forbearance, typically in two-month increments. Some lenders extend repayment terms, which lowers the monthly payment [but increases a loan\u2019s total cost], and some allow for periods with interest-only payments followed by regular amortization. Lenders have been demonstrating increased flexibility in modifying terms of their loans for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.\n\nLower the Rate?\n\nWSJ: Can you ever lower the rate?\n\nMR. FESHBACH: Borrowers can consolidate federal student loans at StudentLoans.gov. The interest rate won't be lower, it will simply be the dollar-weighted average of the rates on the underlying loans [rounded up to the nearest one-eighth of a percentage point.]\n\nBorrowers retain the ability to use federal loan assistance programs, such as forbearance and income-based repayment. They may be able to lengthen the term of their loan, but the total amount they will pay over the life of the loan will increase.\n\nA number of private lenders will refinance private student loans. The pricing and terms are based [in part] on the applicant\u2019s credit history. Many with good credit histories and strong income may get a materially better rate than the rates on underlying loans. They may be able to extend the term of the loan as well.\n\nA small number of lenders, nonbanks and a few banks, are offering to refinance any combination of federal and private loans. Individuals who are refinancing federal loans into private loans will be giving up the borrower benefits offered by federal loans, such as the amount of eligible forbearance, debt forgiveness for public-service jobs, and some income-based programs. Private lenders target highly qualified borrowers who are unlikely to need or use such benefits. Borrowers wanting to refinance often need a cosigner to stay with them on the loan.\n\nWSJ: Does one loan leave parents more on the hook than another?\n\nMR. FESHBACH: If you [a parent] decide to cosign a private loan, you\u2019re signing on the dotted line to make a commitment to step in if your child can\u2019t make the payments.\n\nMR. KANTROWITZ: Parents who sign up for the federal Plus loan aren\u2019t eligible for income-based repayment or loan forgiveness\u2014so the difference between federal and private loans is much narrower for parents than students. Parents are on the hook either way, as the borrower of a federal Plus loan or as the cosigner of a private student loan.\n\nMs. Andriotis is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

The stock market, of course, has since roared back, with the S&P 500 index tripling in value since March 2009. The hope of every investor is to buy low and sell high. Myopic loss aversion causes us to do the opposite.\n\nWhat does this have to do with your smartphone? The main trigger of myopic loss aversion is frequent feedback. When people are frequently told how their investments are doing\u2014say, if they are given a daily update on their long-term investments, by smartphone or any other digital device\u2014they are more likely to make poor financial decisions and possibly sell at the wrong time.\n\nTo understand why, consider what you\u2019re likely to find if you monitor the S&P 500 index at different intervals. If you check every single day, there\u2019s a roughly 47% chance that the market will have gone down, based on its past movements. But what happens if you check once a month? The numbers will start to look a little better, as the market will only have gone down 41% of the time. Years are better still, as the S&P generates a positive return seven years out of every 10. And if you check once a decade, then you\u2019re only going to get bad news about 15% of the time.\n\nLosing safely\n\nThere\u2019s solid evidence that experiencing short-term losses\u2014noticing that your portfolio is losing money\u2014leads to poor choices.\n\nIn one lab experiment by professors Richard Thaler, Amos Tversky, Daniel Kahneman and Alan Schwartz, subjects were far more likely to invest in the safer option when feedback was given more frequently. Unfortunately, the safer investment also generated lower returns over the long haul.\n\nAs the researchers said, in a report published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 1997, \u201cProviding such investors with frequent feedback about their outcomes is likely to encourage their worst tendencies. \u2026More is not always better. The subjects with the most data did the worst in terms of money earned.\u201d\n\nThis brings me to the digital world. Given the profusion of connected devices, I think most people will end up looking at their investment portfolio far more frequently in the 21st century than they ever have before. Over time, this abundance of feedback might make us more vulnerable to myopic loss aversion, since the more often you check the S&P 500, the more likely it is to have gone down. In other words, our investment horizon might shrink to reflect the frequency of feedback.\n\nTo be sure, I\u2019m not making predictions about the future of the stock market: I have no idea what\u2019s going to happen. But I do wonder if we might soon reach a point where investors who get a high frequency of feedback aren\u2019t even willing to hold bonds, since bonds sometimes go down. They might insist on cash instead.\n\nPhoto: iStock/Getty Images\n\nSeeing the big picture\n\nWhile there is no cure for myopic loss aversion, there are some sensible steps we can take to reduce its impact. The first is to curate our digital world, ensuring that we aren\u2019t inundated with feedback we don\u2019t need. We should hide the stock app on our smartphones and avoid market updates on our smartwatches.\n\nAnd when we do look at our portfolio, it\u2019s important that we find ways to think about the bigger picture. Perhaps our 401(k) statement should highlight our projected income in retirement, and not the percentage gain or loss over the past year.\n\nBy helping people focus on the most meaningful variables of their financial lives, we can not only spare them unneeded worry, but also help them avoid costly investing mistakes.\n\nDr. Benartzi is a professor and co-chair of the Behavioral Decision Making Group at the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles, and author of \u201cThe Smarter Screen: Surprising Ways to Influence and Improve Online Behavior.\u201d He can be reached at reports@wsj.com.", "date": null, "title": "Keep Stock-Market Apps Off Your Phone"}

It\u2019s also about juggling large payouts from the stock awards and deferred compensation they may have accumulated over the years.\n\nExecutives can minimize the tax hit and smooth out income from such corporate perks in the early years of retirement, financial planners say, but it is important that they start the process one to two years before they plan to leave. Among other things, advisers recommend that executives take an inventory of what their short-term cash-flow needs will be in retirement and review company policies on how and when they can draw down deferred pay.\n\n\u201cFor many executives, the year they retire is their biggest salary ever because of all the lump-sum payments\u201d their plans mandate, says Lisa Brown, a financial adviser at Brightworth LLC in Atlanta who works with retiring executives. \u201cMap out your plan.\u201d\n\nTake a hypothetical executive with a $400,000 salary. In 2015, she exercises $40,000 of stock options and defers $50,000 of compensation to her company\u2019s nonqualified deferred-compensation plan. Her adjusted gross income for the year is $416,000, which also takes into account investment gains in her personal brokerage account.\n\nShe sets her retirement date for December 2016. At that time, according to her company plan, she\u2019ll trigger $600,000 of additional income for the year in the form of lump-sum payments from the deferred-compensation plan and accumulated company stock awards, boosting her adjusted gross income for the year she retires to more than $1 million.\n\nBy delaying the lump-sum payments until a few years into her retirement, when she is no longer drawing a salary, she could prevent her income from jumping so much in that first retirement year, says Ms. Brown.\n\nTo defer or not?\n\nExecutives should consider all of the short-term cash-flow needs that will come up in the early years of retirement, including any money they may need to pay the taxes on stock-option exercises and to fund health and insurance needs, says Cathy Schnaubelt, a senior wealth strategist in Houston for Atlanta-based Atlantic Trust.\n\nThose who have taken advantage of a nonqualified deferred-compensation plan in addition to their company\u2019s 401(k) may have a big decision to make. The nonqualified plans allow executives to defer part of their annual bonuses or other compensation to a point in the future, at which time it becomes taxable. Executives typically can elect to take this accumulated pay as a lump sum at retirement or opt instead to take payments starting five to 10 years after retirement and extending over time, essentially setting up an annuity-like income stream well into their retirement.\n\nMost plans require this election to be made at least 12 months in advance of an executive\u2019s retirement date, and it can\u2019t be changed once it\u2019s made.\n\nExecutives who plan to move to a no-income-tax state such as Florida after retirement may be able to eliminate state taxes on deferred compensation by pushing out payments from nonqualified plans, says Andrew Liazos, an executive compensation attorney in Boston for McDermott Will & Emery LLP.\n\nThose who have to take deferred compensation as an immediate lump sum may want to consider charitable giving through a donor-advised fund, says Scott Kaplowitch, an accountant at Edelstein & Co. in Boston, who recently helped a client set up such a vehicle with a $10 million lump-sum deferred-compensation payment. A donor-advised fund allows the donor to take an immediate tax deduction on the amount invested and decide over the course of years which charities will receive the funds. It also sets up the retiree\u2019s charitable giving for the long term, rather than having to factor annual giving amounts into retirement cash-flow projections, he says.\n\nThe fine print\n\nSome executives may find that delaying retirement into the next calendar year is beneficial, Ms. Brown of Brightworth says. It gives them another chance to make the maximum annual allowable contribution to their 401(k) plan and push out payments of vested stock and nonqualified-plan assets another year, which could be helpful if, say, the executive expects a financial windfall unrelated to work to boost his or her income.\n\nMany advisers suggest executives delay taking Social Security payments for as long as possible, setting them up to start at age 70 to avoid adding to income in a year when large deferred-compensation payments may have to be taken.\n\nAs far as company stock awards go, it pays to review your company\u2019s policies. Some plans say those who retire earlier than a set time frame forfeit any unvested awards. Some plans require employees to meet age and years-of-service hurdles before being allowed to get all their deferred compensation\u2014the standard is between 50 and 60 years old and 10 years of service. Some plans mandate an immediate lump-sum payout of vested stock for those who retire before meeting those requirements.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nCheck your plan to find out the dates that stock options have to be exercised or forfeited, says McDermott Will & Emery\u2019s Mr. Liazos.\n\nWhen people are planning to leave a job, \u201cit\u2019s never a bad idea for an employee to ask for an accounting of his or her benefits and compensation\u201d he says, so these deadlines won\u2019t be missed. \u201cIt isn\u2019t uncommon for errors to be found.

What should parents know about monitoring their children's credit records? Priya Anand discusses on Lunch Break with Tanya Rivero. Photo: iStock\n\nTo the list of things we wish we could shield children from, add identity theft.\n\nCyberthieves target children because their identities offer a clean slate with which to apply for bank accounts, credit cards or loans, government benefits and tax breaks. Criminals will often combine a child\u2019s Social Security number with a fake date of birth and address to avoid suspicion, experts say.\n\nMaking matters worse, while adults can learn quickly that their identities have been stolen, say, after being rejected for a credit card or loan, it can take years to find out that a child has been a victim of identity theft. Families often find out a child\u2019s identity was stolen when applying for college loans or scholarships, or after tax returns are filed in the child\u2019s name, says Eva Velasquez, president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a San Diego-based nonprofit that helps identity-theft victims.\n\nWhen those children become financially independent, an early and undetected identity theft can create huge barriers for them, Ms. Velasquez says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the [good and legitimate] history behind them to fall back on.\u201d\n\nSurprise at 19\n\nWhen Axton Betz-Hamilton rented an apartment at 19, a utility company required her to pay a $100 deposit because her credit score was low. She was shocked to discover she had a history of canceled credit cards and actions against her by collection agencies, even though she had opened only one credit card and taken out federal student loans in her name, she says.\n\nIllustration: Aldo Crusher\n\nTheft of her identity at age 11 had saddled her with a credit score \u201cin the second percentile of the whole nation,\u201d says Ms. Betz-Hamilton, now 34 and an assistant professor of consumer studies at Eastern Illinois University, where her research includes identity theft.\n\nThe three major credit-reporting companies, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, say they don't track figures on child-identity theft. Identity Theft Resource Center, however, says it received 298 calls related to child identity theft in 2015, or about 5.4% of the cases it heard. That was down from 6.4% in 2014, but up from 4.8% in 2013.\n\nBecause child-identity theft tends to be detected long after the fact, such numbers may vastly underestimate the scope of the problem. Credit-reporting companies add that thefts of minors\u2019 identities are hard to uncover because children can have legitimate credit records if parents add them to a credit card as an authorized user. Meanwhile, data breaches exposing children\u2019s personal information online are becoming more common.\n\nOne-in-five U.S. households has been notified by a school of a data breach that exposed the students\u2019 information, according to a survey released in October by the National Cyber Security Alliance. Breaches affecting children also can occur in the commercial realm. VTech Holdings Ltd. , a Hong Kong-based digital-learning toy maker, said in December that names, genders and birth dates of 6.5 million of its child users were exposed in a data breach. About 2.9 million were U.S. children.\n\nThe credit-reporting companies say the onus is on parents to detect thefts of their children\u2019s identities. Parents can protect their children a number of ways, starting with teaching them not to share too much information online, says Ms. Velasquez. \u201cIf your kids are allowed to have access to the Internet, it leaves them vulnerable the same way it would if you let them play in the park by themselves,\u201d she says.\n\nHere are some other ways to protect children from identity theft.\n\nLook for warning signals. Be vigilant for signs that a child\u2019s identity already may have been stolen. Well before college-loan applications or tax returns are filed, a teen may be denied a driver\u2019s license because one already exists. Other warnings may come in the form of mail sent to the children, Ms. Velasquez says, such as solicitations for loyalty programs.\n\nReact when there is a breach. If a data breach affecting a child occurs, parents should initiate free credit monitoring for the child. This will allow the parents to receive alerts if accounts are opened in the child\u2019s name, says Rod Griffin, director of public education at Experian.\n\nContact credit-reporting companies. Parents should check with the companies at least once a year to see if credit reports exist in their children\u2019s names, Mr. Griffin says. In most cases, children only have credit reports when they\u2019ve been added to a parent\u2019s credit card as an authorized user. So if parents find that there is already a report in their child\u2019s name, they should request a copy. TransUnion also has an online form where parents can submit child-identity-theft inquiries.\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nPut a credit freeze in effect. Only 23 states have laws allowing parents and legal guardians to put a security freeze on a minor\u2019s credit report, the National Conference of State Legislatures says. This blocks opening a line of credit using the child\u2019s identity. In states without such laws, Equifax will let parents and guardians initiate a report and then freeze it. But TransUnion and Experian will freeze only if there is already an existing report for the child.\n\nIf a report is frozen, the credit-reporting companies cannot release information to lenders or others who request to screen credit unless the individual lifts the lock. Assad Lazarus, senior vice president of product and consumer experience at Equifax, says a credit freeze is the most proactive solution because it blocks the possibility that a swindler could misuse the child\u2019s credit.\n\nMovement in Congress\n\nA bill has been introduced in Congress to allow parents in any state to freeze their children\u2019s credit files.\n\n\u201cWithout a frozen report, the child\u2019s Social Security number will still be clean and therefore very attractive to thieves,\u201d says U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat, and sponsor of the bill.\n\nMs. Betz-Hamilton knows how hard it can be to repair a bad credit history\u2014even a false one. She says it took her eight years to repair damage done to her credit. During that time, she says, her first credit card was canceled, and when she got a new one it had a $300 limit and 29.9% interest rate. She also was forced to pay 18.23% for a car loan, she says.\n\n\u201cI still on occasion get collection-agency letters in the mail,\u201d she adds.\n\nMs. Anand is a reporter for MarketWatch.

Photo: Vanguard\n\nJust don\u2019t call it a \u201crobo adviser.\u201d\n\nFor the past two years, the giant mutual-fund firm Vanguard Group has been testing an adviser service that combines aspects of Web-based advice and investment-modeling algorithms with traditional human contact.\n\nIt is called Vanguard Personal Advisor Services, and a company spokeswoman says it will be launched to all Vanguard clients sometime this spring. The move comes as other asset managers are sprinting into the hot, tech-driven area of the financial-planning business. Charles Schwab Corp. in March launched Intelligent Portfolios, an automated investment-advice service.\n\nRobo advisers are online services that suggest custom portfolios for investors based on math formulas. Vanguard\u2019s service\u2014combining input from both a \u201crobot\u201d and from a human in the form of a salaried Vanguard adviser\u2014is a combined approach that some other money managers are trying.\n\nHeading up the project at Vanguard is Karin Risi, 42 years old, the head of the Malvern, Pa., company\u2019s retail investor group.\n\nThe service is tiered, and tied to an investor\u2019s net worth. The more money the investor has in the service, the more personal attention he or she gets from an adviser. The fee is an annual 0.3% based on a client\u2019s investment size. Clients with portfolios larger than $5 million will pay a lower fee.\n\nMs. Risi talked about Vanguard\u2019s efforts in a recent interview at the firm. Here are edited excerpts:\n\nWSJ: How is what you\u2019re offering different from a \u201crobo adviser\u201d?\n\nMS. RISI: It\u2019s not a robo adviser, but there are similarities. I view it as more of a hybrid. We certainly have the dedicated adviser who works on a continuing basis with a client and does dedicated financial planning, but it\u2019s powered by a technology platform.\n\nWSJ: Why didn\u2019t Vanguard just go the technology route like other services?\n\nMS. RISI: I think in short we believe in the value of the [human] adviser. We\u2019ve been advising clients for nearly 20 years, so we have seen, through multiple market cycles, the value of the adviser. We still think that\u2019s really important to marry those two. The desire was to get the scale and bring a lower-cost opportunity to many more clients.\n\nWSJ: How do you think some clients will feel about having less personal contact with an adviser?\n\nMS. RISI: I think we\u2019ll see. Many of our clients will have a one-on-one experience. In many cases, they might be quite satisfied with the Web experience, with the opportunity to interact with a mobile device or through a Web video, on a tablet or a smartphone, with an adviser who has access to their accounts\u2014that might be satisfactory.\n\nWSJ: What do you think about the trend toward robo advising in general?\n\nMS. RISI: I think the trend in general is probably pretty positive in the sense that it lowers the cost of advice for many clients in whom that model resonates. I think the important thing is, what does the client need? If they really value the face-to-face and personal interaction of an adviser, than a robo doesn\u2019t hit the mark for them. Many of the robo advisers are geared specifically toward millennials. Maybe it\u2019s a model that\u2019s perfect for not only millennials but some other cadre of investors that really want a convenient and minimalist service and don\u2019t have the need for all the financial planning that is wrapped into a traditional advisory service.\n\nWSJ: What do you think of the competitiveness in the financial-advisory business?\n\nMS. RISI: It\u2019s increasing. There are traditional advisers, there are large fund companies like Vanguard that have multiple advisory offerings that range the continuum, and then there\u2019s the emerging category of all-digital advisers. I think, ultimately, that\u2019s all good for investors. It offers choice and allows different investors to gravitate toward the type of advice that\u2019s best for them.\n\nWSJ: Some services allow investments across multiple fund companies. How will yours operate?\n\nMS. RISI: Our recommendations will be Vanguard products. A lot of other companies have gone for more of an open-architecture route. We lead with a passive [index fund] preference. Our point of view from an equity perspective is largely passive.\n\nMs. Grind is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Photo: PNC\n\nIt\u2019s the earnings.\n\nA mutual fund from PNC Capital Advisors wins our quarterly Winners\u2019 Circle survey of the best actively managed stock funds.\n\nDoug Roman, fund manager of PNC Large Cap Growth Fund, turned in a 22.9% return in the 12 months ended March 31 by scrutinizing earnings revisions, on which he and his team have a \u201claserlike\u201d focus. (The fund had been the runner-up in the previous quarterly contest.)\n\n\u201cThe correlation between earnings and stock prices tends to be strong over time,\u201d he notes, and in the first quarter, tracking earnings revisions was more useful than ever in helping the team identify outperforming stocks and avoid stinkers.\n\nA case in point: Skyworks Solutions Inc., one of the largest holdings in the PNC fund\u2019s portfolio, is a semiconductor company that has launched new kinds of wireless chips. It continues to deliver earnings growth\u2014and earnings surprises, as its results for the fiscal first quarter revealed in January: The company reported its profits nearly doubled and, despite upward revisions, beat analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s quarterly contest rewards the U.S.-stock fund with at least $50 million in assets and a track record of more than three years that posted the best trailing 12-month performance. Index funds and exchange-traded funds don\u2019t qualify, because they aren\u2019t actively managed; leveraged funds also are disqualified.\n\nTaking it home\n\nMr. Roman and the PNC fund have profited from the dollar\u2019s rise. But rather than making macro bets in currencies or taking top-down bets in sectors or industries within the stock market, his focus on earnings and earnings revisions takes him to corners of the market where the dollar\u2019s strength is an advantage, or at least neutral.\n\n\u201cThere is a real domestic orientation to our portfolio now,\u201d he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t anticipate the strength in the dollar, but it emerged as the result of our bottom-up assessment of earnings. We were surprised to see how much the dollar\u2019s strength was hurting in many quarters.\u201d\n\nFor instance, PNC Large Cap Growth contains a company like Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc., most of whose sales are domestic. Noticeably absent from the list of its largest holdings is a company like Coca-Cola Co. , which already has reported that the dollar\u2019s gains are taking a bite out of profits. Supermarkets and drugstores like Kroger Co. and CVS Health Corp. are also showing an ability to deliver positive earnings surprises and upward earnings revisions, relatively sheltered from the headwinds created by the dollar, since most of their business is domestic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not arrogant enough to think we can outperform in every single environment,\u201d Mr. Roman says. \u201cBut earnings come out four times a year, and we\u2019re playing the odds that in a normal environment, investors react to them.\u201d\n\nAn honorable mention\n\nMeanwhile, this quarter\u2019s contest had a fund that did even slightly better than the PNC one, but through the peculiar circumstance of betting on currencies. So while it is notable, the performance didn\u2019t qualify as an active stock fund for this round of the contest.\n\nJim Smigiel. Photo: SEI\n\nThe fund is SEI Dynamic Asset Allocation Fund, and in the 12-month period its bet against the euro and on the dollar was the big driver of a 23.8% gain.\n\n\u201cWe knew that the European Central Bank would have to act; that the economy was in worse and worse shape,\u201d says Jim Smigiel, the fund\u2019s portfolio manager and managing director of SEI\u2019s portfolio strategies group. When the ECB moved to cut rates, that sent the euro down against the dollar, especially since the Federal Reserve has signaled its intent to raise rates later this year.\n\nMr. Smigiel and his team earned their return not from the stocks in the stock component of the fund\u2019s portfolio\u2014which is managed as if it were an index fund\u2014but from active bets in the currency markets, including options contracts. Technically, a part of the fund is actively managed; also technically, it is invested in stocks\u2014but the two didn\u2019t come together. Still, the fund gets our honorable mention this quarter for identifying the right trend\u2014and for its complex tactical asset-allocation dance.\n\nMs. McGee is a writer in New England.

Strong year-to-date gains for U.S.-stock mutual funds, powered by record highs in the stock market, withered as the first quarter ended.\n\nAnd now, international-stock funds are finally justifying their popularity. The funds, which had a negative performance in 2014 even as their U.S. counterparts gained, are reversing the trend in 2015\u2014finally, a payoff for the cash that investors have been plowing in.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. markets have been such an incredibly strong place to be\u201d since the financial crisis, says Katie Koch, a managing director at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. While still positive about U.S. economic growth, \u201cwe\u2019re probably less bullish on U.S. equities than we have been for several years.\u201d\n\nWith U.S. markets having given up the momentum of low interest rates, \u201cvaluations continue to be more attractive in Europe,\u201d Ms. Koch says.\n\nThe average diversified U.S.-stock mutual fund had a 2.5% return in the quarter, with no help from March, which came in at negative 0.3%, according to data from Thomson Reuters Corp. \u2019s Lipper unit\u2014a reality check after the 7.6% gain in 2014. International funds, in contrast, rose 4.5% in the quarter, after a 5% drop in 2014.\n\nKatie Koch of Goldman Sachs: less bullish on the U.S. Photo: Goldman Sachs Asset Management\n\nInvestors poured cash into international funds as well as bond funds in the quarter, and spurned U.S.-stock funds, continuing the fund-flows trend from 2014. Investors put a net $26.53 billion into international funds, according to estimates from the Investment Company Institute. U.S.-stock funds lost a bit more money than they took in, registering $40 million of outflows.\n\nFor fund investors, this could mean it is a good time to take on some international exposure in a portfolio if it isn\u2019t there already. But as Ms. Koch notes, there is some currency risk that could derail international gains, unless an investor has hedged against it. (Indeed, our Fund Fiend columnist, Tom Lauricella, writes about the impact that currency moves like the weak euro can have on international funds).\n\nBond funds rose. Many investors are seeking safety, and Federal Reserve rate increases don\u2019t yet appear imminent. The most widely held variety, funds that focus on intermediate-term investment-grade debt, had an average return of 1.7% for the quarter, including a 0.4% gain for March. Bond funds had risen 5.3% in 2014.\n\nInflows to bond funds ballooned to $36.75 billion in the quarter, according to the ICI\u2019s estimates, adding to last year\u2019s buying.

Let other rockers rip up hotel rooms and burn through money. This four-person band tours the country teaching middle- and high-school students about saving money and the power of compounding. Last year, the band played 26 shows, reaching 13,000 students in locations such as Wichita, Kan., and Dallas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of a Trojan horse,\u201d says the band\u2019s frontman, Gooding (he uses simply his last name for himself and the band).\n\nThe band has joined with a Cheyenne, Wyo., nonprofit, Funding the Future, which finds the band sponsors for its tours. Currently, for instance, the financial-services firm Raymond James Financial Inc. is a sponsor for the band\u2019s Financial Literacy Tour.\n\nRita Pouppirt, Funding the Future\u2019s executive director, says students need role models to inspire them about budgeting and the dangers of payday loans. And they might not want to learn about money from someone wearing a suit.\n\nEnter Gooding.\n\nDressed in black leather jackets and ripped jeans, the band typically leads an assembly at the end of a school day.\n\nOn the band\u2019s Financial Literacy Tour, frontman Gooding (arms raised) in Denver. Photo: Patina Grayson\n\nStudents are told they\u2019ll be learning about financial literacy. \u201cUgh\u201d might be the collective reaction. But they are often surprised by the concert atmosphere in the school auditorium\u2014complete with big speakers and lighting.\n\nLoud music, quiet advice\n\nFirst, there is a short video about the band, pictured with celebrities.\n\nThen the band launches into a 20-minute concert of original songs. \u201cWe play as loud as they let us,\u201d Mr. Gooding says. It culminates with Mr. Gooding playing two guitars. By then, students are usually on their feet.\n\nAfter a short break, Mr. Gooding comes back, usually to the screams of the students. \u201cThey\u2019re all ears at that point,\u201d he says.\n\nBut instead of singing, Mr. Gooding begins his 15-minute financial-literacy presentation. The music, he says, \u201cmakes the medicine go down.\u201d\n\nThe Band\u2019s Site See Gooding\u2019s website here\n\nWhile the presentation is brief, it might be the first time a student hears about some of the personal-finance concepts. Mr. Gooding shows students images of entertainers and athletes who made millions but went bankrupt.\n\nFor some students, this starts to debunk the myth that money will solve all problems, he says. Mr. Gooding explains that unless they are stewards of their money\u2014say, by socking away a portion of their earnings\u2014they won\u2019t get ahead no matter how much they make.\n\nHe explains the importance of living below your means, starting a savings account and saving for an emergency. He talks about how he borrowed too much on his credit card when he was younger because he didn\u2019t have enough saved to fix his broken-down car.\n\nHe projects a chart on how compounding works. His analogy: \u201cEvery dollar is a soldier. If you respect money and you leave the soldiers in the field, they will go out and fight for you.\u201d\n\nAfter the presentation, the band will answer questions from individual students\u2014sometimes staying as long as three hours after the assembly ends.\n\nRocking a Roth\n\nMr. Gooding says the caliber of the questions often surprises him. For example, he recently had a high-school student ask him about starting a Roth IRA.\n\nAfter the band is gone, teachers are given a financial-literacy curriculum to help build on the lessons.\n\nSome of the band\u2019s fan mail is from students who say they opened savings accounts and have shared what they\u2019ve learned with family and friends.\n\nIf the presentations are having such an impact, Mr. Gooding gives much of the credit to the band\u2019s music. \u201cI\u2019d hate to hear what the kids would say if we didn\u2019t play first,\u201d he says.\n\nMs. Dagher is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Much of the time, in fact. That is as true in investing as it is in baseball.\n\nLast year, 79% of actively managed U.S.-stock mutual funds failed to top their benchmarks, according to research firm Morningstar Inc., the worst year for relative performance in modern history. At the same time, more individuals gave up trying to beat the market at all, as investors pulled nearly $99 billion from actively managed U.S.-stock funds last year and moved $71 billion into index funds.\n\nCan\u2019t anybody play this game?\n\nWe figured it was a good time to ask four acclaimed investors with records of top performance what they learned about markets and investing from some of their hits and\u2014maybe more so\u2014from their misses.\n\nRob Arnott: Learned to stick to his expertise. Photo: Tim Boyle/Bloomberg News\n\nRob Arnott\n\nFounder and chairman of Research Affiliates, known for a quantitative investment strategy that has beaten the market over the long term.\n\nHIT: In February 2000, after trailing the market for more than a year as investors bid up tech stocks, Rob Arnott\u2019s research team at First Quadrant LP tweaked its investment model to reduce the emphasis on \u201cvalue\u201d stocks\u2014those trading at a low price relative to their earnings\u2014and increase exposure to surging tech shares.\n\nAbout a month later, when he found out about the move, Mr. Arnott ordered the model returned to its original stance, sticking with the firm\u2019s value orientation.\n\nIt was in the nick of time. Tech shares soon cratered, value held up well, and the firm scored impressive returns and gained clients.\n\nTHE LESSON: \u201cWhen your strategy goes against you, the natural inclination is to try to figure out what\u2019s wrong with your strategy, but that\u2019s dangerous,\u201d says Mr. Arnott, whose current firm, Research Affiliates, has been buying out-of-favor emerging-markets shares lately. \u201cDon\u2019t fight the most recent battle, over and over again.\u201d\n\nMISS: Mr. Arnott was convinced opportunity was afoot. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell almost 7% on Oct. 13, 1989, after a leveraged buyout of airline company UAL Corp. collapsed.\n\nMr. Arnott was sure the \u201cminicrash\u201d was unwarranted, and he headed to First Quadrant\u2019s trading floor, positioning himself next to his traders as they prepared to follow the firm\u2019s models and scoop up shares. \u201cI wanted to make sure we took advantage,\u201d Mr. Arnott recalls. \u201cSo I hovered around.\u201d\n\nBig mistake. Mr. Arnott was an unusual presence on the floor. \u201cI got them so nervous that they were waiting for my instructions,\u201d he says. He never gave them any, waiting instead for the perfect entry point.\n\nIt never came, and the market began to recover before the firm\u2019s buying began in earnest. Opportunity was lost.\n\nTHE LESSON: \u201cDon\u2019t get involved if you don\u2019t have expertise,\u201d Mr. Arnott says. \u201cMy expertise is taking advantage of bargains, shunning what\u2019s expensive, not short-term trading.\u201d\n\nJeremy Grantham: Learned to avoid speculation. Photo: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News\n\nJeremy Grantham\n\nChief investment strategist at GMO LLC in Boston, known for warnings about both the late-1990s tech-stock bubble and 2008\u2019s credit bubble.\n\nHIT: When Jeremy Grantham\u2019s firm took a cautious stance on popular but expensive tech stocks in 1999, performance suffered and clients bolted. He and his team stuck to their guns and were rewarded when tech shares crashed and the firm rebounded sharply in the early 2000s.\n\nToo many investing pros are afraid of immediate-term \u201ccareer risk,\u201d Mr. Grantham says, so they chase hot investment trends instead of aiming for superior long-term returns in cheap, unloved corners of the market.\n\nGMO, the firm Mr. Grantham co-founded, was one of the first to emphasize an asset-class allocation strategy, which many rivals shied away from, likely because large multiasset bets carry more career risk. The market is more likely to misprice asset classes than individual securities, however, so they \u201coffer more opportunity,\u201d he says.\n\nTHE LESSON: \u201cThere are inefficiencies in moving global assets around, not unlike stocks decades ago,\u201d he says. \u201cThe bigger the range of assets you can invest in, the less competition you will have and the better the opportunities.\u201d\n\nMISS: Mr. Grantham became interested in stocks at 16 when a family friend shared an upbeat outlook for his company. Mr. Grantham quickly bought up shares. Within about a year, the company was in an accounting scandal and the shares were worthless.\n\nHe didn\u2019t learn. Fourteen years later, Mr. Grantham heard a pitch for American Raceways, a company that was going to introduce Formula One racing in the U.S. \u201cI got hooked,\u201d he says. \u201cWe thought we would make money beyond our dreams.\u201d\n\nMr. Grantham bought 300 shares for himself at $7 and went on vacation to Germany with his wife. When they came home three weeks later, the stock was at $21. He sold everything else he had, borrowed more money and soon owned 900 shares. Months later, American Raceways hit $100. \u201cI figured I had the golden touch.\u201d Were millions of dollars to come?\n\nBut the stock began tumbling. It dropped more each day, torturing Mr. Grantham. Americans weren\u2019t ready to embrace Formula One racing after all.\n\nThe stock went down so fast that Mr. Grantham worried he wouldn\u2019t be able to pay back his lenders. He managed to exit the position with just enough money to pay his debt.\n\nTHE LESSON: \u201cI realized investing wasn\u2019t a game,\u201d says Mr. Grantham. \u201cI swore off speculation for life. I became a cautious, value investor.\u201d (Meanwhile, as the couple\u2019s net worth soared and then plunged, Mr. Grantham\u2019s wife refrained from pointing the finger at him\u2014another \u201cpowerful lesson,\u201d this time in the importance of marrying the right person, he says.)\n\nHoward Marks: Learned that quality isn\u2019t a guarantee. Photo: Brent Lewin/Bloomberg News\n\nHoward Marks\n\nCo-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, a debt-focused firm with strong returns, known for a contrarian investment philosophy.\n\nHIT: In 2004, Howard Marks and Oaktree\u2019s co-founder, Bruce Karsh, saw a bubble developing in riskier debt markets. They pared holdings, suffering as debt prices raced higher.\n\nBut when subprime mortgages pulled the financial system down, beginning in 2007, the moves looked savvy.\n\nTHE LESSON: \u201cThe most important single decision an investor has to make is whether to be on offense or defense.\u201d Turning conservative too early is part of the price that investors sometimes need to pay.\n\nMISS: As a young analyst at Citibank in 1968, Mr. Marks was part of an investment team buying \u201cNifty Fifty\u201d fast-growing stocks. They got burned, and he has never forgotten.\n\nYes, many of the companies had high-quality managements and global reach. A few, including International Business Machines Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Merck & Co. and Coca-Cola Co., would endure for decades.\n\nDespite that, these stocks slid\u2014some as much as 90%\u2014when a bear market hit in the early 1970s. Mr. Marks\u2019s bosses lost their jobs, and he realized that paying too much even for a strong business can cripple returns.\n\nTHE LESSON: \u201cI learned buying high-quality assets doesn\u2019t equate to successful investments or safety,\u201d Mr. Marks says.\n\nJeffrey Gundlach: Learned to leave a comfort zone. Photo: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg News\n\nJeffrey Gundlach\n\nCEO of DoubleLine Capital LP, known for prescient market calls. In June 2007 he warned that the subprime-mortgage market was \u201ca total unmitigated disaster and it\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d\n\nHIT: It was March 2008, and Jeffrey Gundlach was testing his nerve in a crisis.\n\nEven assuming a rash of defaults and other bad news, debt investments priced at 65 cents on the dollar looked attractive. He began buying, though he knew there was a good chance markets would continue to drop.\n\n\u201cIf fundamental value is compelling, you should keep buying,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to take short-term losses.\u201d\n\nMr. Gundlach was right\u2014prices continued to fall for another full year, eventually hitting 45 cents on the dollar. One big client got nervous and withdrew money from his fund. Mr. Gundlach ran out of money and couldn\u2019t buy more, locking in his cost basis.\n\nBeginning in the spring of 2009, the market launched a furious comeback. Mr. Gundlach\u2019s firm eventually made about $20 billion from the bargain hunting.\n\nTHE LESSON: If a stock or bond has fallen, it often means expectations are low, as investors focus on troubles, not possible solutions, Mr. Gundlach says. \u201cIdentifiable problems aren\u2019t a reason to stay away from an investment, they\u2019re a reason to look,\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole trick to investing is identifying when problems are already discounted in prices.\u201d\n\nMISS: From 2000 to 2002, junk bonds tumbled amid accounting scandals at Enron Corp., WorldCom and others.\n\nMr. Gundlach, at the time a fund manager at TCW Group, ran a fund focused on mortgages, as well as several other broader fixed-income funds. He crunched the numbers and realized a range of investments were suddenly cheap, even in a worst-case scenario. He itched to buy across various asset classes.\n\n\u201cClients were terrified, reinforcing my [bullish] view,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Gundlach bought junk bonds in his broader funds but stuck with mortgages in his big mortgage fund, even though he had the ability to buy other kinds of investments, including junk bonds.\n\nWhen the junk-bond market launched a powerful comeback he kicked himself for not doing more. \u201cI didn\u2019t think more broadly about diversifying my strategy,\u201d Mr. Gundlach says.\n\nTHE LESSON: Most investors miss huge opportunities outside their comfort zones. \u201cI had a very narrow way of thinking about investing.\u2026 I vowed not to do that again,\u201d Mr. Gundlach says. \u201cMost Americans tremble about buying outside the U.S.,\u201d for example, so they squander opportunities.\n\nMr. Zuckerman is a special writer for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

When people make out their wills, they typically name a trusted person as their executor, who then has a legal responsibility to distribute their property according to the wishes of the deceased, and make sure all debts and creditors are paid.\n\nBut in addition to lots of paperwork and deadlines, the job often comes with a minefield of family issues. And worst of all, executors can be sued.\n\nHere are some of the biggest mistakes executors want to avoid:\n\nPaying bills too quickly\n\nOften an executor will start receiving the deceased\u2019s mail and paying credit-card bills and other invoices as they arrive, says Debra Doyle, shareholder at the law firm Greenberg Traurig in Chicago. They do this, Ms. Doyle says, in the mistaken belief that timely payment is required.\n\nIn truth, such bills are well down the list of priorities for payment. Paying these debts before all other classes is a breach of fiduciary duty and potentially exposes the executor to personal liability, Ms. Doyle says.\n\nMs. Doyle recalls one estate that carried a significant federal income-tax liability the executor knew nothing about. Once the tax bill became known, there wasn\u2019t enough money left in the estate to pay it since the executor had first paid other debts.\n\nIn cases like this, the executor potentially has a personal liability to pay the outstanding tax liability because the executor improperly paid estate assets to satisfy lower-class creditor claims before settling the IRS claims, Ms. Doyle says. In some cases, the IRS may be willing to settle with the executor, but not in all cases, she adds.\n\nBefore paying any creditors, executors should consult with a trust and estate attorney to understand the priority of payments. For example, funeral expenses and federal and state taxes take priority over other debts such as the cable bill, she says.\n\nIn addition, the executor should consult with the estate\u2019s accountant for an estimate of all tax liabilities, and consult with the estate\u2019s attorney to estimate all administration expenses and payments, if any, due to the surviving spouse or children under a spousal or child\u2019s award from the probate court.\n\nEven after setting aside sufficient estate assets to satisfy the highest priority creditors, executors should consider satisfying all other debts and creditors only after the entire estate administration has been completed and all tax returns filed and taxes paid. This process may take nine months to two years, depending on the complexities involved, Ms. Doyle says.\n\nPlaying the market\n\nSome executors are tempted to invest an estate\u2019s assets\u2014in an attempt to increase the value of the estate\u2014during the settlement process. That can be a risky tactic. For one, an executor generally has no obligation to increase the value of an estate\u2019s holdings, even if the distribution to heirs is prolonged.\n\nIt\u2019s especially risky when an estate plan calls for giving a trust or individual a \u201cpecuniary\u201d amount, which is a precise amount based upon the value of assets reported on the estate tax return, says Hugh Magill, Northern Trust \u2019s chief fiduciary officer. That specific amount must be distributed to the trust or individual, regardless of fluctuations in the value of the assets before funding.\n\nOne father named his three adult sons as executors under his estate plan, which included a pecuniary formula for funding the trust for the surviving spouse, with the balance of the estate passing to the sons. The estate consisted largely of high-quality bonds, which the sons sold shortly after their father\u2019s death to invest in a much riskier portfolio of small-cap stocks, which they hoped would grow, Mr. Magill says. But the value of those stocks declined more than 50% before the spouse\u2019s trust was funded at the full amount required. The sons\u2019 resulting share bore the entire decline in the stocks\u2019 value, resulting in a loss to them of more than $5 million.\n\nIf the decline in the stock portfolio had been so large that the spouse\u2019s trust could not be fully funded, the sons\u2019 actions could have subjected them to a lawsuit for breach of fiduciary duty, he says.\n\nDon\u2019t \u201cplay the market\u201d during the estate-settlement process, Mr. Magill says. In most states, the executor has an obligation to conserve, but not to increase, the value of the assets during estate settlement.\n\nMishandling real estate\n\nReal estate is often one of the hardest assets to administer, says Ms. Doyle. One beneficiary might be living in the house, while another might want it sold quickly. The executor must decide the listing price and the commission to pay the real-estate agent, Ms. Doyle says. Unless amicable decisions can be reached among all of the beneficiaries, the executor may be forced to seek probate-court assistance, she says.\n\nIn addition, real-estate agents may recommend certain improvements to the property before the sale. Before authorizing any improvement, the executor needs to consider whether he or she is authorized to spend estate assets to make such improvements.\n\nExecutors also should be careful not to hold on to a house for too long. Insurance companies don\u2019t like to insure empty houses for extended periods, Ms. Doyle says. If the home is vacant, the executor also needs to beware of maintenance issues. If a pipe breaks, significant damage can be done before anyone discovers it. Repairs can cost thousands of dollars and delay a property\u2019s sale.\n\nExecutors should maintain the homeowner\u2019s insurance on the decedent\u2019s house in case of a fire or accident, says Avi Kestenbaum, partner at the Meltzer, Lippe, Goldstein & Breitstone law firm in Mineola, N.Y.\n\nLosing tangible assets\n\nExecutors sometimes don\u2019t realize that assets\u2014tangible and intangible\u2014belong to a new entity, the estate, as of the date of death. It\u2019s the executor\u2019s responsibility to keep the assets safe while arrangements are made to distribute them according to the decedent\u2019s plan, says Paulina Mejia, managing director and head of wealth strategies at Atlantic Trust in New York.\n\nMs. Mejia says she knew an executor who was a family friend of the deceased and didn\u2019t realize the son was helping himself to his late father\u2019s works of art and valuable items while the estate was being settled. This caused many problems, because the will bequeathed the art to a museum. The executor could have been sued, she adds. The executor should have immediately taken an inventory of the assets and arranged to appraise and securely store the art until it was ready to be distributed to the museum, Ms. Mejia says.\n\nExecutors must find all of the deceased\u2019s assets and sort through all of their personal belongings to account for the entire estate, says Victor Ngai, an executive at Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America in New York. They also may need to get security for the home.\n\nOne other word of advice from Mr. Ngai: Don\u2019t succumb to family pressure to make distributions too soon. It may result in insufficient assets to pay off creditors, he says.\n\n\u201cMoney has a habit of changing the attitudes of a lot of people,\u201d Mr. Ngai says, \u201cbut an executor\u2019s job isn\u2019t simply to distribute wealth.\u201d\n\nMs. Dagher is a Wall Street Journal reporter and host of the Watching Your Wealth podcast.

They should set budgets. Cut back expenses to better match incomes. And monitor their purchases to keep themselves on the straight and narrow.\n\nYet all too often when people try to take those steps, they fail. Before they know it, the bills pile up and they end up right back where they started.\n\nResearchers are beginning to discover why you can break your budget despite getting all the basics right. WSJ\u2019s Charlie Wells joins Tanya Rivero to discuss. Photo: Getty\n\nWhy? What drives us to spend too much even when we seem to make all the right moves?\n\nResearchers are just beginning to understand\u2014and the answers seem to lie in psychological impulses and blind spots that are tough for people to recognize, let alone overcome, in their day-to-day lives.\n\nPeople\u2019s mental wiring, for instance, is great at forecasting future income but terrible at imagining future expenses, leading us to set unrealistic budgets. How we think about our emotional resources also matters: If people imagine willpower as something that\u2019s limited, they feel the need to reward themselves with things like impulse purchases when they accomplish a goal. And sometimes people unconsciously place such a high value on seeming financially responsible that they end up making choices that cost more money\u2014like making big purchases on credit instead of tapping savings.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what science is uncovering about our hidden impulses to spend and save, and how we can correct some of our worst mistakes.\n\nGive future expenses enough weight\n\nOne plank of a successful financial plan is an estimate of future income and expenses. The general goal, of course, is to spend no more than you bring in. But too often, the mind gets in the way.\n\nThe problem: For reasons researchers are still trying to understand, people are terrible at estimating outflows. According to a 2008 study in the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, humans use overly simplistic reasoning patterns that focus too much on inflows to estimate everything from how much water might be in a tub to the volume of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\nAnd that has big implications for how they make financial plans, says John Lynch, director of the Center for Research on Consumer Financial Decision Making at the University of Colorado, Boulder, whose team researched the phenomenon in a forthcoming study in the Journal of Marketing Research.\n\nWhen planning future finances, his study found, people think about income (inflows) but don\u2019t really focus on rising expenses (outflows) so they end up thinking they can afford things they can\u2019t. \u201cThis is how people end up buying a house or a car that they ultimately can\u2019t afford,\u201d says Mr. Lynch. \u201cThey estimate how much their incomes will rise and they know theoretically that they will have more expenses, things like insurance, the mortgage payments, gas, the repair costs. But they still ignore those costs when making the decision.\u201d\n\nMr. Lynch uses the hypothetical example of a professional with an income of $48,000. She lives in a smaller city where a one-bedroom apartment costs $1,150 a month and dinner out for two costs $54. The professional is given the opportunity to earn $68,000 at a job in New York City. She realizes that it is more expensive to live in New York than the smaller city\u2014an apartment will run $3,000 and dinners out $80. In spite of this, she feels that she is substantially better off financially in the new job, because she weighs her perception of her increased income far more substantially than her perception of her increased expenses.\n\nMr. Lynch and his team are looking into behavioral solutions for this dilemma, but he believes a crucial component is to create an explicit budget. When people rely on subjective impressions of their finances and it looks possible that they can fit everything in, they spend. When they keep an explicit budget, it is much more likely that they will decide to cut out some desirable but unaffordable expense.\n\nKnow the true cost of feeling sound\n\nFor many people, a financial plan involves focusing on one goal: keeping\u2014and building\u2014a certain amount of savings. It\u2019s a worthwhile aim. But some recent studies suggest that it can backfire and lead people to spend more than they otherwise would.\n\nAbigail Sussman, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, had a theory: Saving money makes people feel financially responsible. But that desire to feel responsible could be so strong that it might lead people to borrow money at expensive interest rates, to keep savings high and feel good about themselves.\n\nTo test her idea, Ms. Sussman and a co-author conducted online surveys. In one, she recruited 185 people to answer questions about how they would pay for a $1,000 emergency expense. They were asked whether they would spend money from savings or use a credit card at 10 different interest rates, from 0% to 30%.\n\nIn a forthcoming study in the Journal of Marketing Research, Ms. Sussman found that even though people were theoretically earning 1% interest from their savings, they were willing to borrow money at much higher rates to keep their savings at a certain level.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not at all saying people shouldn\u2019t save,\u201d says Ms. Sussman. \u201cBut even people with an appropriate liquidity cushion want to keep more money in their savings accounts because it makes them feel responsible, even though it might lead them to do these behaviors that are potentially economically costly.\u201d\n\nMs. Sussman says consumers should focus on the big picture and not view every decision through the single lens of preserving their savings. For instance, people who have a solid cash safety net should come up with a financial plan that includes spending extra savings to avoid debt. The plan should include provisions that still make the person feel financially responsible, even if they spend savings, such as replenishing those savings at each pay period. As simple as that seems, she says, it\u2019s surprising how many people don\u2019t follow it.\n\n\u201cThe lesson here is to be a little bit thoughtful about your spending, where the money is coming from and the costs associated with that, rather than taking a rule given to you and using it for everything,\u201d she says.\n\nStop spending to reward yourself\n\nMany people go awry in their spending because of the way they view willpower\u2014and what they feel they deserve for using it.\n\nStudies have found that some people imagine willpower as something that is a limited resource and is fairly easily depleted, while others see it as something abundant that doesn\u2019t run out. That leads to very different behavior in times of stress. People who think willpower is limited think they deserve to reward themselves for showing some willpower, while people who think it\u2019s unlimited think no reward is needed or deserved.\n\nFor people in the former category\u2014those who think willpower is limited\u2014the rewards they give themselves are often unhealthy, like eating junk food, procrastination and overspending. That\u2019s according to a 2015 study by a team of Stanford University and University of Zurich researchers published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.\n\nThe study surveyed 176 undergraduates at Stanford University and divided them into two groups: those who thought willpower was finite and those who thought it was abundant. During stressful periods, people who believed willpower was finite reported more impulsive behaviors, including overspending.\n\nChanging how a person thinks about the availability of willpower would probably require a long-term intervention, says Veronika Job of the University of Zurich, a co-author of the study. In the short term, she recommends that people with these habits find ways to rest or reward themselves after hard work that don\u2019t include spending or other unproductive behaviors\u2014such as engaging in sports, going out into nature or meditating, she says.\n\nFurther, she suggests that people who tend to want to reward themselves after stress should try to avoid putting themselves in situations where they could be tempted to lose control. \u201cIf you know you\u2019ve had a bad day and you\u2019re prone to go shopping to reward yourself, you might want to avoid heading in the direction of the stores on that day,\u201d she says.\n\nMind your mood when spending\n\nOther research has begun to explore the tangled relationship between moods and money habits. When people are sad, their habits are worse. When they are happy, their habits are better. Even if money can\u2019t buy happiness, it seems that happiness can buy money.\n\nAccording to a 2012 study of 4,500 Dutch consumers in the Journal of Economic Psychology, unhappy people save less, spend more and have a higher propensity to consume. They have less control over their expenses and envision higher inflation in the future.\n\nHappy people exhibit the opposite characteristics. They are more future-oriented and pursue goals that will serve them better in the long run. They believe there will be less inflation over time, and so save more money to benefit from cheaper prices in the long run and spend less in the immediate term.\n\n\u201cEspecially while making decisions about consumption and savings, this study tells us that our psychological conditions really matter in terms of making good or bad choices,\u201d says Cahit Guven, a senior lecturer in economics at Deakin University in Australia who conducted the research.\n\nMr. Guven suggests that people wait until they are in better moods to make financial decisions. It might seem hard to know if you have the perspective to make the right decision, but Mr. Guven says that in study after study, individuals have shown that they are actually good judges of their personal states when asked to report their well being.\n\nHe also recommends that people give their financial plans another look if they seem to be focused too much on the short term and get perspective by involving more than one person in household financial planning.\n\nDon\u2019t let your home equity tempt you\n\nFinally, people display a blind spot when it comes to their homes. Many people spend more when the value of their assets\u2014particularly their property\u2014goes up, even though in reality those assets often won\u2019t add to their spending power in the future. In fact, for each $1 increase in the market value of a home, certain households increased their consumption by six cents to 18 cents, according to a 2013 study in the Review of Economics and Statistics.\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThere are several possible explanations. First, as researchers have long noted, the more a house is worth, the more people feel they have extra money to spend. Second, the more a house is worth, the more a homeowner can borrow against it.\n\nDaniel Cooper, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston who wrote the 2013 study, measured the relationship between consumption and housing wealth, focusing on how fluctuations in housing wealth impact households\u2019 borrowing power. He found the spending increase occurred when higher housing prices allowed people who needed more credit to borrow more against the value of their homes.\n\n\u201cPeople get really excited when their house prices go up. They feel wealthier, like they have all this extra money,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you have to step back and say, \u2018Is this really the case?\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Cooper explains that to realize actual wealth from an increase in a home\u2019s value, a person would have to sell the house. A comparable house in the same market would likely cost just as much. So a person wouldn\u2019t have that much extra cash available to spend, unless he or she downsized significantly.\n\nIn general, Mr. Cooper says that people need to think about their homes not as an investment, not even as a regular financial asset, but as a place to live. What\u2019s more, people shouldn\u2019t think about a home as a tool for borrowing more money. \u201cIf you max out your home-equity line of credit and then housing prices change, chances are you will find yourself financially constrained,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Wells is a news editor for The Wall Street Journal in London.

New research suggests you probably wouldn\u2019t.\n\nShowing people how their retirement finances stack up against those of peers doesn\u2019t motivate them to save more and, in some cases, can actually backfire\u2014that is, discourage people from participating in a 401(k) altogether\u2014according to a paper I recently published in the Journal of Finance in collaboration with researchers from Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School.\n\nSuch results are surprising, considering peer-comparison strategies are being used successfully in other domains to get people to change their behavior. The findings also raise questions about whether financial companies are on the right track in creating tools that allow customers to see how much others are saving. Part of a movement known as social-norms marketing, the tools are based on the idea that much of human behavior is influenced by what people consider to be \u201cnormal,\u201d so if you can correct misperceptions about what normal behavior is, you can motivate the underperformers to move closer to the norm.\n\nThe strategy seems to work in certain situations. Some utilities, for example, have managed to persuade customers to conserve electricity by showing them how their energy use compares with that of neighbors.\n\nWhy then, might social-norms strategies fall flat when it comes to retirement savings? It could be that learning that your peers are ahead of you financially is much more demoralizing than, say, learning that you use more energy than your neighbors. And when people are demoralized, they tend to disengage from a problem rather than address it.\n\nA surprise\n\nTo study the issue, my co-authors ( John Beshears, David Laibson, and Brigitte Madrian of Harvard, and Katy Milkman of Wharton) and I teamed up with a company that wanted to encourage its employees to save more for retirement. The company sent about 1,400 workers who weren\u2019t participating in its 401(k) plan a simplified enrollment form that let them start contributing 6% of their pay to the 401(k) just by checking a box, signing, and mailing the form back.\n\nThe key twist was that different workers received different versions of the form. Some were randomly chosen to get a form that revealed the fraction of co-workers in their age group who already were contributing to the 401(k). Others got a form without this information. We then compared the behavior of those who received peer information to those who didn\u2019t.\n\nWe went into the study thinking that peer information would increase savings, but we found no robust evidence that it did. And for the subset of nonsavers that we thought would be most susceptible to peer influence\u2014those who weren\u2019t subject to 401(k) automatic enrollment\u2014peer information actually discouraged them from joining the plan. Most of the people in this group weren\u2019t opposed to saving; rather, they simply hadn\u2019t gotten around to joining the plan. Yet peer information reduced subsequent enrollment rates in this group by a third\u2014from 9.9% to 6.3%.\n\nA vulnerable group\n\nSo why didn\u2019t peer pressure work? We considered whether the problem was that the peer information moved beliefs in the wrong direction. That is, maybe employees learned that fewer of their co-workers were saving than they thought, so not saving felt more in line with the norm.\n\nBut if employees were surprised at how few of their co-workers were saving, peer information should have had a more positive effect among those who saw that a higher fraction of their co-workers were saving. It didn\u2019t. In fact, the higher the peer group\u2019s savings, the more peer information reduced enrollment.\n\nIn the end, we concluded that peer information most likely reduced savings because it left the laggards feeling too discouraged. Imagine finding out that not only are you way behind on your financial goals, but nearly everybody around you is way ahead of you. It\u2019s easy to see how you might want to avoid thinking about the problem altogether.\n\nIn our study, the negative effects of peer information were concentrated among those with low salaries, which is consistent with previous studies showing that negative information typically has a stronger effect on low-status individuals. Researchers have theorized this is because low-status individuals have higher background levels of stress, which makes them more vulnerable to depression in response to setbacks, defeats and humiliations.\n\nIn sum, while it may be helpful to learn what your peers are doing in areas not so intimately tied up with self-worth and identity, when it comes to saving for retirement, it might be best to avoid comparisons with others.\n\nDr. Choi is a professor of finance at Yale School of Management.

The policies promise annual interest based on formulas pegged to stock indexes.\n\nBut a fight had broken out between life insurers that promote the policies and others that consider the policies too risky for people who need life insurance. After lengthy debate, state insurance regulators last month adopted a new guideline for marketing material used by insurers and agents. A key feature now is a limit on the annual investment gain that can be used to illustrate a policy\u2019s potential performance.\n\nSales of indexed policies grew 23% last year by a key measure of premiums, the strongest growth of any type of individual life insurance, according to Limra, a research trade association for the financial-services industry. Premiums from indexed universal life now represent one-fifth of all new individual life-insurance sales. In contrast, overall sales of individual life insurance\u2014including combination savings-and-death-benefit policies with interest linked to insurers\u2019 bond-heavy investment portfolios\u2014grew just 2% in 2014.\n\nWith the indexed universal-life policies, insurers pay interest into the policyholder\u2019s tax-deferred account with formulas tied to the performance of stock indexes, often the S&P 500, up to a specified cap. At the same time, the policies come with protection from market losses.\n\nCurrently, many insurers use annual interest of 8% to 10% a year in the \u201cillustrations\u201d that agents give consumers to show how the indexed product works, according to industry executives and financial advisers. The policies have multiple moving parts: The buyer pays an annual premium into the policy, the insurer deducts money for expenses including the annual cost of the death benefit, and the remainder of the premium stays in the policy earning interest.\n\nUnder the guideline adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, an insurer with a typical version of an S&P-500-linked product would be limited to about 7% in projected annual interest, officials and executives said. The association\u2019s guidelines are used by most states across the U.S.\n\n\u2018Reputational risk\u2019\n\n\u201cWe applaud the NAIC for taking up the issue of current abusive marketing practices,\u201d says Lawrence Rybka, president of Valmark Securities, a securities and insurance brokerage based in Akron, Ohio. If not addressed, consumers stood to be harmed and the industry faced \u201creputational risk as a whole.\u201d\n\nAs stocks rallied in recent years, indexed universal life gained popularity\u2014and drew public criticism from some leading insurance companies that don\u2019t sell the policies. Critics have included MetLife Inc. and New York Life Insurance Co.\n\nLackluster gains could have major effects on consumers, because universal-life policies of all sorts (not just the indexed ones) typically are sold on the assumption that accumulated interest will pay for some or all of the future annual cost of keeping a policy in force.\n\nSo, if interest income falls short, policyholders could be forced to find other money to cover the annual expense\u2014or possibly even lose the policy. Under many policies, the annual insurance charges can rise sharply as the policyholder ages, reflecting the person\u2019s rising odds of death.\n\nIndexed policies have gained traction in part because low interest rates can make conventional bond-based policies a tougher sale given the relatively slow interest buildup.\n\n\u2018Right balance\u2019\n\nThe regulators\u2019 swift action in the matter is a signal of the dangers of too-optimistic illustrations. \u201cAs an industry, what\u2019s most important is that we not lead consumers to disappointment,\u201d says Randolph Clerihue, a MetLife spokesman. \u201cThe new rules strike the right balance between providing companies flexibility while appropriately setting consumer expectations.\u201d\n\nPhoto: iStock/Getty Images\n\nJoe Kordovi, an assistant vice president in a product-design division of Pacific Life Insurance Co., a top seller of the policies, says the insurer helped to develop the new guideline.

Photo: Fred C. McMahon\n\nMen and women have different experiences when it comes to Wall Street careers. And those differences fascinate Lily Fang.\n\nDr. Fang, an associate professor of finance on the Singapore campus of the business school Insead, has spent the past five years or so delving into how gender affects the career-development paths of stock-research analysts on Wall Street. What she and co-author Sterling Huang of Singapore Management University found was that the networking and personal connections that male analysts rely on so heavily to get ahead are much less useful for women in similar jobs.\n\nDr. Fang says the audience for this type of gender research has grown in recent years as it has become apparent that women\u2014despite making great strides in many competitive industries\u2014remain underrepresented in top echelons of the corporate world.\n\nA native of Shanghai with a doctoral degree from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, Dr. Fang is spending a year as a visiting associate professor at MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management in Cambridge, Mass.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal spoke with Dr. Fang about her work. An edited excerpt follows:\n\nWSJ: How did you get interested in the topic of gender differences on Wall Street?\n\nDR. FANG: The economics literature on gender and wage discrimination is quite large, but in the finance [industry] there isn\u2019t much. It was risky. When I presented it in a workshop, one of my senior colleagues said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a finance paper, because you don\u2019t talk about returns.\u201d But then I got tenure in 2012 and I could do what I was interested in.\n\nAnalysts are one of the few areas where you can look at data. The data is widely disseminated and very clean\u2014buy and sell calls that allow you to see how accurate the analysts are. When we started doing it, it became more interesting because the differences we found were subtle. It wasn\u2019t that men do better or women do better, but rather that the influence of connections on their outcomes is different.\n\nWSJ: What has changed to make people more receptive to this type of research?\n\nDR. FANG: There is more awareness. You cannot fail to observe that women have made significant strides in society in many fields. More than 50% of university graduates are women now. But in the top echelons of the corporate world and even in academia, things haven\u2019t changed that much. The rate of progress is so different. You\u2019d imagine that there would be more advancement, but there isn\u2019t.\n\nWSJ: Specifically, what did your research show about gender and Wall Street?\n\nDR. FANG: Finance is a very competitive field, and about 12% of analysts are female. In our paper, one of the main points is that there isn\u2019t blatant discrimination. When we look at the Institutional Investor star analysts, for example, 14% are women, so it isn\u2019t as though women aren\u2019t doing well. Rather, it\u2019s the factors that make them do well. If you\u2019re a woman, you have to demonstrate your performance. Good schools, measurable performance metrics like forecast accuracy\u2014those things get rewarded. For men, those things aren\u2019t as important; connections are. We don\u2019t have direct data, but the connections could mean [that men] have more information to incorporate into their earnings forecasts. For women, that doesn\u2019t come into play. Maybe women have to work more on their own.\n\nWSJ: What do you think financial firms, and women themselves, should take away from your research?\n\nDR. FANG: My own reading of the evidence tells me that [while] Wall Street firms have done a lot to promote gender diversity, there is more to be done. Simply doing things like bringing more women in or mentoring them more\u2014I\u2019m not sure how far that will go. There are all of these really capable women coming out of schools, and somehow they drop out in this career progression. Maybe the boys\u2019 club is still extremely strong and powerful in terms of advancing careers. Women should learn from the men and be a little more aggressive in capitalizing on their networks.\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

Mr. Bogle argued for it, Mr. Grant against it.\n\nMr. Bogle came out of his corner and swung a haymaker. He said he had been swarmed at the refreshment break by portfolio managers thanking him for \u201chelping them do well in their own personal portfolios\u201d\u2014which they had all invested in index funds instead of the funds they manage.\n\nThe crowd tittered nervously.\n\nMr. Bogle then argued that investment performance must equal the market\u2019s returns minus the costs of earning them. Between management fees and trading costs, he estimated, active funds cost roughly 2% annually; index funds, as little as 0.05% a year. Therefore, those who invest in index funds \u201cmust earn higher net returns,\u201d as a group, than those who don\u2019t.\n\nNor is indexing a fad, added Mr. Bogle; it is a new technology, much as electricity, the automobile or refrigeration were in decades past.\n\nMr. Grant counterpunched that indexing may be a superior way for \u201cthe average lay investor\u201d to manage money, but that \u201cought not to be true\u201d for \u201cthe accomplished professional investor.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that investing in an S&P 500 index fund means buying stocks picked by the committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices headed by David Blitzer and holding them in a market fueled by low interest rates determined by Janet Yellen \u2019s Federal Reserve.\n\n\u201cWhen you buy \u2018the market,\u2019 you are buying David\u2019s market and Janet Yellen\u2019s,\u201d said Mr. Grant. \u201cAre you quite sure you want it all?\u201d\n\nHe said Mr. Bogle \u201creminds me of a kind of Debbie Downer Little League coach who lines the kids up and says, \u2018I don\u2019t mean to sound discouraging, but in the big leagues it comes in at 93 mph\u2026and beyond that, your career\u2019s likely to be short, and most guys wash out in the minors.

So who\u2019s better at managing their cash? Vanguard\u2019s Jean Young joins MoneyBeat. Photo: iStock/Yuri_Arcurs\n\nWhen it comes to investing, men sometimes have their ways of doing things, and women have different ways.\n\nAnd each could learn from the other.\n\nBroad generalizations, of course, are inherently risky. And nobody would suggest that gender drives investment success.\n\nNonetheless, financial institutions and academics who have studied the respective investing habits of men and women do agree: Men are generally more confident about investing, while women are more goal-directed and trade less.\n\nThe point of such studies isn\u2019t to crown one sex or the other as the savvier investor, but to better understand where the strengths of each lie.\n\n\u201cWe should focus on the behaviors that empower individuals to do what\u2019s in their best interest,\u201d says Michael Liersch, head of behavioral finance at Bank of America Corp. \u2019s Merrill Lynch Wealth Management unit and author of a report on women and investing.\n\nData from various studies point to clear differences not only in the investing habits of men and women but in their retirement planning as well.\n\nWomen, for instance, are more likely than men to choose the target-date funds offered in employer-sponsored retirement accounts. Men tend to invest more in other options on the menu, including stock funds. Their overall stock exposure is about the same, on average, 74% for men and 73% for women in 2014, according to data from mutual-fund firm Vanguard Group. But target-date funds gradually reduce stockholdings as retirement approaches, something financial advisers generally recommend.\n\nMen also tend to trade more, which can be a disadvantage. In 2014, according to Vanguard, 11% of men made an exchange among mutual funds in their accounts, compared with 7% of women. By trading less often, women are less likely to trade at the wrong time, explains Jean Young, senior research analyst at Vanguard.\n\nDifferent horizons\n\nThe studies show that women might have a lot to teach in other areas, as well. They are more likely than men to participate in employer-sponsored retirement plans (73% at the end of last year, compared with 66% for men in Vanguard plans) and save a greater percentage of income (7% compared with 6.8% for men, according to the Vanguard data).\n\n\u201cWomen have a longer time horizon, they have a goal in mind and they are more willing to seek professional advice,\u201d says Rosanne Rog\u00e9, a financial planner in Bohemia, N.Y., whose clients include men and women. \u201cIt\u2019s the men who ask to keep some money on the side to manage on their own; they want to shoot the lights out.\u201d\n\n(Investing skills aside, women do often end up with a smaller nest egg at the end of their working lives, but for a simple reason: They earn less in their jobs. \u201cIt ends up being a wage story,\u201d Ms. Young says. \u201cMen save more because they earn more.\u201d)\n\nDespite the conventional wisdom that aversion to risk\u2014and stocks\u2014hinders what women can earn on their investments, studies show that their returns are similar to those of men over time. Vanguard, record-keeper for more than 5,000 defined-contribution retirement plans, found that women earned an average annual total return of 9.7% for the five years through 2014, compared with 10.1% for men.\n\nIllustration: John Kuczala for The Wall Street Journal\n\nConfidence game\n\nAnd here is the paradox: Since women are so strong in their belief about the value of saving, why is there also evidence that they don\u2019t seem to trust themselves in the same way when it comes to investing?\n\nFinancial experts say this is a main difference between men and women when it comes to financial matters. The Merrill report from Mr. Liersch, based on data from 11,500 investment personality assessments completed by Merrill clients, found that 55% of the women questioned agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, \u201cI know less than the average investor about financial markets and investing in general,\u201d compared with just 27% of the men.\n\nReluctance to invest more aggressively is especially evident when women have money to invest outside of an employer-sponsored retirement plan, says Kristen Robinson, a senior vice president at mutual-fund company Fidelity Investments. \u201cThey put it into a savings account,\u201d she says.\n\nIn a 2013 study of couples in a committed relationship, Fidelity found that women tend to have a much lower risk tolerance than men\u2014only 4% of women were willing to invest a substantial amount to achieve potentially higher returns, even if it meant possibly losing some or all of an initial investment, compared with 15% of men.\n\nOther studies of men\u2019s and women\u2019s investment behaviors reach similar conclusions. A survey by BlackRock Inc. found that women have a greater portion of their portfolios in cash and that few are willing to increase risk to seek higher returns. Merrill research found that more than half the women questioned feared losing principal, and more than a third expressed concern about not having access to cash when they need it.\n\nYet women are more likely to seek professional advice, which can be an advantage. \u201cThey want to make sure they understand the purpose of a strategy and how it will help them reach their goals,\u201d Mr. Liersch says. \u201cThese are questions every investor should be asking.\u201d\n\nWho\u2019s the \u2018do-it-yourselfer\u2019?\n\nWhen Fidelity analyzed data from 13 million participants in corporate retirement plans, it found that 42% of women used professionally managed accounts, compared with 36% of men\u2014the other 64% of men were designated \u201cdo-it-yourselfers.\u201d\n\nOther Fidelity research shows that 92% of women want to learn more about financial planning and 83% want to get more involved with their finances within the next year.\n\nBy learning from each other\u2019s best habits, investors of both sexes could benefit. \u201cYou can be overconfident, you can be underconfident,\u201d says Mr. Liersch. \u201cRegardless of how you feel, a dialogue can get you to a better place.\u201d\n\nMs. Jasen is a writer in New York.

Warren, a Wall Street critic, is investigating fancy vacations and other incentives for selling annuities. Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News\n\nIf an insurance agent pitches you an \u201cindexed annuity,\u201d here is something to ask: What fabulous prize are you helping him, or her, to win?\n\nThe question springs from a probe under way by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) targeting sales incentives for annuities, which are tax-deferred savings, investment and lifetime-income products issued by insurance companies. Much of the senator\u2019s focus is on the indexed annuity, widely known within the industry for the perks available to agents, according to industry executives and financial advisers.\n\nIn simplest terms, this type of annuity promises a return tied to a stock-market index, while guaranteeing against losses if the market falls. But it is much more complicated than that\u2014with serious limitations on the upside potential\u2014and long has been controversial because of the many ways consumers can misunderstand it, experts say.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2015, sales of indexed annuities rose 3% from the year-earlier quarter, to $11.6 billion, even as total U.S. annuity sales fell 7% to $54.4 billion, according to Limra, a research firm funded by the insurance industry.\n\nRoyal treatment\n\nIn letters dispatched in April to 15 of the nation\u2019s largest annuity issuers, Sen. Warren quoted from marketing materials aimed at insurance agents with a record of high-volume annuity sales, describing sales incentives including \u201cfour days in the heart of California\u2019s wine country at the prestigious Calistoga Ranch and Spa\u201d; a trip to South Africa to visit Cape Town and Kruger National Park; and the opportunity to \u201ctour the Mediterranean on a private yacht, like royalty, celebrities, and the wealthy elite.\u201d\n\nThe letters say perks also have included cash awards, car leases and, in at least one instance, \u201ca diamond-encrusted NFL Super Bowl Style ring with high-quality gold and a ruby in the middle.\u201d\n\nSen. Warren\u2019s letters seek from the insurers \u201ca list of all incentives,\u201d saying that annuity sellers who are \u201cmore interested in earning perks than in acting in their clients\u2019 best interest can place Americans\u2019 savings and retirement security at risk.\u201d\n\nSo, does that mean you should steer clear of indexed and other types of annuities?\n\nIndustry\u2019s defense\n\nThe American Council of Life Insurers says consumers should feel comfortable in their purchases. \u201cFrom product development to advertising to sales, life insurers offering annuities must comply with state and federal laws and rules that help protect consumers\u2019 interests,\u201d the trade group said in a statement after Sen. Warren\u2019s letters went out. \u201cState regulations include extensive product disclosure, strong suitability standards, as well as truth-in-advertising and credentialing requirements.\u201d\n\nStill, many financial advisers and even some insurance-industry executives advise caution. \u201cWhile I believe that an indexed annuity can find a place in many conservative investors\u2019 portfolios, I also believe it is a product that is frequently incorrectly sold,\u201d says Scott Stolz, president of the insurance and annuity division of securities firm Raymond James Financial Inc.\n\nHere is more of what you need to know if you are considering a purchase:\n\nTHE INNER WORKINGS: While the stock-market link is part of the pitch, financial advisers and agents who understand indexed annuities say they tell their clients to think of them more as juiced-up bank certificates of deposit. Insurers back the contracts mostly with bonds. Often, the return is pegged to the S&P 500, but increasingly insurers are using proprietary indexes.\n\nInsurers typically restrict the upside potential, setting a cap on annual gains at a given percentage figure or limiting them to a percentage of the index\u2019s gain, for instance. So even if the stock market is roaring, the consumer would likely get a single-digit return, Mr. Stolz says. What\u2019s more, insurers typically exclude dividends from the calculation of payouts, though these can notably boost results in a lackluster market year.\n\nAnd many indexed products\u2019 contracts allow insurers to adjust the participation in gains for the coming year, subject to specified minimums and maximums, says Lawrence Rybka, president of ValMark Securities Inc., a securities and insurance brokerage firm based in Akron, Ohio. He calls it \u201cchanging the deal for clients.\u201d\n\nSome\u2014and possibly many\u2014buyers don\u2019t understand the role of the upside restrictions when they lock themselves into the long-term contracts, critics say. Early-withdrawal penalties range from three to 16 years and the average is 10 years, according to Wink Inc., a market-research firm in the insurance and annuities industry.\n\n\u201cAn indexed annuity is not an equity investment in any way,\u201d Mr. Stolz says. \u201cAnyone who buys it as an equity alternative is going to be disappointed at the results.\u201d\n\nAgents\u2019 commissions are paid by the insurer; the expense is built into the product. In general, the higher the commission, the longer the period during which early-withdrawal penalties, also known as surrender charges, apply. \u201cLook for indexed annuities with surrender-charge periods of seven years or less, and you will likely have one that offers good consumer value,\u201d Mr. Stolz says.\n\nTHE BEST USES: Indexed annuities can work well for conservative savers who want to earn, on average, 1.5 to three percentage points a year more than they would get on bank CDs over a seven- to 10-year period, Mr. Stolz says. They also are preferable to bank CDs in that the interest is tax-deferred until it is withdrawn from the contract.\n\nSome indexed annuities include riders, for an extra cost, to guarantee monthly income for life, an attractive feature to those who don\u2019t have an old-fashioned pension plan and worry about outliving their savings. And some also offer long-term-care benefits should the buyer become incapable of independent living.\n\nStan Haithcock, an annuity specialist who is a critic of aggressive sales tactics and is quoted in Ms. Warren\u2019s letters, cautions that consumers buying an indexed annuity for the lifetime-income feature should purchase only those issued by highly rated carriers. Some indexed annuities make sense \u201cif fully explained by the agent and understood by the client,\u201d he says. Mr. Haithcock contributes regularly on annuities to MarketWatch.com, which is published by News Corp\u2019s Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal.\n\nValMark\u2019s Mr. Rybka says potential buyers should consider whether other types of annuities would work better for creating a lifetime income stream. He says his firm\u2019s brokers sell few indexed annuities, because they find drawbacks often outweigh advantages.\n\nMs. Scism is a news editor for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

But a mutual fund\u2019s list of top 10 holdings isn\u2019t as satisfying.\n\nThat is because the listed holdings aren\u2019t necessarily still the fund\u2019s favorites.\n\nA mutual fund is permitted to delay reporting portfolio holdings for as long as 60 days following the end of its fiscal quarter. In practice, many funds publish a complete list of their holdings on their websites 30 days after the quarter ends. Top 10 holdings and their percentage weightings in the portfolio frequently are made available online monthly with a 10- or 15-day lag.\n\nIt all means that when you look at where a fund manager is investing your money, what you see is not always what you\u2019ve got.\n\nFund companies argue that a delay protects fund investors, particularly in stock funds. The lag, the companies say, discourages traders from taking advantage of a fund\u2019s buying and selling. Funds are especially concerned about so-called front-running, where traders move in or out of a stock knowing that a big institutional investor intends to do the same, thereby affecting prices at the expense of fund shareholders.\n\nYet this defensive line doesn\u2019t hold with some fund-industry observers.\n\n\u201cMutual funds hide behind this cloak of front-running, but they\u2019re really not telling you much about what you own,\u201d says Matt Hougan, chief executive of ETF.com, a provider of exchange-traded-fund research. Unlike mutual funds, index-tracking ETFs typically disclose portfolio holdings daily.\n\nAdds Mr. Hougan: \u201cThe arguments against it are weak, and investors deserve better.\u201d\n\nA better way\n\nIn fact, there is a way for fund companies to give investors up-to-date portfolio information and thwart front-running.\n\nResearch shows that for stock funds, factors including sector allocation and style consistency influence returns more than the selection of individual stocks. In other words, in evaluating a fund, where and how a manager invests is more telling than what\u2019s being bought and sold.\n\nCurrent industry practice is to divulge information about a fund simultaneously with its portfolio holdings. But fund companies could provide daily updates of crucial portfolio drivers like sector and country allocation, volatility, average market capitalization and key valuation measures.\n\nMeanwhile, the fund\u2019s portfolio holdings could continue to be published on a delayed basis to counter front-running.\n\nMost investors probably would be fine with such an arrangement. For a long-term shareholder, whether a mutual fund has 2.1% or 2.2% of assets in Apple stock isn\u2019t important. But knowing that the fund is buying technology stocks and selling the energy sector, for example, offers perspective on a manager\u2019s strategy and market view.\n\nFront-running, meanwhile, which is stock-specific and not based on factors as broad as sector allocation or rotation, would still be discouraged.\n\n\u2018One giant leap forward\u2019\n\nPutting investors first in this way could revolutionize and harmonize how mutual funds and shareholders relate. Says Mr. Hougan: \u201cIt would be one giant leap forward for the mutual-fund industry. Let\u2019s empower investors and let managers have their desired opacity.\u201d\n\nIn its current form, \u201ctop holdings are a window, and not much more,\u201d says Charles Rotblut, a vice president of the American Association of Individual Investors. And it is an opaque window at that. Fact is, top 10 holdings are just a starting point to evaluate a fund.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only one piece of a broader puzzle as to how that fund is managed,\u201d says Mr. Rotblut.\n\nFitting the pieces together requires digging into a mutual fund\u2019s inner workings: long-term results, manager tenure and expenses. Investors also should be aware of the four P\u2019s that investment advisers tend to consider when selecting funds for clients\u2014investment process, the people managing the fund, their performance record and the reputation of the fund\u2019s parent company.\n\nInvestors also can gain perspective in cases where mutual-fund managers use quarterly letters to shareholders to convey their market outlooks and to highlight recent investment decisions that did and didn\u2019t work.\n\nGlance at a few quarters\u2019 worth of commentary, says Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund and ETF research at S&P Capital IQ. \u201cYou want a manager to tell you what happened,\u201d Mr. Rosenbluth says. \u201cDid management take bets you\u2019re not comfortable they took? How is the fund positioning itself? What is management\u2019s investment approach?\u201d\n\nPortfolio turnover\u2014a measure of trading activity\u2014is also telling. If a fund\u2019s turnover is greater than 50% annually, top holdings might shift even more rapidly. This is especially the case with small-cap and midcap stock funds, which tend to see more trading.\n\nTurnover below 50% indicates that management is being more patient and holding on to stocks longer. \u201cYou can feel better that what they show as a top 10 holding was a top holding months ago and will continue to be,\u201d Mr. Rosenbluth says.\n\nSome value\n\nLooking at top 10 holdings does have some value, of course. These investments typically reflect a manager\u2019s best, highest-conviction ideas at one point in time. More useful, however, is to note when top holdings make up a large percentage of a portfolio, which means the fund probably will be less diversified. Such a strategy may be fine\u2014if you have confidence in the manager.\n\nSays Mr. Rosenbluth: \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel comfortable with what you\u2019re seeing, which is just a glimpse of the portfolio, then you shouldn\u2019t be buying the fund even if it has a very good track record.\u201d\n\nMr. Burton is a writer and editor at MarketWatch in San Francisco.

The index launched by tracking six stocks just two years ago, but now tracks 200 with a combined market value of $6.9 billion.\n\nMr. Brochstein\u2019s own model portfolio of marijuana stocks provides a look at the many subsectors: a 19% allocation to Canadian licensed producers; 18% to vaporizer smoking devices; 14% to GW Pharmaceuticals, a listed British biopharmaceutical company that makes cannabis-based medication; 14% to grower supplies; 9% to cannabis concentrates; 7.5% to air-control and lighting for indoor cannabis growers; 4% to cannabis-based biotech; and the remainder in cash and technology.\n\nMutual funds next?\n\nInevitably, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds will look at opportunities in marijuana-related businesses. When that happens, investors who object to such businesses may want to look closely at the holdings of any funds they invest in, as investors do who don\u2019t want to own liquor or conventional-tobacco stocks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there will be funds and ETFs in the cannabis sector for at least a couple of years,\u201d says Mr. Brochstein. \u201cLiquidity in this space is poor, so mostly you have over-the-counter stocks trading publicly.\u201d\n\nDespite the lack of liquidity, investors are curious.

And even if the Fed raises rates gradually, higher short-term rates will ripple through the markets and affect a wide range of financial products that are based on market yields, from fixed-income funds to mortgage loans and credit cards.\n\nThe impacts will be uneven. Some borrowing costs are likely to rise closely in sync with short-term rates, but others won\u2019t. And people who depend on interest income might not benefit from rising rates for months.\n\nThere is still time to get ready, perhaps by reviewing a mutual-fund portfolio, paying down debt or moving to lock in the rate on a loan. Here are ways the Fed\u2019s actions could affect certain investments and financial products:\n\nEffects on bond investments\n\nWhile any increase in the federal-funds rate\u2014the overnight lending rate used by banks\u2014will quickly nudge yields higher on government-bond maturities as far out as three to five years, yields of longer-term Treasurys might not react as much. That is because long-term U.S. government bond levels are influenced more by developments such as shifting expectations about inflation and strong global demand for yield.\n\nFor as long as the Fed\u2019s stimulus continued, investors were forced to own longer maturities to get any return at all. As short rates rise, however, shorter-term debt and even cash eventually will become more attractive versus longer-term bonds, says Gareth Isaac, a senior fixed-income manager at U.K. money manager Schroders PLC.\n\nAs some investors shift money out of longer maturities into less-volatile, shorter-term debt securities, selling would push long-term bond prices downward and yields upward, he adds. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, so a rise in yields means bonds are losing principal value in the resale market.\n\nSome popular bond strategies might pose more risk than investors realize. One is a big bet on high-yield, or junk, bonds\u2014those issued by companies with lower credit ratings. Because such bonds carry higher default risk, they yield two to three percentage points more than bonds with top credit ratings.\n\nIn the past, such bonds have done well despite Fed tightening, as long as the economy and corporate revenues were growing at a decent pace. But Fed stimulus has helped support prices of riskier assets such as high-yield bonds, says Sarah Bush, senior fund analyst at Morningstar Inc. As the Fed pulls away from stimulus, that could hurt high-yield more than in the past.\n\nAnother strategy that could prove less effective than in the past is owning a very-short-maturity-bond fund. Although short-maturity bonds are less volatile than longer maturities, their yields are so low that they won\u2019t provide much cushion from rising yields at the short end of the Treasurys market.\n\nFor people who want to continue holding some bonds for diversification, Ms. Bush suggests an intermediate-maturity, core bond fund\u2014those that typically own a diverse mix of five- to seven-year maturities. Investors should plan to hold such a fund through an entire rate cycle, she says. Although intermediate funds could lose some principal value if bond yields rise, the impact of that rise would be at least partially offset by the higher interest such funds pay.\n\nSavings rates will trail the Fed...\n\nAlthough markets influence bank-deposit rates, it is the banks that set the rates. Rates vary because some banks rely more on consumer deposits for funding than others and raise rates only when they want to attract deposits.\n\nFew banks need to do that now, says Ted Peters, a veteran banker and former board member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. \u201cThere is a tremendous amount of liquidity in the market, so banks aren\u2019t really hungry for deposits,\u201d he says.\n\nMoreover, he notes, by raising deposit rates more slowly than any rise in short-term market rates, banks can realize bigger profit margins. If short-term rates rose by one percentage point, deposit rates might rise by only 0.40 to 0.60 point, Mr. Peters says.\n\n...As will money-market rates\n\nAlthough money-market funds must keep weighted average portfolio maturities at 60 days or shorter, it can take several months before they replace all of the securities they own with new ones paying higher yields. That means returns will improve slowly, says David Glocke, principal and portfolio manager for Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund. \u201cThe Fed isn\u2019t expected to raise rates aggressively, so income-oriented investors are going to continue to be at a disadvantage for some time yet,\u201d Mr. Glocke says.\n\nMoreover, with investment returns so low in short-term markets, firms that offer money-market funds have been struggling just to cover their own expenses. Even as rates move higher, those firms may be reluctant to immediately pass along all of the added yield they get to fund holders, analysts believe.\n\nFixed mortgages could hover\n\nRates for fixed-rate, 30-year-mortgage loans key off the 10-year Treasury yield. So, with most observers predicting 10-year yields will remain fairly stable as the Fed begins to tighten, people with relatively good credit standing should continue to see loan rates near 4% or only a little higher, says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.\n\nThe national average 30-year-mortgage rate recently stood just above 4%.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s Janet Yellen is expected to hit the button sometime this year. Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News\n\nBut home buyers should be wary of adjustable-rate-mortgage loans, Mr. McBride says. The rates on such loans are pegged to a variable rate index, sometimes the London interbank offered rate, or some other rate benchmark that rises or falls along with short-term interest rates generally. The bigger concern, however, is that during the first five to 10 years that you hold an adjustable-rate loan, the rate is artificially low. It\u2019s a teaser rate. Once that initial period ends, the rate automatically adjusts upward\u2014by two percentage points in many cases\u2014regardless of what is happening with short-term rates generally. This can jack up monthly payments significantly.\n\nPeople should take adjustable-rate mortgages only if they expect to sell a home before the rate is scheduled to adjust upward, Mr. McBride says.\n\nCredit-card choices will narrow\n\nBecause short-term rates are so low, credit-card firms commonly have been offering cards with a 0% introductory rate for the first year or so. After that, the rate might jump to 18% or higher.\n\nOnce the Fed begins raising rates, those 0% offers could disappear, says Mr. McBride, since the banks\u2019 funding costs will increase as well. Thus it can be advisable to get a 0% card while still available, especially since it allows the cardholder to pay no interest on the balance while he or she pays it down.\n\nPeople carrying large credit-card balances also can use a 0% card to help pay down a balance transferred from another card. Such cards can provide \u201ca tailwind\u201d toward debt repayment, Mr. McBride says. \u201cThe goal should be paying off the balance before the promotional rate expires.\u201d\n\nMr. Pollock is a writer in Ridgewood, N.J.

Photo: iStock/Getty Images\n\nInvestors\u2019 love affair with exchange-traded funds has helped fuel the popularity of low-cost automated investing. But automated doesn\u2019t mean uniform. Ask three computers how to set up your portfolio, and you\u2019ll get three different answers.\n\nUnderstanding the differences can help investors decide which of the so-called robo advisers is best for them.\n\nModern portfolio theory, the foundation for all the robo advisers, attempts to maximize returns and minimize risk by spreading money around a diverse mix of asset classes and regions.\n\nThat\u2019s why ETFs are so handy. They are baskets of securities that track a given index, whether that be the S&P 500, the Barclays Aggregate or any one of dozens of others. Put together in a portfolio, they are a relatively simple and low-cost way to track a broad array of securities all at once.\n\nThere are differences in how each adviser approaches what mix of funds to use, however.\n\nHow many ETFs in the pot?\n\nAt their most basic, the robos build portfolios of ETFs using an approach called strategic asset allocation. This is a buy-and-hold style that factors in an investor\u2019s risk tolerance, investment time horizon and objective, and makes a portfolio that has target percentages for each asset class. The portfolio is continually rebalanced back to those original percentage targets.\n\nBut some advisers use only a handful of ETFs to construct portfolios, while others use as many as 20. And there is a long-running debate on whether small-cap stocks and emerging-markets investments are good for portfolios. Both add risk and can have higher costs than investments in larger-cap stocks and developed markets\u2014but both offer the potential for higher returns.\n\nAmong many variations on these themes, Wealthfront Inc., a San Francisco-based provider of automated portfolios, skews to emerging markets, while its rival, New York-based Betterment LLC, puts more small-cap stocks in its portfolios in addition to a smattering of emerging-markets funds.\n\nThe robo portfolios designed by Charles Schwab Corp. add another twist: fundamental asset allocation. Many big ETFs are weighted by market cap\u2014the bigger a stock\u2019s market capitalization, the bigger the percentage of that security in the fund. Fundamental ETFs are weighted according to different measures, such as sales or revenue, an approach that some analysts believe can give more weight in a portfolio to undervalued stocks. Schwab\u2019s Intelligent Portfolios range of robo offerings, for example, includes holdings of fundamental ETFs that invest in the same securities as their traditional counterparts, just in different proportions, and they sit alongside traditional ETFs in the same portfolio.\n\nCritics of this \u201csmart beta\u201d investing approach point out that fundamental funds are more costly than traditional ETFs. Fundamental funds also have to be more actively managed to stick to their index, where market-cap-weighted funds naturally rebalance; that makes fundamental funds less tax-efficient.\n\n\u201cThey are active bets and not substitutes for traditional index funds,\u201d says recent research from Vanguard Group, which recently introduced its own automated index-fund investment product.\n\nIs the best the best?\n\nAndrew Rachleff, Wealthfront\u2019s co-founder and chairman, says some investors get hung up on whether the ETFs used to build robo portfolios are the best performers in a category.\n\nOne problem with that, he recently wrote, is that the best-performing fund might closely mimic the movements of other funds in the portfolio, which doesn\u2019t help maximize the portfolio\u2019s return over a range of market conditions. A better mix of funds includes some whose movements aren\u2019t so closely correlated, Mr. Rachleff says.\n\nTaxes are also a consideration for taxable accounts, he says. A manager estimating pretax returns might be tempted to overlook relatively low-yielding municipal bonds in favor of corporate bonds. But based on after-tax returns, the muni bond, with its federal and state tax-exempt benefits, might be a better investment.\n\nThe biggest controversy has been the role of cash in a robo portfolio. Many advisers (humans, that is) maintain a sliver of cash in a client\u2019s portfolio to handle fees and provide liquidity. But Schwab got people talking when it disclosed that its Intelligent Portfolios have 4% to 30% cash as part of their asset allocation. Schwab makes money for itself by investing at least some of that cash overnight. It is also able to offer its robo product free of fees, unlike other robo firms, which charge 0.25% to 0.5% of a portfolio\u2019s assets annually.\n\nRivals point out that uninvested cash can be a drag on performance. But a Schwab spokesman says cash plays an important role in a portfolio as a source of stability, downside protection and diversification. The real drag on returns, the spokesman says, is when investors pay too much in advisory fees.\n\nMs. Moyer is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

He didn\u2019t anticipate the annual cost of his four insurance policies soaring to $30,000. Photo: Vertullo family\n\nRetired high-school teacher Nicholas Vertullo long felt confident that his wife, Grace, wouldn\u2019t have to pinch pennies after he died. Nearly three decades ago, he bought a $238,000 life-insurance policy, and later bought three more policies, pushing the death benefit to about $500,000.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t anticipate the policies\u2019 annual costs would rise as much as they did, jumping to about $30,000 combined.\n\n\u201cLaying out this kind of money is a hell of a thing for a fellow living on a pension and Social Security,\u201d says the 82-year-old Airmont, N.Y., resident, who aims to keep the policies in force.\n\nIt is one of the most damaging but least-understood ramifications of years of low interest rates: Mr. Vertullo is among millions stung by the intricacies of a type of life insurance that combines tax-deferred savings with a death benefit.\n\nKnown as \u201cuniversal life,\u201d these policies accounted for more than 25% of all individual life-insurance sales for much of the 1980s, when the 10-year Treasury yield peaked at 15%. While the 10-year Treasury is off its mid-2012 low of 1.404%, any big increase will come too late for many who bought policies in the 1980s, financial advisers say.\n\nUniversal life works like this: The buyer deposits money into the policy. The insurer deducts for expenses, including the cost of the death benefit, and the rest of the money stays in the policy earning interest to help pay some, or all, of the future costs. The annual cost of the death benefit typically rises as the holder ages, to reflect higher chances of death.\n\nDuring the sales process, agents typically work up \u201cillustrations\u201d to show how the savings build. But the 8%-10% rates highlighted by many agents in years past weren\u2019t guaranteed\u2014which buyers like Mr. Vertullo say they didn\u2019t fully understand.\n\nThe prevalence of so many contracts among badly informed consumers is \u201cthe insurance industry\u2019s dirty, not-so-little secret,\u201d says Henry Montag, a principal with TOLI Center East in Long Island, N.Y., which advises trusts on insurance issues.\n\nInsurers say they had to reduce interest payments when yields in their own investment portfolios fell. They say their sales materials clearly disclosed that only a minimum rate\u20144% or 4.5% in many 1980s-era policies\u2014would be guaranteed.\n\nMr. Vertullo\u2019s problems have been exacerbated because at times he deposited insufficient money into the policies for savings buildup, according to his records of payments and charges. Advisers say many buyers weren\u2019t adequately alerted that they would need to make bigger payments if rates fell. \u201cI should have been wiser, but sadly I wasn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Vertullo says of the policies in general.\n\nMiddle-class problem\n\nThe middle class bears the brunt of the problem, some advisers say. The rich often have institutional trustees managing their affairs, and many dealt with the developing interest shortfalls early on, including by swapping into sometimes-cheaper policies. (See chart for what to do if you own an older universal-life policy.)\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d says James Woods Sr., 71, a former New York City social worker, of the jump in 2013 to $6,000 a year for a $100,000 policy. He had been paying about $700 a year since the 1980s. He canceled the policy and took a job to supplement his Social Security and small pension, hoping he\u2019ll have something to leave to his children.\n\nSome advisers fault insurers for not having searched their records years ago to identify underperforming policies. \u201cThe problem of lapsing contracts is huge, and carriers generally do not have a financial interest in seeing policies persist,\u201d says Lawrence Rybka, president of Valmark Securities, an Akron, Ohio, insurance and brokerage firm that helps advisers monitor policies for clients.\n\nWhit Cornman, a spokesman for the American Council of Life Insurers trade group, says: \u201cLife-insurance policies are long-term commitments, and life insurers underwrite them with this in mind.\u2026Companies make a commitment to pay that claim the day the policy is signed.\u201d\n\nMore increases on way?\n\nAegon NV\u2019s Transmerica unit this summer told about 26,000 customers with policies dating to 1987-98 that it is increasing certain charges. It is acting \u201cbased on our expectations as to what it will cost us in the future to provide the coverage\u201d given low interest rates, spokesman Gregory Tucker said in an email.\n\nThe issues with older UL policies aren\u2019t \u201cspecific to our customers,\u201d Mr. Tucker said, adding that the higher charges \u201cwill still be below the maximum rates allowable\u201d under these contracts.\n\nAt least one other insurer also has raised rates, citing similar concerns. Michael Brohawn of ITM/TwentyFirst, a provider of policy-management services to institutions, says more increases may be on the way. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of other universal-life products that are being reviewed with the expectation that pricing will increase,\u201d he says.\n\nMs. Scism is a news editor for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

One winning phrase: \u201cgoal-directed investments.\u201d\n\nThe broader question is whether it\u2019s a good thing to try to make investors comfortable with these investment vehicles that use strategies such as short selling, leveraging and derivatives\u2014strategies that once were limited to the likes of hedge funds.\n\nPower of words\n\nInvesco, for its part, doesn\u2019t doubt the usefulness of the products. \u201cThe good news is for the first time in probably eight years, investors are open to new ideas,\u201d says Scott West, head of Invesco Consulting, which did the study. \u201cThe bad news is, you have to be very careful how you introduce a new idea.\u201d\n\nThe findings seem to show a preference for simplicity over jargon. For example, the study found that investors respond better to the phrase \u201calternative mutual funds that are bought and sold like any other fund\u201d instead of \u201cliquid alternatives,\u201d even though they are technically the same thing.\n\n\u201cWith the term \u2018liquid alternatives,\u2019 you\u2019re combining two words that clients already don\u2019t understand,\u201d says Michael Maslansky, chief executive of Maslansky + Partners, the language-strategy firm involved in the study.\n\nWhen respondents were asked what terms represented investments they would rather make, 9% said they would prefer \u201calternative investments.\u201d Some 37% preferred \u201cportfolio complements.\u201d But \u201cgoal-directed investments\u201d scored 50%, according to the findings, which were released in June and based on three focus-group dial sessions, a national survey of 800 investors and adviser interviews.\n\nClarification or spin?\n\nSome experts see the exercise by Invesco as just a marketing move rather than an effort to educate investors.\n\n\u201cThis is just spin,\u201d says Micah Hauptman, financial-services counsel for the Consumer Federation of America. \u201cThe financial industry is great at doing things like this, creating and marketing products that pay themselves a lot of money that aren\u2019t necessary for the vast majority of investors.\u201d\n\n\u2018The reality is that a lot of alternative mutual funds are using more-complex strategies than investors are accustomed to dealing with.\u2019 \u2014Morningstar\u2019s Josh Charlson\n\nInvesco\u2019s Mr. West disagrees with characterizations of the study as an attempt to rebrand investments that consumers wouldn\u2019t normally choose. \u201cThe idea that we would be trying to mislead somehow is the exact opposite of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d says Mr. West. He says the study shows the importance of educating consumers about alternatives in ways they will actually understand.\n\nTake the idea of diversification by investing in markets that move in different directions. Advisers usually describe such investments as \u201cnoncorrelated,\u201d a term that means nothing to the typical investor, Mr. West says.\n\nAdvisers instead should use language Invesco\u2019s study found more appealing to investors, he says, which was describing such investments as ones that \u201cbehave independently.\u201d\n\nJosh Charlson, director of manager research for alternative strategies at investment researcher Morningstar Inc., says findings such as Invesco\u2019s demonstrate the need for balance. There is a risk of oversimplifying alternative investments for clients, he says.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that a lot of alternative mutual funds are using more-complex strategies than investors are accustomed to dealing with. I think that can be off-putting or scary to investors, and possibly for good reason,\u201d he says.\n\nStill, Mr. Charlson says Invesco\u2019s study could be helpful if it makes alternatives easier to comprehend. Advisers typically recommend that clients allocate around 6% to 20% of a portfolio to alternatives, he says. Too much exposure can be risky, but too little can mean the alternatives won\u2019t have the desired hedging effect on the portfolio.\n\nJargon takes a holiday when Kent Grealish, a fee-only investment adviser with Grealish Investment Counseling in San Bruno, Calif., discusses alternative mutual funds with his clients: \u201cI tell them, \u2018Look, these are high-risk investments with high fees, and there really are only two things that investors have any control over that are important: One is expenses, and the second is how much risk they take on.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Wells is a news editor for The Wall Street Journal in London.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/be-ready-for-the-next-investing-crisis-1439172119", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Reuters (4)\n\nGet ready for the next crisis.\n\nSix years into a bull market for stocks and bonds, there is no shortage of reasons to prepare for trouble.\n\nU.S. stocks are close to their most expensive levels since 2004, even as interest rates seem headed higher. China\u2019s economy and financial markets have turned fragile, Brazil is under pressure and a bailout of Greece might not work. The U.S. tech-stock boom could go bust and high-profile investors are gearing up for a crisis in the expanding world of exchange-traded funds.\n\nIt isn\u2019t time to sell everything and head for the hills. Longtime investor Jeremy Grantham, chief investment strategist at GMO LLC in Boston, says stocks need to rise another 10% or so before they reach bubble territory. Still, Mr. Grantham, who counts 28 financial bubbles around the globe since 1920, argues that stocks are overvalued.\n\nWhether one agrees that stocks are approaching bubble territory or not, well-planned investment portfolios require a dose of protection. Currently there are few obvious ways, however. Gold prices keep falling, safe investments have puny expected returns. Bonds with any risk attached to them increasingly move in the same direction as stocks, reducing their ability to hedge a portfolio.\n\nBelow are some potential storms on the horizon, and possible ways to prepare for them.\n\nTech Stocks Pull Down the Market, Again\n\nThe stock market is up so far this year, led by tech stocks. But the sector is rising on the backs of just a few stocks. More than half of the gain of the Nasdaq-100 index\u2014which tracks the 100 largest Nasdaq nonfinancial companies\u2014is because of just two stocks, as of Friday\u2019s close: Amazon.com Inc. and Google Inc., says Mike O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Conn.\n\nWhen relatively few stocks are leading the way, trouble could be around the bend for the entire market. That is what happened in early 2000 when highflying tech shares soared and then collapsed. Today, one or two ugly earnings reports from the tech titans could be enough to disrupt the broader market.\n\nAnother reason for caution: The S&P 500 is trading at almost 18 times its companies\u2019 profits for the past 12 months, well above its long-term average of 15.7. \u201cThe only time the multiple has expanded beyond this level for an extended period of time has been during bubbles or recessions,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke says, arguing that investors need to be prepared for rougher markets.\n\nThe Solutions: Bold and Boring\n\nThe first defensive move is to make sure a portfolio isn\u2019t overcommitted to technology or any single sector, of course. But shorting, or betting against, tech shares can be dangerous. These stocks could keep climbing, crippling any bearish trades.\n\nInstead, some advisers recommend active investors buy long-term \u201cput\u201d contracts on PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1 (symbol QQQ), a heavily traded ETF tracking the tech-intensive Nasdaq-100. These put contracts, which give holders the right, but not the obligation, to sell the index at a set price, should appreciate in a market downturn.\n\nPuts can be expensive, notes Jack Rivkin, chief executive of Altegris Advisors in La Jolla, Calif. A three-month put contract to protect against a more than 10% downdraft in a $100,000 portfolio would cost about $635, or more than 2\u00bd% of the value of the holding if the protection were purchased every quarter for a year, based on recent prices. If the QQQ were to fall 10% during the period covered, an investor would make about $3,000 from the put contract, assuming there\u2019s about two months until the contract expires.\n\nGregory Curtis, chairman of Greycourt & Co. in Pittsburgh, is a fan of placing stop-loss orders on tech stocks, a standing order to automatically sell if they drop 15%. If they do, investors should then shift that money to an ETF that tracks value shares, he says. One idea: Vanguard Value ETF (VTV).\n\nFor all investors, including those mainly in the market through a 401(k), holding safe investments is a must. A smattering of cash, CDs and short-term Treasurys can help stabilize a portfolio in a crisis. They also discourage investors from dumping riskier holdings with better long-term prospects, says William Bernstein, an investment manager and author in Portland, Ore. Turn the clock back to, say, early March 2009 and ask yourself just how much in cash, CDs and Treasurys\u201d would have been enough to help you hold off on selling riskier assets at low prices, he says.\n\nCash also lets investors hunt for bargains when markets stabilize.\n\nChina Goes Downhill and the Greek Bailout Fails\n\nThe Chinese stock market is down about 31% since mid-June, the worst performance in more than eight years. If troubles persist, questions could grow about the Chinese government\u2019s ability to steer the debt-laden economy.\n\nMeanwhile, investors are increasingly nervous about Brazil\u2019s weakening economy, and Europe\u2019s agreement regarding Greece\u2019s debts might not have more success than two earlier bailouts.\n\nThe Solution: Volatility Plays\n\nIf geopolitical events cripple the market, a fund that sticks to low-volatility stocks, such as PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV), could hold up well. But the biggest payoff likely will be from investments that rise as the market\u2019s volatility surges, argues Robert Gordon, president of Twenty-First Securities Corp. in New York.\n\nThese strategies aren\u2019t for novices. Mr. Gordon recommends call options\u2014which give holders the right to buy shares at a specified price\u2014on the volatility index known as the VIX. These options can be bought through any brokerage. Options can move quickly and cause big losses or they can expire worthless.\n\nOther investments that aim to profit when volatility rises: exchange-traded notes such as iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX), which track the CBOE Market Volatility Index; and ETFs like ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures (VIXY), which tries to match the performance of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index.\n\nFor those looking to bet against expensive Chinese shares, some advisers recommend shorting KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB), which tracks the CSI Overseas China Internet Index, or Global X Nasdaq China Technology (QQQC), which tracks the Nasdaq OMX China Technology Index. But be careful: China\u2019s government is trying to prop up its stock market. If it succeeds, shorting these funds could lead to losses.\n\nCentral Bankers Bungle It\n\nMarkets have faith in central bankers fighting to generate global growth. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve is expected to begin raising rates, though few expect a recession soon.\n\nBut the recent slide in commodity prices could portend a global economic slowdown, some say. And corporate bonds could be hurt if the U.S. economy slips or the Fed raises rates at a faster pace than economists expect.\n\nThe worst part of the 2008 financial crisis \u201cwas seeing high-grade corporate bonds, munis, and even TIPS\u2014which most folks considered safe\u2014get slammed,\u201d says Mr. Bernstein.\n\nThe Solutions: Long-Term Bonds and (Gulp) Gold\n\nAs the Fed raises rates, investors should shift into\u2014not away from\u2014long-term Treasurys, argue some managers, including Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive officer of DoubleLine Capital LP in Los Angeles.\n\nInstead of reacting to Fed moves, these bonds tend to respond to forecasts of inflation. Inflation currently is subdued and will face further headwinds when the Fed raises rates.\n\n\u201cRising short-term rates could lead to lower long-term rates as the marketplace signals the increased likelihood of a recession,\u201d says Darren Pollock, portfolio manager of Cheviot Value Management in Los Angeles, who says it is unusual for the Fed to increase rates when the economy remains sluggish.\n\nGold prices are down about 40% since peaking at nearly $1,900 in 2011. But if markets lose confidence in the ability of the Fed and other central banks to prop up markets, gold will perk up, predicts hedge-fund manager Bob Wiedemer, who notes that gold tends to attract interest when doubts grow about values of leading currencies. Just don\u2019t keep more than a few percentage points of a portfolio in gold, which generates no income or dividends, advisers warn.\n\nBond ETFs Blow Up\n\nRecently, high-profile investors including Carl Icahn warned of a potential crisis in the expanding world of bond-focused exchange-traded funds.\n\nBecause Wall Street bond dealers play a smaller role in markets today, a bond-market scare could spark a rush of selling by individual investors in ETFs and mutual funds. In such a scenario, these vehicles could find they have fewer buyers to sell to.\n\nBill Gross, who helped found Pacific Investment Management Co. and now runs a fund for Janus Capital, recently wrote that \u201cmutual funds, ETFs, and even index funds\u201d are vulnerable in a downturn. \u201cThe obvious risk\u2014perhaps better labeled the \u2018liquidity illusion\u2019\u2014is that all investors cannot fit through a narrow exit at the same time,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe Solution: Mortgages and Bearish Bets\n\nSreeni Prabhu, chief investment officer of Angel Oak Capital Advisors in Atlanta, recommends shifting to bonds that are less frequently found in funds and ETFs, such as residential mortgages. One mortgage-focused fund recommended by Maury Fertig, chief investment officer of Relative Value Partners in Northbrook, Ill., is TCW Strategic Income Fund (TSI), a closed-end fund with a chunk of its portfolio in residential and commercial mortgage bonds, as well as other asset-backed bonds, investments that most individual investors have limited access to. Today, lenders no longer court risky borrowers, making the mortgage market safer than in the housing crisis in 2008.\n\nBuying put contracts on iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond (HYG), the most liquid junk-bond ETF, is a way to profit if there\u2019s a run on junk bonds, according to hedge funds placing this bearish trade. Others say bank loans could be hurt in a bond crisis because there can be limited trading in these investments. They are shorting or buying put contracts on PowerShares Senior Loan ETF (BKLN), which tracks an index of loans made to debt-heavy companies.\n\nMr. Zuckerman is a special writer for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Women manage less than 3% of mutual funds exclusively and less than 2% of the $12.6 trillion in assets.\n\nThe women who do have authority are more likely to be managing a fund as part of a mixed-gender team. Teams of male and female managers run 24% of the industry\u2019s assets and about 20% of its funds, Morningstar found.\n\nThe disparity has nothing to do with performance, according to Sallie Krawcheck, the former Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. senior executive who now runs Ellevate Network, a global professional women\u2019s organization, and Ellevate Asset Management.\n\nThyra E. Zerhusen of Fairpointe says women can do one thing better than some men: focus on what can go wrong. Photo: Kevin J. Miyazaki/Redux\n\nWhile there is some research suggesting that women are better portfolio managers than men, \u201cI have never seen any research that says they are worse,\u201d says Ms. Krawcheck.\n\nSo why are there so few female fund managers?\n\nFor one thing, fewer women than men seek and earn the credentials that fund firms typically want, says Laura Pavlenko Lutton, director of manager research for equity strategies at Morningstar and an author of the report. Indeed, among 307 member schools responding, just 37% of the M.B.A. degrees earned during the 2013-14 academic year went to women, according to the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, or AACSB International. And CFA Institute, an association of investment professionals, reports that in 2014 just 16% of its 61,282 U.S. members were women.\n\n\u201cThat narrows the field pretty dramatically,\u201d says Ms. Lutton.\n\nA lack of role models and wariness over how the financial-services industry treats women also plays a role, Ms. Krawcheck says.\n\nChange on the way?\n\nStill, she and others are optimistic that the number of female fund managers will increase in coming years.\n\nThe fact that there are far more female chartered financial analysts than there are female fund managers means there is plenty of room for growth, Ms. Lutton says.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, women now control more wealth than ever, a trend that shows signs of accelerating. In 2014, women had decision-making power over $11.2 trillion, or 39%, of the nation\u2019s estimated $28.6 trillion in investible assets, according to the Center for Talent Innovation. Not only do they earn more than they used to, but Morningstar notes that as baby boomers age, women likely will gain control of even more assets because they tend to outlive their male partners.\n\n\u201cAs women control more wealth, it is reasonable to expect to see more women among the fund managers investing those savings,\u201d Ms. Lutton says.\n\nShe and others argue that increasing the ranks of female fund managers would benefit all investors. Men are more likely to be overconfident investors, trade more (which results in fees and other trading costs that can erode returns) and follow the herd, says Meredith Jones, author of a new book that contends female money managers tend to favor investing approaches that allow them to generate higher returns.\n\nSuzanne Duncan, global head of research at State Street Center for Applied Research, says increased gender diversity could help shift the asset-management industry\u2019s focus from outperforming a peer or benchmark in the near term to long-term investment goals.\n\nA survey by the center of hundreds of investment professionals found that men and women approach investing in different, but complementary ways, with women more likely to measure success as achieving a long-term goal, she says.\n\nCreating opportunities\n\nWhen Pamela Wisehaupt Tynan, lead manager of the $12.3 billion Vanguard Short-Term Tax-Exempt Fund, volunteered to start an initiative at Vanguard to boost the ranks of its female leaders, she found that women were more cautious than men about going for jobs, believing they didn\u2019t meet the listed qualifications. Vanguard has since implemented programs to encourage more women to raise their hands, she says.\n\nThyra Zerhusen, founder of Fairpointe Capital, says it is in everyone\u2019s interest to promote women, noting that she brings something to the table that her younger male peers often don\u2019t: She is more focused on what can go wrong.\n\nMs. Maxey is a special writer for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-market-of-slimmer-pickings-1435091645", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Illustration: Stephen Webster for The Wall Street Journal\n\nAmericans are getting some tough news from investment advisers these days: U.S. stocks have risen so fast since the financial crisis that future gains are likely to be weaker.\n\nThe S&P 500 index, for example, has tripled from its 2009 low, which is great news. Through this year\u2019s first half, however, it was up only 0.20%.\n\nStocks around the world have gotten so expensive that many professional investors are in a quandary. \u201cIf someone dumped a boatload of cash on me and said \u2018Put this to work,\u2019 I would have a difficult time putting new money into the stock market,\u201d says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, which oversees $68 billion.\n\nSo, investors have been looking far afield for big gains. Some individuals are holding their noses and throwing money into unstable countries that promise big rewards along with the big risks. Few money managers would direct clients to any of these places, though, so many pros are chasing returns in Europe, Japan or developing Asia. Others have turned to less common investments, including hedge funds, master limited partnerships or real estate.\n\nIn the end, though, many money managers and analysts say, investors need to accept a hard truth: Future stock returns will be lower than they have been since 2009. To save enough for retirement, people need to rely less on expectations of double-digit market returns, and set more money aside.\n\n\u201cReturns will be positive but somewhat lower\u201d on average in coming years, says Lori Heinel, chief portfolio strategist at State Street Global Advisors, in Boston, which oversees $2.4 trillion.\n\nDiminishing returns\n\nMs. Heinel expects a 6% to 9% annual return for the S&P this year, including dividends, but David Kostin, chief U.S. stock strategist at Goldman Sachs, says investors should expect less.\n\nDavid Kostin of Goldman Sachs says he is skeptical of moving too much money abroad. Photo: Scott Eells/Bloomberg News\n\nMr. Kostin recently published a report projecting an average annual return of 5% over the next 10 years, with 46% of that coming from dividends. That is roughly half the 9% historical average return, without adjusting for inflation. Removing the effects of inflation, Mr. Kostin expects 3% a year, compared with 7% historically.\n\nHe arrives at his forecast by tracking the S&P 500\u2019s price compared with its companies\u2019 average earnings over the preceding 10-year period. He removes one-time write-offs from the financial crisis and other periods. This is similar to a method popularized by Nobel Prize-winning Yale economist Robert Shiller, although Mr. Shiller uses net profits rather than adjusted profits.\n\nForecasting short-term gains this way doesn\u2019t work well, because stocks can do almost anything in the short run. But looking out over a 10-year period, you can get a more reliable forecast of average gains, Mr. Kostin says.\n\nRight now, by this measure, the S&P 500 trades at about 23 times average operating earnings for the past 10 years, well above the historical average of 16. When stocks have been this expensive in the past, average returns over the following 10 years tended to group around 5% a year, without adjusting for inflation. Various predictors including the swaps market for dividends indicate that future dividends should represent 46% of that return, almost exactly their share over the past 25 years, Mr. Kostin says. That means annual price gains would average only 2.7%.\n\nA dividend oasis\n\nMr. Kostin doesn\u2019t expect stocks simply to plod ahead at a 2.7% pace (plus 2.3% in dividends). Usually, stocks jump to an unsustainable level, slump and rise again, and ups and downs like that could produce the 5% average annual return. Mr. Kostin recommends a long list of dividend-generating companies that he thinks will be able to keep expanding dividends even in a difficult economy, including stocks such as Cisco Systems Inc., Microsoft Corp. , Ford Motor Co. , International Business Machines Corp. , Verizon Communications Inc., Pfizer Inc., International Paper Co. , Valero Energy Corp. , Lockheed Martin Corp. and Regions Financial Corp.\n\nSome speculators are chasing returns in shaky places\u2014with dramatic effects. Driven by foreign investments, markets in some of the world\u2019s riskiest economies have been top performers so far this year.\n\nAmong markets that allow foreigners to invest, the biggest gainer in 2015\u2019s first half was Venezuela, up 233%, even though the autocratic oil producer is in severe economic trouble. Argentina was second, up 36%, despite defaulting on its foreign debt last year. Russia was fifth, ahead 19%, never mind that its economy is sagging under diminished oil prices and U.S. sanctions.\n\nMost money managers wouldn\u2019t go near this kind of risk. Mr. Kostin, for one, is skeptical of moving too much money abroad because of the cost of hedging currency risks and the overall dangers of overseas markets.\n\n\u2018We have been telling people for four years that they should expect slower economic growth [than before the financial crisis] and lower equity returns.\u2019 \u2014 Henry Herrmann , CEO at Waddell & Reed Financial\n\n\u201cThe return may be modest for the U.S. market relative to history, based on my forecast, but what are the opportunity sets elsewhere?\u201d Mr. Kostin says.\n\nOthers do recommend shifting some money to more-stable foreign markets. Anwiti Bahuguna, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, which manages $506 billion, examines foreign alternatives closely. Her firm was a big fan of Europe, but pulled back earlier this year because European stocks had risen sharply and the Greek controversy was looming. She remains a proponent of Asia and Japan in particular, but even there, stocks are getting pricey.\n\nOf 16 major global markets, only two look cheap, with price/earnings ratios below their medians of the past 10 years, based on earnings forecasts for the coming 12 months. Those are Greece and Russia. All the others, including the U.S., Japan, China, France, Germany, Britain and Italy, are expensive, most near their historical extremes.\n\nIf you look back 20 years, adding in the high P/E ratios from the bubble years of the late 1990s, Japan, China and Korea join Russia and Greece as cheaper than their medians. The rest are still more expensive.\n\n\u201cI would agree that returns are likely to be lower given where valuations are in the equity market,\u201d Ms. Bahuguna says. \u201cI\u2019m not expecting a very strong return.\u201d\n\nFor 2015, she says, she anticipates that the S&P 500 will rise 5% to 7%, including dividends.\n\nStocks on the shelf\n\nInstead of going abroad, many money managers are chasing domestic alternatives to stocks, but those come with their own problems.\n\nHedge funds have had trouble outgaining the S&P. Master limited partnerships can generate tax issues if you sell them. Real-estate investment trusts are expensive, and physical real estate requires management skills. If the Federal Reserve is right and the U.S. economy is improving, bond yields will rise, meaning bond prices will fall, making bonds a potentially losing investment.\n\nGiven all that, some experts have a simple piece of advice: Save more. The logic is simple. If your investments are going to be growing more slowly, the only way to reach your goal is to put more money in the pot.\n\nHenry Herrmann, chief executive officer at Waddell & Reed Financial Inc., which oversees $124 billion in Overland Park, Kan., says, \u201cWe have been telling people for four years that they should expect slower economic growth [than before the financial crisis] and lower equity returns.\u201d\n\nMr. Browning is a Wall Street Journal staff reporter.

Not only did the market shudder as China\u2019s economic problems persisted, but technical problems disrupted the trading of hundreds of U.S. mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Anticipation of a Federal Reserve interest-rate increase added to the unrest.\n\nIn the end, the damage was done to average stock-fund prices in August. But any stock-fund investor who ran for the hills during the worst of the declines may have regretted doing so, since the stock market recovered a good deal of its losses by month\u2019s end.\n\nThe average diversified U.S.-stock mutual fund posted a negative 5.6% return for August, according to data from Thomson Reuters Corp. \u2019s Lipper unit, wiping out the hard-fought 2015 gains heading into the month, and putting the year-to-date return at negative 2.5%.\n\nStill, despite market tumult, \u201cequity mutual-fund investors haven't exactly run for the exits,\u201d says Jeff Tjornehoj, head of Americas Research at Lipper. He saw a \u201cfairly mild\u201d outflow of $2.5 billion from stock funds for the week of Aug. 20-26 (weeks are measured through Wednesdays), when some of the worst declines hit.\n\nThat said, stock ETFs suffered $15.2 billion in outflows\u2014the fourth-highest ever for a week, and a figure that accounted for about 1.1% of equity ETF assets, says Mr. Tjornehoj. Where did that money go? A lot of it is responsible for the $46.9 billion surge to money-market funds for the month, the Lipper researcher says.\n\nGold-oriented funds were a lone bright spot during the unrest, with a 2.5% gain for the month, but are still one of the weakest sectors for the year so far, off about 21%.\n\nInternational-stock funds took a bigger tumble than U.S.-stock funds in August, falling 6.9%. But they are still outpacing U.S.-stock funds for the year to date, with a negative 0.8% return.\n\nBond funds were barely changed. The latest thinking on a Fed rate increase is that investors should expect one before the end of the year. Policy makers are still of the view that the U.S. jobs market is improving and economic output is expanding steadily and modestly, The Wall Street Journal reported, setting the stage for rates to rise again.\n\nBut if done deftly by the Fed, such an increase shouldn\u2019t hurt most stock or bond funds that much, analysts have said.\n\nBond funds focused on intermediate-maturity, investment-grade debt, the most commonly held type, had an average return of negative 0.4% in August, and remained up 0.1% for the year as August mercifully ended.\n\nMr. Power is a Wall Street Journal news editor in South Brunswick, N.J.

But they are especially so now, since market drops have suddenly rekindled investors\u2019 memories of bear markets.\n\nAfter several bracing declines for stocks, the question for investors now is: What should they expect when the next bear market comes along\u2014if it isn\u2019t already here? And how can they protect themselves?\n\nThe answer to the first question: Expect stocks to fall across the board. In other words, don\u2019t expect to avoid losses on investments in \u201cdefensive\u201d sectors of the market.\n\nThe answer to the second question: There might be some safety in gold and other commodities\u2014or there might not. The surest way to avoid losing money in a bear stock market is to invest in bonds.\n\nAll fall down\n\nTo gauge asset classes\u2019 likely performance during the next major stock-market decline, I analyzed all U.S. bear stock markets since the late 1920s. I relied on a list compiled by Ned Davis Research of Venice, Fla., according to which there have been 28 bear markets in that time.\n\nAlmost every stock-market sector has suffered in each of the bear markets of the past 90 years. This is the case even for categories that are widely believed to provide downside protection, such as international stocks, those of companies with the largest market capitalizations and so-called value stocks\u2014those trading for low prices relative to their book values.\n\nSome of those sectors might not fall as much as the broad market, but they are likely to fall. For example, compared with the S&P 500 index\u2019s 57% drop during the 2007-09 bear market, international stocks fell 61% (as measured by MSCI \u2019s EAFE Index, which stands for Europe, Australasia and the Far East). The 10% of stocks with the largest market caps fell 53%, while the 10% with the lowest price-to-book ratios fell 51%, according to data from Dartmouth College professor Kenneth R. French.\n\nThe asset class that has performed most consistently during bear markets is intermediate-term Treasury bonds. According to Morningstar data, intermediate-term Treasurys gained as a group during all but one of the 28 bear markets since 1929, and in the one bear market where they didn\u2019t they still lost less than 1%.\n\nThe interest-rate threat\n\nSome investors may be reluctant to rely on bonds for protection, despite the historical record, out of fear that bond prices will drop as interest rates rise from their current levels near record lows.\n\nClaude Erb says bond funds are fine even if the Fed raises rates in a bear market. Photo: TCW Group\n\nBut even if the Federal Reserve were to raise rates during the next stock bear market, which seems doubtful, bond funds, especially those investing in U.S. Treasurys, wouldn\u2019t suffer as much as investors might fear, according to Claude Erb, a former fixed-income manager at mutual-fund firm TCW Group. One reason, he says, is the tendency of many investors to load up on Treasurys as a safe harbor when things look particularly grim on Wall Street, which lends support to the bonds\u2019 prices.\n\nAnother, Mr. Erb says, is that bond funds are able to reinvest interest income and the proceeds of maturing bonds in new ones with higher yields\u2014which at least partially offsets any losses from declines in bond prices.\n\nIt is worth noting that interest rates rose in half of the bear markets since 1929, and this still didn\u2019t prevent intermediate-term bonds from consistently producing a profit.\n\nDoubleLine Total Return Bond (DLTNX) and Vanguard Short-Term Investment-Grade (VFSTX) are the funds in this asset class that are currently recommended by the most advisers monitored by the Hulbert Financial Digest whose model portfolios have beaten the stock market over the past 15 years (through Aug. 31, as measured by the Wilshire 5000 index). The DoubleLine fund is slightly riskier than the Vanguard offering, currently holding bonds with an average maturity of 5.9 years, according to Morningstar\u2014versus 3.1 years for the Vanguard fund. The DoubleLine fund yields 3.6% and has a 0.72% expense ratio, or $7.20 annually per $1,000 invested, while the Vanguard fund yields 1.8% and has a 0.20% expense ratio.\n\nCommodities go both ways\n\nCommodities have also performed creditably during past stock bear markets, though far less consistently than bonds. During U.S. stock bear markets of the past three decades, for example, the S&P GSCI Index, a commodity benchmark, has fallen just as often as it has risen.\n\nDuring the latest bear market, for example, the GSCI fell 48%, nearly as much as the S&P 500\u2019s 57% drop.\n\nThe same overall conclusion applies to gold, which is part of the S&P GSCI index but is considered by some to be a separate asset class. Though it gained ground during the latest bear market for stocks, it also has fallen as often as it has risen during bear markets of the past three decades.\n\nTo be sure, a 50% probability of loss is far better than the near certainty that applies to different sectors of the stock market. The most popular commodity-oriented funds currently among the advisers who have beaten the stock market over the past 15 years are PowerShares DB Agriculture ETF (DBA), which invests in 10 widely traded agriculture commodities, and SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which invests in gold bullion. These two ETFs have expense ratios of 0.85% and 0.40%, respectively.\n\nFactor in the cost\n\nAllocating part of a portfolio to bonds and commodities does carry a cost, since these assets typically don\u2019t fully participate in stocks\u2019 bull markets. As with any insurance policy, an investor must be willing to forgo performance when things are going well in order to reduce losses when conditions deteriorate.\n\nInvestors looking for protection must also be willing to forgo performance when things are going well. Photo: iStock/Getty Images\n\nThe appropriate allocation for any individual\u2019s portfolio will depend on that person\u2019s risk tolerance and confidence in being able to predict when the next bear market will begin.\n\nAmong the 15-year market beaters, the average current allocation to fixed income in a model portfolio is 25%, with an additional 5% invested in commodities or other tangible assets.\n\nMr. Hulbert is a columnist at MarketWatch and editor of Hulbert Financial Digest.

Photo: Peter Ross for The Wall Street Journal\n\nVisitors to Fred Alger Management Inc. in New York are greeted by a wall of 35 small oil paintings of candles, each delicately set on a wooden panel. The artwork is a memorial to the employees the company lost on 9/11.\n\nEach soft flame\u2014vulnerable, but nonetheless constant\u2014could also serve as a testament to the firm\u2019s ability to endure.\n\nThe terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, killed 35 of the roughly 40 employees then assigned to the investment-advisory firm\u2019s offices on the 93rd floor of the World Trade Center\u2019s North Tower. They included David Alger, who was president of the firm and the younger brother of founder Fred Alger, and most of the investment-management team.\n\nFourteen years later, Alger is thriving in sunny, loft-like offices across town on New York City\u2019s East Side. It is no accident, though, that the space\u2014dedicated to the memory of its lost colleagues\u2014is on the second floor.\n\n\u201cFor obvious reasons, I never want to be on a high floor again,\u201d says Chief Executive Daniel Chung, who in 2001 was a 39-year-old technology-stock analyst attending a midtown meeting on the morning of the attack.\n\nExpansion challenge\n\nAlger has proved its mettle and investment skill in the intervening years. It manages more than $24 billion, up from about $13.6 billion at the end of 2001, and its fund lineup has expanded to 17 mutual funds and 14 institutional strategies, up from just 10 mutual funds at the time of the attack.\n\nThe firm, a unit of brokerage firm Fred Alger & Co., which was founded in 1964, has maintained a focus on growth stocks. The investment philosophy, set out by Fred Alger, uses fundamental research to identify companies that are experiencing positive changes such as high unit-volume growth, new management, an acquisition or product innovation. Fred Alger, who retired in 1995, returned to Alger immediately after the attacks to help start its rebuilding. He named Mr. Chung chief investment officer.\n\nUnder Mr. Chung, Fred Alger\u2019s son-in-law, the firm embraced change. Mr. Chung, who had joined the firm in 1994, became its president in 2003 and chief executive in 2006.\n\nAlong the way, in 2004, the company started its first international fund, and now offers three international strategies with a combined $302 million in assets as of June 30. In 2008, it launched a hedge-fund-like strategy that now has about $200 million in assets. In 2014, the firm opened a London office to handle overseas sales and client service. And earlier this year, the company joined with La Fran\u00e7aise Group, a French asset-management company, to distribute its products in Europe.\n\nAlger now employs 160 people, 45 of whom are investment professionals, compared with about 215 employees, including 19 investment professionals, at the end of 2001.\n\n\u2018We proved them wrong\u2019\n\nMr. Chung says he\u2019s proud of where the firm stands.\n\n\u201cPart of that is what we had to go through,\u201d he says. \u201cMany said we wouldn\u2019t be relevant. We proved them wrong.\u201d\n\nThe 35 small oil paintings by artist Patrick Jewell are accompanied on the wall at Alger by the list of the 35 victims. Photo: Peter Ross for The Wall Street Journal; Painting by Patrick Jewell\n\nAfter 9/11 hit, seven alumni returned from other jobs or retirement to help rebuild the money manager. A handful of them remain. Among them are Jill Greenwald, a small-cap specialist who left J.W. Seligman and Chase Vista funds to return and who is now a portfolio manager; Steve Thumm, who left a job at a hedge fund and who is senior vice president, head of equity trading and a portfolio manager; and Theresa McRoberts, who left a hedge fund where she was a partner and heads Alger\u2019s health-care team.\n\n\u201cI knew they could help me teach the next generation how to invest the old way, and they have,\u201d says Mr. Chung.\n\nThe road to recovery hasn't all been smooth. Fred Alger Management and Fred Alger & Co. agreed to pay $40 million in 2007 as part of the fund industry\u2019s \u201cmarket timing\u201d scandal. The two companies settled charges that they permitted investors to make short-term trades and permitted late trading in certain funds advised by Fred Alger Management.\n\n\u201cWe decided to move past it rather than to continue to fight it,\u201d says Mr. Chung.\n\nIf any question lingers over the firm today, it is whether Alger can successfully expand its investment-management talent.\n\nA key element in Alger\u2019s growth has been Patrick Kelly. Just 26 at the time of the 9/11 attack, he was promoted to portfolio manager in 2004 with no portfolio-management experience. He now manages or co-manages more than 70% of the firm\u2019s assets, including its flagship $5.1 billion Alger Spectra Fund and its $2.4 billion Alger Capital Appreciation Fund.\n\nMr. Kelly stepped into big shoes. The Spectra fund was run by David Alger at the time of his death, and was one of the most successful funds of the 1990s, says Alec Lucas, an analyst covering equity strategies at Morningstar Inc.\n\nBut Mr. Kelly has steered the assets impressively, Mr. Lucas says.\n\nOver the 10 years through August, Spectra ranks first in its large-cap-growth category, while Capital Appreciation\u2019s A shares rank 10th in the category, according to Morningstar.\n\nLooking for other stars\n\nThe firm\u2019s other funds don\u2019t have quite as impressive a record, Mr. Lucas says. Through July, all of the Alger funds to which Morningstar awards its highest rankings of four or five stars were managed by Mr. Kelly with the exception of Alger Emerging Markets Fund.\n\nWhile Mr. Kelly\u2019s level of success is difficult to reach, says Mr. Lucas, the question is: Can the firm find other managers who can prove they can outperform in a market cycle?\n\nTodd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual-fund research at S&P Capital IQ, says that Alger is trying to diversify and to reduce its dependency on one executive. Such a danger is known as \u201ckey-person\u201d risk, Mr. Rosenbluth says.\n\n\u201cNo firm better understands the impact of that than this firm that lost people in that tragic terrorist event,\u201d he says.\n\nMs. Maxey is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Google\n\nWhen it comes to advances in technology, young adults are often the first to embrace change. But it\u2019s the 50-plus crowd that could end up as early adopters of a coming revolution in transportation: self-driving cars.\n\nMost major auto makers already are testing such vehicles. In May, Google, the Mountain View, Calif., search giant, which has pioneered the self-driving idea, unveiled its latest prototype car\u2014with no steering wheel, and no accelerator or brake pedals.\n\nWe recently visited with Brad Templeton, who consulted on the Google car team in 2011 and 2012 and now teaches at Singularity University in Silicon Valley. He noted that self-driving vehicles still face significant regulatory hurdles (think: liability and insurance).\n\nBut some major areas, he says, could see \u201crobocars\u201d (his preferred word) in wide use by 2020 or so\u2014and older adults, in particular, may reap the early benefits.\n\n\u201cThe realities of life just take mobility away from people as they get older,\u201d Mr. Templeton says. \u201cA solution to that problem is going to be highly welcomed.\u201d\n\nHere are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nGoing Places\n\nWSJ: When do you think riding in an automated vehicle will become a reality?\n\nMR. TEMPLETON: Actually pretty soon, but over a limited area. If it\u2019s Google, one can imagine they would start in Mountain View, Calif., or San Francisco. Ford might start in Ann Arbor, Mich. It is also a good natural fit for a retirement community.\n\nWSJ: So having these cars operate in closed communities will get people used to the idea?\n\nMR. TEMPLETON: That\u2019s right. It might handle only some of the streets, but wouldn\u2019t be forced into preprogrammed routes. It would take you where you wanted to go. That could happen fairly quickly\u2014this decade.\n\nSuburban Survival\n\nWSJ: Why might older adults be early adopters of the self-driving car?\n\nMR. TEMPLETON: Because I don\u2019t think anyone wants to be a shut-in.\n\nThe boomers all moved to the suburbs, and the suburbs don\u2019t have good transit. When boomers get to be seniors, they will find themselves without as much driving ability and without the ability to use transit to get places.\n\nSometimes the only alternative will be to move out of your house. If [a self-driving car] lets you keep your house rather than having to move, I think you\u2019ll see people who aren\u2019t necessarily early adopters go for it.\n\nWSJ: How will this car be sold to people?\n\nMR. TEMPLETON: You might sell it to people for a monthly fee. Plus they would have to pay per mile for gasoline, and to some extent, insurance and maintenance.\n\nYou also can sell this per mile like a taxi, except it would be much cheaper because 60% of the cost of running a taxi is the driver. It will basically be a cheap Uber [which allows a person to hail a private car or ride-share from a mobile phone], and with no need to talk to the driver.\n\nWSJ: If autonomous cars operated using a service model, as opposed to ownership, what will people pay per ride?\n\nMR. TEMPLETON: It will start somewhere between 50 cents and a buck per mile. I think it could even get [to be] less than 50 cents a mile, but it won\u2019t start cheaper.\n\nFor people who are going to make light use of it, then the per-mile price, rather than the monthly price, might actually be a good thing. Seniors stop buying cars because they don\u2019t really feel like trading in anymore, and they cut their mileage by quite a bit.\n\nNot a Car\n\nWSJ: Looking further down the road, what might we see in the self-driving market?\n\nMR. TEMPLETON: I think eventually people will build sleeper cars that can do an overnight trip. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a very green vision, but you would probably be able to hire a car that doesn\u2019t even have seats. It\u2019s just got a bed. Get into it, lie down, and then eight hours later you wake up and you\u2019re 400-500 miles away.\n\nWSJ: What would you call a self-driving vehicle?\n\nMR. TEMPLETON: Robocar was the name I picked because when you say it, everyone knows what it is.\n\n\u201cDriverless car\u201d is my least favorite. I tell people that\u2019s like saying \u201chorseless carriage.\u201d So 100 years ago, the only thing people noticed was: Hey, there\u2019s no horse. In fact, the first horseless carriages looked like carriages with no horse. Later they realized, wait, we don\u2019t have to design this like an old carriage.\n\nI think the same is true here, and in fact, Google has kind of shown that. Version 1 was a Prius, and Version 2 was a Lexus SUV. This [latest] one is designed from the ground up. This isn\u2019t a car. It is the thing that comes after a car, as the car came after the horse.\n\nThe fact that there isn\u2019t a person driving it eventually will be the least important thing about it.\n\nMs. Hedli is a writer in California. She can be reached at encore@wsj.com.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nBrad Templeton believes that self-driving cars could be in wide use as early as the 2020s and that rides in self-driving cars could cost about 50 cents per mile.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-search-of-low-volatility-investments-1441764462", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Illustration: Guy Billout for The Wall Street Journal\n\nFor stock-market investors who want to sleep better at night, the fund industry has a solution: low-volatility funds and ETFs. The idea behind these investments is an equity strategy that aims to capture reasonable returns with less risk.\n\nBut before tucking such funds into a portfolio and heading off to bed, investors need to understand not only the benefits but the limitations of these products.\n\nFor example, low-vol funds can offer great downside protection, says Farris Shuggi, an analyst at mutual-fund company T. Rowe Price Group Inc. But typically, Mr. Shuggi adds, whenever stocks go into rally mode, \u201cthese strategies are going to underperform.\u201d\n\nStrong demand from anxious investors has led investment firms to roll out more than 20 low-vol stock funds and exchange-traded funds since 2011. These funds and ETFs aim to tame volatility by buying stock in only financially strong companies whose share prices tend to move much less than broad market indexes.\n\nStudies suggest that such stocks can deliver better risk-adjusted returns over time than more speculative stocks\u2014and that has certainly been the case during the recent market correction. In August, the iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF (USMV), the largest of its genre, shed about 4.5% while the S&P 500 index was down more than 6%.\n\nBut China-driven market disruptions notwithstanding, this might not be an ideal time to rush into a low-vol fund, says Morningstar Inc. analyst Michael Rawson. People who think stocks are in for a much bigger decline might be better off going to cash, Mr. Rawson says, while those who expect the rally to resume would fare better with somewhat more aggressive equity strategies.\n\nHere are some important things to understand about low-volatility funds.\n\nThe benefit is relative\n\nStudies suggest that low-vol stocks deliver better risk-adjusted returns. However, the returns of purely low-volatility portfolios stand out less when compared with returns of moderately volatile stocks, according to research by University of Rochester professor Robert Novy-Marx.\n\nIn an analysis last year, Prof. Novy-Marx found that in a 45-year span ended in 2013, moderately volatile stocks performed fairly similarly to stocks with the lowest volatility\u2014and significantly better than the most volatile stocks. A key reason is that the most volatile stocks often are those of unprofitable companies classified as \u201csmall growth\u201d stocks. In \u201clarge cap value,\u201d the study added, aggressive stocks actually outpaced more-defensive issues.\n\nJoseph Flaherty, chief investment-risk officer of Boston-based MFS Investment Management, counsels long-term investors to own a mix of low- and moderate-volatility stocks\u2014providing the latter are financially strong companies with positive earnings momentum and attractively priced shares.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less about concentrating on low volatility and more about avoiding high volatility,\u201d he says.\n\nLow-vol funds might face headwinds\n\nAlthough market volatility may continue, funds that specifically aim for lower volatility might deliver weaker performances than in the past, some analysts believe. One concern centers around valuations, which have risen a lot because of strong inflows into low-vol funds. Morningstar estimates that more than $6 billion has flowed into low-vol equity ETFs in about the past year.\n\nIs low volatility the goal? Or just avoiding high volatility? Photo: iStock/Getty Images\n\nTheir valuations looked even less compelling after the August market meltdown, says Mr. Rawson. Around the month\u2019s lows, the S&P 500 index had fallen to about 86% of what Morningstar calculates as fair market value. The iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF, because it held up relatively better, stood at about 92% of fair market value at that point, thus trading at a smaller discount.\n\nIn the longer term, low-vol stocks also may eventually face competition from rising bond yields, says Morningstar analyst Alex Bryan. Low-vol funds tend to own companies with stable cash flow. Those are comparatively more rate-sensitive than, say, cyclical stocks, whose cash flows would swell in an expanding economy, offsetting the impact of rising rates.\n\nStrategic is preferable to tactical\n\nIt is tempting to jump into low-volatility funds whenever a market downturn seems imminent. But most nonprofessional investors would fare better by taking a buy-and-hold approach, fund managers say.\n\nMoving tactically in and out of funds is a form of market timing\u2014a practice that frequently trips up individuals. Moreover, there could be benefits to making low-volatility shares a permanent part of a portfolio.\n\nBecause low-vol strategies moderate downside moves, an investor who uses them as part of a broader portfolio could boost exposure to stocks without taking a lot more risk, says Paul Zemsky, who oversees multiasset strategies at the investment arm of Voya Financial Inc. For example, he says, a person who might otherwise hold 50% in stocks could boost that to 60% using a low-vol strategy and still not lose sleep.\n\nOther ways to damp volatility\n\nIn a strengthening economy, if stocks rally, low-vol stocks might provide better risk-adjusted returns than bonds. But people who don\u2019t own at least some bonds are reducing diversification, says John Rafal, founder and vice-chair at the Connecticut-based advisory firm Essex Financial Services.\n\nMr. Rafal calculates that in the two decades ended last year, a 60%-40% stock-bond mix would have produced average annual gains of about 9%\u2014less than the 11.7% annual return for an all-stock portfolio over the same period. But the stock-bond mix would have had about half as much volatility, he says.\n\nAnother traditional investment strategy\u2014focusing on stocks with consistently rising dividends\u2014also can reduce volatility, says James Norman, who heads QS Batterymarch Financial Management Inc. The firm uses that approach in Legg Mason\u2019s QS Batterymarch Global Dividend fund (LMQSX), which it subadvises.\n\nLow-vol ETFs\u2019 rate risk\n\nPowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV), with some $4.7 billion in assets, is a suitable core holding for conservative investors, a Morningstar analysis says. Like its iShares peer, SPLV beat the S&P 500 in August, declining about 5%, or about one percentage point less than the broad index.\n\nStill, some investors worry about its rate sensitivity. The fund tracks the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index, which is rebalanced quarterly and holds the 100 stocks in the S&P 500 with the lowest volatility in the prior 12 months. At times, that has included a hefty portion of rate-sensitive utilities, although that allocation recently has fallen significantly.\n\nRiverFront Investment Group, in Richmond, Va., has switched from SPLV to PowerShares S&P 500 ex-Rate Sensitive Low Volatility Portfolio (XRLV), which is similar, but excludes stocks that fare poorly in rising-rate periods, says Peter Quinn, president and chief operating officer of RiverFront.\n\nSPLV doesn\u2019t have constraints on allocations, so the rate-sensitive portion of its portfolio could increase again over time, says John Feyerer, director of equity product research at Invesco PowerShares.

And that has fueled the debate over how these funds should adjust the balance between stocks and other investments in their portfolios as they approach their target date\u2014a balance many fund providers have tinkered with in the past couple of years.\n\nThe upshot for investors: They should understand that funds with the same target date don\u2019t all have the same exposure to stocks, so some funds might suit their risk tolerance more than others.\n\nBumpy landing?\n\nTarget-date retirement funds, by design, own a heftier portion of stocks early in people\u2019s working lives, when they can most easily tolerate an occasional year of poor returns. The funds then automatically trim stock exposure in later years, aiming to smooth the ride as investors near retirement\u2014and beyond, for those who keep money in these funds after the target date.\n\nBut with markets off this year, holders of many 2015-dated funds (geared for those expecting to retire around this time) are in danger of a bumpy landing. Their average return for 2015 was about minus 2.9% as of Sept. 30, according to Morningstar Inc. Some were down more than 4%, about the percentage of assets many people withdraw each year in retirement.\n\nSuch declines might be less worrisome to anyone focused on the longer term. Still, it is worth looking at what is behind them, says Morningstar analyst Jeff Holt. \u201cThese periods of market stress provide a test of whether strategies are holding up as designed.\u201d\n\nWith around $1 trillion in assets, target-date funds have become a key way for people in defined-contribution plans to save for retirement. Yet there is little consensus about how to design the downward trajectory of the equity holdings\u2014the so-called glide path.\n\nRon Surz, a retirement-plan consultant in San Clemente, Calif., argues that funds should have zero stocks at the retirement date. He says research shows most people take their money out of their accounts then, which justifies an ultraconservative glide path.\n\nOthers say such an approach could prove disastrous. People who don\u2019t have a significant holding of stocks well into retirement stand to lose a lot of purchasing power, says Fran Kinniry, principal in the investment strategy group at Vanguard Group, whose $210 billion in target-date assets are the most in the industry. \u201cCompound that out for 20 years, and you are in really bad shape,\u201d he says.\n\nBoth sides of that discussion are reflected in the design changes some fund providers have made in recent years. Fidelity Investments, whose funds trailed those of some peers as stocks rallied after the financial crisis, increased their equity allocations two years ago. Fidelity\u2019s 2015 fund now has about 55% of its portfolio in stocks, about five percentage points more than before the changes. That\u2019s similar to T. Rowe Price Group Inc. \u2019s flagship 2015 product and modestly higher than Vanguard\u2019s.\n\nShould target-date funds have zero stocks at the retirement date? Not everyone agrees. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nMathew Jensen, director of target-date funds at Fidelity, says the higher equity allocations are aimed at helping investors maintain their living standards through retirement. \u201cWhen you think about longevity for someone who is 65, they could be living to their early 90s,\u201d he says. \u201cThe way individuals are saving today,\u201d he says, meaning not enough, \u201cand the income they need from retirement, they need the power of equities.\u201d\n\nOthers have gone the opposite way. Capital Group, whose American Funds rank fifth with $34 billion in target-date assets, reduced equity allocations in funds closest to their retirement dates by about 10 percentage points after the financial crisis, says Rich Lang, vice president of its target-date retirement series. Its 2015 fund is 47% equity now.\n\nCapital Group further softened the landing of its target funds by shifting the equity mix to include more dividend-paying stocks, which tend to be less volatile than other shares, as the funds approach their target date.\n\nChange is good?\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of target-date series that have made changes to their series, increasing equity allocations to focus a bit more on longevity risk,\u201d Mr. Lang says. But that may give short shrift to market risk, he says. \u201cA target-date series should really try to address both\u201d types of risk, he says, and that was the aim of the adjustments at American.\n\nT. Rowe covers both sides of the debate. While its original target-date series still has one of the industry\u2019s highest equity allocations, the firm has introduced a new fund series with an equity allocation that drops to a more conservative 42.5% at the target date, when it\u2019s assumed holders will be about 65. The 2015 fund in that newer series, T. Rowe Price Target Retirement 2015 (TRRTX), was down 2.4% this year as of Sept. 30, compared with a drop of about 3.1% for its older counterpart.\n\nThe new series was designed to accommodate the risk tolerances of people who want to focus more on stability of principal than on maximizing their potential account balances at retirement, perhaps because they plan to take a lump-sum withdrawal at the target date, says Jerome Clark, who oversees target-date funds at the firm and helped create its first target-date series.\n\nHe says it is unlikely that employers who use T. Rowe products will offer both series in defined-contribution plans.\n\nHe adds that analysis of market returns over nearly 90 years concluded that the higher equity allocation used in T. Rowe\u2019s older series tends to produce the best retirement outcomes, enabling investors\u2019 holdings to recover quicker after market reversals.\n\nMr. Clark counsels investors not to overreact to this year\u2019s market. \u201cWhat matters most in the end isn\u2019t these short-term market environments\u2014it\u2019s the multiyear outcomes over the long term,\u201d he says.\n\nMorningstar\u2019s Mr. Holt says investors who are anxious about this year\u2019s returns should recall that more-conservative funds lagged behind peers not long ago, when stocks were booming. \u201cThere are a wide range of glide paths and approaches,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut there\u2019s no one glide path that is right for everyone.\u201d\n\nMr. Pollock is a writer in Ridgewood, N.J.

Previewed by SEC Chairman Mary Jo White in December, the series of moves is similar to what happened to banks after the 2008 crisis.\n\nWhat does it all mean? More costs for fund companies, warn some analysts. There might even be required \u201cstress tests\u201d for funds, like the banks undergo. But in theory, it\u2019s more protection for investors. Here\u2019s a guide.\n\nWhat has happened so far? The first rules, proposed in May, would make fund firms give up more data on their holdings, such as potentially risky derivatives products. Then last month came proposals requiring funds to prove they can handle the roof caving in. The funds would have to set up programs to classify \u201cliquidity risks\u201d for each of their trading positions. ETFs and exchange-traded managed funds, the hybrids that have been approved by the SEC but not yet launched, will also have to do it, but not money-market funds.\n\nWhat spurred this? Politicians, policy makers and industry participants questioned if funds are vulnerable to stresses that could destabilize the financial system. Funds are using more-complex strategies, focusing on asset classes that might take time to sell.\n\nHow would the proposed programs manage funds\u2019 liquidity risks? It gets pretty specific. For example, funds would be required to classify the liquidity of each of their holdings into one of six liquidity categories. The categories would indicate the number of days in which a holding or a portion of a holding could be sold at a price that wouldn\u2019t move the asset\u2019s price in the market. Funds would also be prohibited from acquiring any asset that couldn\u2019t be sold within seven calendar days if it would mean that such assets would account for more than 15% of their net assets.\n\nFunds would be required to invest a minimum percentage of their net assets in positions that could be converted to cash in three business days.\n\nFunds with illiquid assets will incur more rules-compliance costs. And the downside of carrying more \u201cliquid\u201d assets is that they could be easier to trade but produce weaker investment results, Moody\u2019s Investors Service warned.\n\nDo fairer costs result? Ideally. The rules permit mutual funds, except money funds and ETFs, to voluntarily use European-style \u201cswing pricing.\u201d That adjusts the net asset value of a fund\u2019s shares to pass on more trading costs to the shareholders responsible for that activity. The flexible pricing would be good for some fund companies and the funds\u2019 long-term performance, Moody\u2019s says.\n\nHow have the funds reacted? The Investment Company Institute trade group has said it supports the SEC on addressing risks. After the new proposal, however, it pointedly noted that mutual funds have successfully done this \u201cfor 75 years.\u201d\n\nDave Nadig, director of ETF research at FactSet, says it will be complex for some funds to meet the seven-day liquidity test. \u201cFolks in the ETF industry are shaking their heads trying to figure out how they\u2019re going to stay in the junk-bond ETF business if these proposals are put in place without modification,\u201d he says. Interestingly, small funds might be better off, since they have smaller positions to sell.\n\nWhat other regulatory changes might affect the asset-management business? Aside from annual stress tests, the SEC might require asset-management firms to detail how they could be dismantled in a crisis.\n\nHow will the rules proceed from here? Here is a link to the most recent 415-page proposed rule at sec.gov. Investors can weigh in with comments. Regulators have also reopened the comment period for new forms it has proposed; here is that link on the website.\n\nMs. Maxey is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

There were fewer 401(k) plans, no Roth options, etc.,\u201d says Lee Martin, a certified financial planner with Bellevue, Wash.-based TRUEretirement, whose clients tend to be in retirement or within 10 years of it. \u201cBut chances for regret have skyrocketed with all the choices out there.\u201d\n\nHere, then, are some of the biggest financial-planning issues that advisers say investors nearing retirement should consider:\n\n1. Understand revocable versus irrevocable choices\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any more basic, or important, than this: Spend the most brainpower on the financial choices that can\u2019t be reversed.\n\nMr. Martin coaches his clients to distinguish between choices that are revocable (or changeable) and those that aren\u2019t. Starting Social Security withdrawals is mostly irrevocable, as are certain decisions about how to draw pension income.\n\nOn the pension front, employers will ask workers before they retire to elect whether to take pension funds in a lump sum or in the form of monthly payments. Once they choose, workers can\u2019t revert to the other option.\n\nDepending on the role the pension assets play in a retiree\u2019s income mix, different choices make different sense, Mr. Martin says. Those concerned about outliving their assets might like the reliable monthly payment for life, whereas those who want to place the assets in a different part of their portfolio often elect the lump sum.\n\n\u201cThe question [investors have] to ask themselves in this instance is, \u2018Can I do a better job managing the pension funds myself?\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cThose who take the lump sum often move it into an IRA.\u201d\n\nAlso irrevocable: some housing decisions. Choosing to live in certain senior living environments, such as continuing-care retirement communities, can also lead to irrevocable financial outlays, in the form of typically six-figure nonrefundable down payments for entry.\n\n2. Spend some of it now, and stay liquid\n\nSpend some extra money right before you retire?\n\nThat might sound like bad advice to some, but experts say it makes sense for many preretirees.\n\nWEEDING OUT STOCKS | Many adults will enter retirement during a bear market. Photo: Philippe Huguen//Getty Images\n\nCash flow in retirement takes the form of \u201cspending down\u201d saved assets, rather than accumulating and increasing income. Planners and clients can\u2019t foretell life expectancy or the future cost of health problems or inflation, so income preservation and cash flow must be managed carefully.\n\nWith that in mind, preretirees should consider springing for needed repairs or purchases while they are still earning money, says Timothy Gagnon, a certified public accountant and tax lawyer who is a professor at Northeastern University.\n\n\u201cPeople need to look at their home, their roof, their car, and replace or repair anything that needs attention before they retire, preferably during the three to five years prior to retiring,\u201d says Mr. Gagnon. \u201cYou don\u2019t want big hits to cash flow once retirement begins.\u201d\n\nDuring the early years of retirement, many people follow the conventional wisdom of dipping just a small toe into their resources, while waiting to tap income streams such as Social Security or retirement-account withdrawals in the hopes that their payouts or portfolios will grow.\n\nThat isn\u2019t a bad idea, but near-retirees\u2014even if they\u2019ve pared back their stock exposure\u2014also need to consider what might happen in the market around the time they retire. Many adults will enter retirement during a bear market, says Christine Benz, director of personal finance at investment-research firm Morningstar Inc.\n\n\u201cThe risk is that you might wind up pulling out a larger percentage payment of your portfolio while making withdrawals in a market where prices are down,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that at the bottom of the market.\u201d\n\nTo safeguard against that scenario, she recommends what is known as a \u201cbucket strategy,\u201d where investors keep a layer of liquid reserves so they don\u2019t have to sell shares in a down market.\n\nAdvisers interpret and implement bucket strategies in several ways, but the general idea, she says, is that you maintain a level of cash reserves so that you can \u201cstay flexible if income from distributions is low,\u201d tapping reserves rather than eating into equities to get needed income.\n\n3. The taxman looms, so be sure to diversify\n\nFor those with traditional retirement accounts (a 401(k), non-Roth IRA, etc.), Uncle Sam will make sure you start taking some of your winnings off the table. But you and your adviser have to keep on top of the tax implications\u2014and it\u2019s best to do this before you start taking so-called required minimum distributions (RMDs, for short) at age 70\u00bd.\n\nRMDs are taxed as ordinary income. Retirees should understand what their total income and tax bracket will be both before and after RMDs commence, and that they are responsible for setting aside funds to pay taxes.\n\n\u2018Thirty or 40 years ago, there was nothing to regret [in retirement choices].... But chances for regret have skyrocketed with all the choices out there.\u2019 \u2014Financial planner Lee Martin\n\nAt the same time RMDs kick in, retirees also lose beloved maneuvers\u2014such as making pretax contributions to retirement accounts\u2014commonly used to lower taxable income.\n\nThose who own their homes outright have already lost their mortgage-interest tax deduction, while those who no longer work may lose deductions such as a home office.\n\n\u201cTax diversification isn\u2019t brought up as much as it should be. If you wait until you start drawing income, it\u2019s too late,\u201d says Joe Sicchitano, a senior vice president and head of wealth planning at SunTrust Bank, which in 2014 began offering clients a retirement tool, called SummitView, to look at all their assets in one place and model retirement scenarios. \u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily need to change underlying investments, just the vehicle [containing them].\u201d\n\nMs. Benz says adults between 63 and 70\u00bd \u201cstill have a lot of control over their income,\u201d whether or not they\u2019ve retired, and can take steps to offset a looming tax hit.\n\nThese include a Roth conversion (which will also have tax consequences, albeit different ones) or moving some funds into brokerage accounts, so they remain in the market but in a vehicle where withdrawals are taxed at capital-gains rates versus ordinary income-tax rates.\n\n4. Know your benefits and how choices affect heirs\n\nOne of the wisest things preretirees can do is double-check the fine print in their employers\u2019 401(k), pension or other benefit plans, as well as the fine print connected to any annuity choices they are considering.\n\nFor example, higher earners often find that their employers offer not only a 401(k) plan but also a \u201cnonqualified deferred compensation,\u201d or NQDC, package. Since the dollar amount against which an employer can make a 401(k) match is currently capped at $265,000 (under compensation limitations announced each year by the Internal Revenue Service), some employers paying higher earners north of this amount recognize a match on the overage through an NQDC plan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen these plans crop up at a lot of the local drug companies,\u201d says Ann Minnium, a fee-only adviser with Concierge Financial Planning in Scotch Plains, N.J. \u201cMost people think that this is part of their 401(k), but it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMs. Minnium says NQDC plans often begin paying employees at age 55, at retirement, or within a five- to 10-year window past age 55. Employees need to vet how their plan works to put the money to work in the most sensible way.\n\nPreretirees also should consider choices for using annuity and pension plans. The plans often require a choice between withdrawals in the form of a \u201cstraight life\u201d income stream or over a multiyear term (10 years, 20 years, etc.), says Mr. Martin.\n\nIn the straight-life scenario, people get the maximum allowable monthly payment for the rest of their lives\u2014so they can\u2019t outlive income from the annuity. When they die, however, their spouse and heirs get nothing, which turns this into a bad bet if the investor dies soon after payments begin.\n\nIn a multiyear term, investors receive the annuity payments monthly for the duration of the term they choose\u2014but if they die before the term ends, their heirs get the payments for the duration of the term.\n\nThe overall lesson: All retirement planning strives to provide a mix of resources for enjoying life, alongside resources that can cover unforeseen costs and events, plus expectations about inflation.\n\nMr. Martin puts it this way: \u201cThere are a lot of levers you can control.\u201d\n\nMs. Hodges is a writer in Seattle.

But about 5% of them morph into something more serious\u2014sinus infections, bronchitis or pneumonia\u2014and people 65 and older are particularly susceptible to that threat, says William Schaffner, an infectious-disease specialist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tenn. Flu, meanwhile, puts thousands of people in the hospital each year.\n\nYour best defense starts with diligent hand-washing and a flu shot. But studies suggest that there are additional steps you can take to stay free of respiratory illnesses, or at least make a speedier recovery. Here are some of those steps.\n\nStrike a Pose\n\nPracticing so-called mindfulness meditation\u2014a combination of gentle yoga and meditation\u2014for eight weeks reduced the incidence, intensity and duration of cold and flu symptoms by 40% to 50% among a group of people over age 50, compared with people in a control group who didn't meditate, researchers at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison, Wis., found.\n\nA group of older adults who engaged in moderate exercise over the study period reduced symptoms by 30% to 40%, compared with the control group.\n\nA recent study at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., also found immune benefits for mind-body therapies, especially tai chi and qi gong, two centuries-old practices merging movement and meditation.\n\nExercise\u2026Your Vocal Cords\n\nJapanese researchers recently tested this strategy by taking blood and saliva samples from a group of people over age 60 before and after a singing exercise.\n\nLevels of stress-related hormones like cortisol dropped after study participants belted out a song, while levels of immunoglobulin A, a substance that deflects viruses and bacteria, rose\u2014both evidence of a stronger immune system. Consider joining a choir or choral group to keep microbial invaders at bay.\n\nPop a Probiotic\n\nIn a study from the Rutgers School of Health Related Professions in New Jersey, people who took certain probiotics\u2014microorganisms believed to have disease-fighting properties\u2014caught colds at the same rate as those who got a placebo. But the symptoms of those treated with the probiotics ended two days sooner and were less severe.\n\nThe probiotics appear to reduce cold symptoms by muting the body\u2019s inflammatory response to cold viruses, says the lead author of the Rutgers study, Tracey J. Smith, a registered dietitian and an adjunct assistant professor at the school.\n\nThere are many choices among probiotics, which are available in capsules, powders and liquids and in some yogurts and other foods. Ms. Smith recommends looking for products with the strains used in the study, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium animalis lactis. She adds that people who have a serious chronic disease should check with a doctor before using probiotics.\n\nStay Rested\n\nPeople who sleep less than seven hours a night are three times as likely to catch a bug as those who put in eight-plus hours of shut-eye, Carnegie Mellon University researchers showed.\n\nIn a recent Finnish study, people who had received a flu shot and were then awakened after just a few hours of sleep produced fewer protective antibodies than those who slept normally after vaccination.\n\nPick the Right Supplement\n\nAlthough supplements won\u2019t stop a cold in its tracks, they may reduce your misery. Vitamin C (one to two grams a day) shortens colds slightly and, if you take it every day, may lessen symptoms when respiratory infections strike, according to the latest review of studies from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, a nonprofit health-care resource.\n\nAnother recent Cochrane review showed that zinc lozenges (75 milligrams a day) may cut a day or two off a cold if taken within 24 hours of the first cough or sniffle. (Note: Some users experience a bad taste or nausea.)\n\nGet a (Social) Life\n\nInteracting with lots of people would seem to multiply your chances for catching a bug. But a Carnegie Mellon study suggests a dynamic social life offers a hedge against respiratory illnesses.\n\nResearchers exposed a group of people to a cold virus, then waited to see who came down with the sniffles. Those with the most social networks\u2014such as club memberships, work friendships or participation in a faith community\u2014were least likely to get sick. Relative loners were more susceptible.\n\nCommunion with others may help by alleviating stress, though the study didn\u2019t address that.\n\nMs. Howard is a writer in North Carolina.

And how do you know the mutual fund or ETF with the \u201csustainable\u201d label fulfills its promise?\n\nInvestments marketed as sustainable\u2014meaning they focus on companies that incorporate environmental and social corporate-governance practices into long-term corporate strategies\u2014are experiencing explosive growth. Wall Street has jumped in with sustainable-investing divisions that create products for key demographics, like millennials, who are eager to align their values with their investments.\n\nAs of July 2015, assets invested in stock exchange-traded funds tracking MSCI Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) indexes had grown nearly 30% to $1.8 billion since the start of the year. Since December 2013, assets have more than doubled, with 22 new ESG ETFs tracking MSCI indexes.\n\nIn addition, MSCI has seen a huge increase in ESG indexes to more than 150 today, up from 25 in 2010.\n\nBut the investing style isn\u2019t always easy to practice, especially for an individual investor choosing what fund to buy on his or her own. Some claims and promises are too good to be true. And even people within the sustainable business can\u2019t agree on what is sustainable and what isn\u2019t.\n\nMatter of interpretation\n\nThe main issue is the lack of uniform information for both individual and institutional investors, meaning interpretation of the word \u201csustainable\u201d varies depending on who is using it. That can cloud investor decisions when it comes time to dedicate money to a specific fund.\n\nJean Rogers, chief executive and founder of the nonprofit Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, is trying to develop uniform standards for about 80 industries across 10 sectors.\n\nShe says the current pool of data around sustainability relies too much on voluntary corporate disclosures, such as annual sustainability reports and company questionnaires put together by institutional investors\u2014many of which ask different questions.\n\n\u201cIndividual investors are quite challenged to obtain this type of information in a way that is easily available and informs investment decisions\u2014either specific stock selections or products to manage or fund your 401(k),\u201d says Ms. Rogers. \u201cWe need better investible products,\u201d she adds. Ms. Rogers\u2019s board includes former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairwoman Mary Schapiro.\n\nThere are several popular funds available for investors who want to leave all the decisions to experts. One is Pax World Global Environmental Markets Fund (PGRNX). David Richardson, managing director at Impax Asset Management, which subadvises the fund, says his firm has helped create basic guideposts for sustainable investing during its 17 years in operation.\n\nThe firm\u2019s strategy first focused on excluding sectors like alcohol, tobacco and firearms. But that thesis has evolved. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have sustainable economic growth, you have to address core fundamentals of the economy,\u201d Mr. Richardson says: \u201cenergy, water, resources themselves, and food and agriculture.\u201d A company needs to go beyond efficient water use; it needs to make sustainable-water policies part of its overall operation, for instance, by not building factories where water supplies are under pressure.\n\nSustainable investing \u201cis harder than it looks,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople need to leave it to experts because we\u2019re charged with figuring this out with more granularity.\u201d\n\nEnter the robo advisers?\n\nTechnology may change that. Startups are aiming to make the automated money-management platforms known as robo advisers a central part of sustainable investing.\n\nSome online robo-adviser platforms, marketing themselves to millennials in particular, will pick out investments based on users\u2019 answers about investment preferences, then put a logarithm to work assembling a \u201csustainable\u201d portfolio that could include stocks and funds.\n\nSuch features, however, rely on the same cloudy data that Ms. Rogers and others in the sustainable-investing business are hoping to clarify. And as with any other investment, consumers should be aware of products that seem easy and too good to be true.\n\n\u201cYou can be indexed, or look for funds that are doing the work for you, or you can do it yourself and do a lot of work reading reports and validating data,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is just that: It\u2019s a lot of work if you\u2019re an individual investor and want sustainable investing.\u201d\n\nSo how does one create a \u201csustainable\u201d portfolio? Chat Reynders, chairman and chief executive of Boston-based Reynders, McVeigh Capital Management, suggests investors outline their values and see where they best align with trusted firms like Vanguard Group that have a wide portfolio of liquid indexed products. As with any other investment thesis, though, the key is due diligence and effort.\n\n\u201cThe danger in looking at a huge listing of indexes is that you may end up in less liquid ETFs or funds that seem great on their face but may have fundamental problems,\u201d says Mr. Reynders, whose Boston-based firm creates what it calls \u201csocially geared\u201d portfolios.\n\nThere is also the GIIN, or Global Impact Investing Network, which has been leading an effort to collect information about sustainable-investment strategies. The nonprofit\u2019s website includes a clearinghouse of research and strategies related to sustainable investing.\n\nAudrey Choi, chief executive of Morgan Stanley\u2019s Institute for Sustainable Investing Photo: Patrick Fallon/Bloomberg News\n\nWall Street gears up\n\nMajor investment firms like Morgan Stanley and BlackRock Inc. see the opportunity.\n\n\u201cClients are really starting to think differently about their portfolios,\u201d says Audrey Choi, chief executive of Morgan Stanley\u2019s Institute for Sustainable Investing. She cites a survey from US SIF, the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, that found that one out of six dollars under professional management is earmarked as sustainable, up from one out of nine in 2012. That increase comes as investors begin to see the benefits of sustainable investing, not just in how a company operates but also in what its stock returns to investors.\n\n\u201cESG factors are not extrafinancial factors,\u201d Ms. Choi says. \u201cThey are factors that can directly affect the financial outcome of an investment.\u201d She says much of her work focuses on showing people that sustainable investments tend to be less volatile and perform better than their traditional cousins.\n\nMr. Davidson is a writer in San Francisco.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-you-should-check-your-401-k-plans-fees-1447038127", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Illustration: Francesco Bongiorni\n\nLike many investors, the kind of retirement you have may largely depend on how much money you stuff into your 401(k) plan and how well the funds in it perform.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, though, you may want to take a closer look at what those investments are costing you.\n\nThe fees associated with 401(k) plans\u2014one of the primary benefits employers offer their employees\u2014can vary widely, and many investors don\u2019t understand just how damaging those expenses can be. Higher fees erode an investor\u2019s returns, putting a dent in a nest egg that gets bigger over time\u2014sometimes significantly so. That means less money when you decide to leave the workforce for good.\n\nEmployees of small businesses are particularly vulnerable. While smaller 401(k) plans typically cost more to run, partly because they don\u2019t have economies of scale, a recent report from 401(k) researcher BrightScope expressed \u201cshock\u201d at just how much more expensive smaller plans can be.\n\nAccording to the report, the average fee for smaller plans is between 1.5% and 2% annually, with many paying more than 2% a year in fees. That compares with less than 1% on average for larger plans, or those with more than $100 million in assets.\n\nSame fund, different fees\n\nMany mutual funds have multiple share classes with radically different fee structures, meaning different groups of investors pay different fees to invest in the same portfolio. Here\u2019s the problem: Even if your 401(k) plan contains otherwise solid funds, it may be offering you the share classes with the highest expense ratios.\n\nFor example, a target-date retirement fund for someone retiring in 10 years could have six retirement share classes with varying fees. That means the same fund with the same investments in it could cost 401(k) participants anywhere from 0.64% annually ($64 on $10,000 invested) to 1.39% ($139 on $10,000 invested).\n\nWhile a fee discrepancy of a little less than one percentage point might seem small, its effects are dramatic over time. If an employee contributes $5,000 annually for 40 years to a fund that produces a 6% annualized return, the employee is left with around $770,000 at retirement. But if the employee\u2019s investment earns only 5.25% because of an extra 0.75% fee, the investor is left with around $640,000 at retirement, robbing him or her of well over $100,000.\n\nShouldering the burden\n\nWhy is there such a big difference in fees among share classes?\n\nFees for record-keeping (which involves keeping track of balances, contributions, withdrawals and loans) and payments to brokers constitute the difference between the cheapest and most-expensive share classes of retirement-class funds from the same family, which is why the 401(k) is arguably a poor mechanism for retirement savings.\n\nLarger employers often foot the administrative costs associated with their retirement plans, allowing employees to benefit from cheaper share classes. For many small businesses, that may be a prohibitive expense. So if the lineup of funds in your 401(k) includes only the more expensive share classes, it could be an indication that your employer is relying on the asset manager or fund company to handle record-keeping in addition to the stock and bond picking, and dumping the extra costs on you by including only funds with higher expense ratios in its plan.\n\nRecord-keeping isn\u2019t the only thing that contributes to 401(k) costs. There also are legal documents associated with 401(k) plans that have to be drawn up by attorneys, filed with the Internal Revenue Service and rechecked periodically. This is usually handled by a third-party administrator, which is an additional expense not included in a fund\u2019s expense ratio.\n\nA plan\u2019s expenses also may reflect how well the employer has negotiated with a broker on his or her fees. The problem is, small-business owners aren\u2019t always savvy about financial markets or negotiating asset-management fees.\n\nWhen fund expenses push past 1% in what many observers expect to be a low-return environment, a 401(k) plan can become more a burden for employees than a benefit.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nNone of this necessarily speaks badly of the 401(k) providers that have multiple share classes of retirement funds. Many observers have argued that the 401(k) wasn\u2019t designed to be the major investment vehicle for most Americans, and requires policy overhaul.\n\nBut it is also true that fund companies with multiple share classes have stuck with an older distribution method, selling their products through full-cost brokers and advisers. Many businesses could probably save meaningfully on the broker fee by using discount brokerages such as Vanguard Group, Charles Schwab Corp. or Fidelity Investments, or by using one of the new robo advisers such as Wealthfront or Betterment.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, here are a few things employees who think they might be stuck in poor plans should do.\n\nEven if your 401(k) plan contains otherwise solid funds, it may be offering you the share classes with the highest expense ratios. Photo: iStockphotos/Getty Images\n\nFirst, check the expense ratios of the funds in your plan and whether those funds are available in share classes that come with lower expense ratios. Much of this information can be found on fund-research websites.\n\nAn actively managed stock fund that charges more than 1% is expensive. The same goes for a bond fund charging more than 0.50% and a target-date fund above 0.75%.\n\nIf you find that your plan is expensive, consider initiating a discussion with HR or the person in charge of the 401(k) plan at work.\n\nThis can be a difficult situation. A business owner may have a long-standing relationship with a trusted broker, so employees in many instances need to proceed delicately.\n\nBut small businesses increasingly are getting the message that fees matter, and they have to shop for good plans that may truly be called \u201cbenefits\u201d to their employees.\n\nMr. Coumarianos, a former Morningstar analyst, is a writer in Laguna Hills, Calif.

It\u2019s probably not coming.\n\nAccording to a growing body of research, midlife upheavals are more fiction than fact.\n\n\u201cDespite its popularity in the popular culture, there isn\u2019t much evidence for a midlife crisis,\u201d says Susan Krauss Whitbourne, a professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She is conducting a continuing study of more than 450 people who graduated from college between 1965 and 2006. The study\u2019s latest installment is scheduled for publication in 2015.\n\nThe term midlife crisis, coined in 1965 by psychoanalyst Elliot Jacques, was popularized in the 1970s by authors including Gail Sheehy. It quickly made its way into self-help books, television sitcoms and movies, from \u201cManhattan\u201d to \u201cAmerican Beauty.\u201d\n\nCrises at Any Age\n\nWhile initial research painted the midlife crisis as a predictable phase of adult psychological development, more recent studies on groups that are more representative of the population as a whole have largely debunked that notion, says Elaine Wethington, a professor of sociology at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.\n\nAccording to a continuing national study of midlife funded by the National Institute on Aging, 26% of adults ages 25 to 75 report having had a midlife crisis. Among respondents who are 50-plus, slightly more, 35%, say they\u2019ve had one.\n\nBut in the group that includes 30- and 40-somethings, only about half who reported having a midlife crisis said it was triggered by \u201cinner turmoil and angst associated with getting older,\u201d says Margie Lachman, a professor of psychology at Brandeis University and a researcher on the study. The rest of the crises, she says, were linked to problems that aren\u2019t unique to midlife, including job loss and divorce.\n\nMoreover, about the same proportion of study participants say they experienced crises at other points in their lives\u2014a result that is echoed by Prof. Whitbourne\u2019s results. Because many of the participants in her study who had crises in their 40s and 50s also experienced similar upheavals earlier in their lives, Prof. Whitbourne concludes, midlife doesn\u2019t put people at higher risk for crises.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that midlife is life\u2019s happiest period. In a 2008 study of 500,000 Americans and Europeans, economists Andrew Oswald of the U.K.\u2019s University of Warwick and David Blanchflower of Dartmouth College say life satisfaction reaches a low point around the mid-40s, perhaps due to stress associated with the simultaneous demands of work and family. But it rises after that.\n\nIt Gets Better\n\nProf. Lachman\u2019s research indicates that life satisfaction increases significantly from the 40s to the 50s\u2014and again from the 50s to the 60s\u2014as children and careers mature and salaries reach peak levels. While midlife is often a time of stress, Prof. Wethington says, those between the ages of 40 and 60 also \u201chave the resources and experience to manage more daily stress than younger people do.\u201d Midlifers, she adds, are \u201cchampion copers.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Arnett, a professor of psychology at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., says his research indicates that the 40s, 50s and 60s are often a time of \u201cre-evaluation and reassessment,\u201d particularly for empty-nesters. But while \u201cthere is anxiety that goes along with that,\u201d he says, many people also describe a feeling of \u201crenewed freedom and possibility.\u201d\n\nMidlife, he adds, \u201cis a surprisingly positive time of life.\u201d\n\nMs. Tergesen is a staff reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Many, of course, need the money. But many others say they simply enjoy\u2014even love\u2014what they do. And if that\u2019s the case, why not stay?\n\nShould you really quit your job via social media? Even if you don't opt for a public display, what should you know first? MarketWatch's Catey Hill discusses. Photo: Getty\n\nThe answer: Because jumping ship\u2014even if jumping would seem to make little sense\u2014could be the best way to remain productive, happy and healthy into old age.\n\nThe phenomenon of delayed retirement is well documented. Average retirement ages are climbing, and nearly half of baby boomers say they expect to work until age 66 or beyond, according to Gallup Inc. polls.\n\nFor the most part, that\u2019s good news, according to academics and financial and health-care professionals. Continuing to work in some fashion as we age can benefit mind and body, as well as beef up undersized nest eggs.\n\nTough Questions\n\nBut these same experts, and many older adults themselves, are discovering a downside to remaining at the same desk year after year\u2014a tendency toward complacency, coupled with a reluctance to ask tough questions.\n\nFor example: Am I working because I truly love what I do, or am I simply afraid of change? Do the best and brightest staffers want to work with me, or do they see better opportunities elsewhere? Am I continuing to learn something new about my work and myself, or am I plowing the same ground again and again?\n\n\u201cEspecially if you have been successful at what you have been doing, you start repeating yourself,\u201d says Sherry Lansing, age 70, who walked away from a job she loved as chief executive of Paramount Pictures\u2019 Motion Picture Group and now runs a foundation.\n\n\u201cYou have done it and you know how to do it, and that\u2019s comforting. But if you repeat yourself, the highs aren\u2019t as high and the lows aren\u2019t as low, and you start to lose that passion.\u201d\n\nThe good news is that those who take the leap frequently report there is more to gain than they imagined. Some say passing the torch, through mentoring, teaching or otherwise advising, can be just as gratifying as carrying the torch. Others say embracing a new opportunity made them fall in love with work all over again.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that every job ends someday. So is it better to be ready for that moment\u2014or even pre-empt it\u2014rather than have it catch you unprepared?\n\nPhilip Pizzo took the initiative at age 68 to step down as dean of Stanford University\u2019s School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cI knew that even if I wanted to stay in that role, at some point there would come a time when others would believe\u2014even if I was doing a good job or a great job\u2014that it\u2019s time for a transition,\u201d Dr. Pizzo says. \u201cThe question is, to what degree do you want to influence that change? To me, it was important to have an influence.\u201d\n\nWhat follows can help you measure your passion for your current job and offers a look at what might be waiting on the other side of a decision to try something new.\n\nA Look in the Mirror\n\nA good evaluation of your situation, career counselors suggest, includes two parts: internal, in which you appraise yourself and your performance; and external, in which you examine signals from others in the office.\n\nBill Winn, a psychologist with career-development firm New Directions Inc. in Boston, advises clients to start with a list of what they like and dislike about their jobs, keeping in mind such questions as: When I\u2019m \u201cin the zone\u201d and am so absorbed I fail to notice the passage of time, what am I doing? What am I not getting from my job? What have I set aside to do this job that I no longer want to delay?\n\nJacquelyn James, co-director of research at Boston College\u2019s Sloan Center on Aging and Work, puts it more bluntly. \u201cAre [you] embracing the next challenge\u2014or coasting?\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Lansing, the former Paramount Pictures executive, her first three decades in the movie industry \u201chad gone way beyond any of my dreams.\u201d But soon after her 50th birthday, with hundreds of movies under her belt, she began to feel she was no longer learning and growing as she had been.\n\n\u201cI watched the changes in myself,\u201d says Ms. Lansing. After her mother was diagnosed with cancer, for example, she became engrossed in \u201clearning about scientific advances.\u201d A former teacher, she also wanted to devote more time to her responsibilities as a member of the board of regents of the University of California.\n\n\u201cIf your priorities shift, that\u2019s normal and healthy,\u201d she says. \u201cIf your priorities don\u2019t shift, then I don\u2019t know if you are paying attention.\u201d\n\nOne thing that can get in the way of an honest appraisal is fear\u2014and not just of losing a paycheck. Peg Streep, co-author of \u201cMastering the Art of Quitting: Why It Matters in Life, Love, and Work,\u201d says people who \u201cprimarily define themselves by their professional roles\u201d have a harder time figuring out when it\u2019s time to move on. They also \u201cworry more about whether they should move on and what will replace the lost piece of identity,\u201d she says.\n\nThat was the case with Tess Vigeland, the former host of \u201cMarketplace Money,\u201d a weekly personal-finance program that aired on public radio stations nationwide until June. By 2012, after more than two decades in journalism, her \u201cgut\u201d was telling her to make a change, she recalls.\n\nBut she hesitated\u2014again and again\u2014before finally taking the leap into a new career as an author, public speaker and host of conferences and panels on topics including women in leadership roles.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think about how tied my self-esteem, self-worth and self-perception was to what I did for a living,\u201d she says today. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why I stayed as long as I did.\u201d\n\nMs. Vigeland, 45, says she wasn\u2019t only hooked on the ego boosts she got when people recognized her voice or name. She also worried she was \u201ctoo old to do something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you have done something for a long time and you are probably pretty good at it or you would have left a long time ago, it\u2019s hard to imagine yourself as anything else,\u201d she says.\n\nExternal Signals\n\nOf course, an internal evaluation might well produce one \u201cyes\u201d after the next. Yes, I\u2019m still growing and learning; yes, I\u2019m still seeking challenges. All of which is fine. But it\u2019s equally important to parse the external signals that others\u2014including bosses, colleagues and clients\u2014are sending your way, says Patricia Smith, a managing director at New Directions.\n\nSome are obvious, such as being passed over for a promotion. But other, less obvious clues can be equally telling. Dr. Pizzo, now 69, the former Stanford dean, recalls watching three leaders in their fields toward the end of their careers.\n\nTwo practiced medicine into their 70s, when one experienced deterioration of his technical skills as a surgeon and the other grew rigid in his thinking. Eventually, both were forced to resign from a prestigious medical institution, a denouement each could have avoided by heeding warning signals from colleagues, who had stopped asking for the doctors\u2019 advice and voted them out of leadership positions in their specialties.\n\nIn contrast, a colleague who has become a mentor of Dr. Pizzo\u2019s voluntarily closed his laboratory at Stanford when he stopped attracting top graduate students. Reputation intact, he segued into an advisory role at the medical school and the university at large.\n\n\u201cUnless you look at the road signs around you and make alterations in your career trajectory, you run the risk of missing the flashing yellow lights and being forced to transition,\u201d says Dr. Pizzo, who is now the head of Stanford\u2019s Distinguished Careers Institute, a new program for midcareer professionals transitioning to new acts.\n\nLaying the Groundwork\n\nMany \u201cquitters\u201d say they laid the groundwork for a move without really knowing they were doing so. But their experience suggests ways that others can set themselves up for a transition intentionally.\n\nMarvin Kaiser, 74, was the dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Portland State University in Oregon for 17 years. After stepping down as dean almost four years ago to return to teaching, he accepted a job as chief executive of Mary\u2019s Woods at Marylhurst, a continuing-care retirement community in Lake Oswego, Ore.\n\nMr. Kaiser had no plans to leave the academic world; in particular, he loved working with students and helping them \u201cbecome critical thinkers and stretch intellectually,\u201d he says. At the same time, though, he had long enjoyed building ties to the local community.\n\nIn 2001, he joined the board of Mary\u2019s Woods, and a decade later the community asked him to become its new CEO. A gerontologist by training, he accepted, realizing, he says, that the job was his \u201ccalling.\u201d\n\nMr. Kaiser says his post at Mary\u2019s Woods allows him to take \u201cmy lifetime of experiences, learning and, I hope, a little wisdom and bring some of that to bear in an organization that I believe in deeply.\u201d But the chance might have never presented itself, he says, if he hadn\u2019t done some stretching on his own.\n\nThe point: \u201cNetwork in your community so that these opportunities might be there\u201d if you decide to make a change, Mr. Kaiser says.\n\nThe Payoff\n\nMany of those who have made the leap say they have emerged with not only a new path in life but also a new understanding of themselves.\n\nAn architect who specialized in renovating high-end homes in New York City, Mary T. O\u2019Connor, 59, had worked for nonprofits throughout her career, designing and renovating small theaters in the New York area. But as she became more established in the residential market, her theater work dwindled.\n\nIn 2006, Ms. O\u2019Connor inadvertently revived that passion, when\u2014reeling from the death of her mother and the dissolution of a long-term relationship\u2014she decided to take time off to join the Peace Corps. In the Philippines, she designed and supervised the construction of a theater for a children\u2019s-rights organization, which uses drama therapy to help young victims of sexual abuse. The experience, she adds, reignited her youthful idealism. \u201cI felt like I was really helping people.\u201d\n\nAfter returning to New York in 2010, Ms. O\u2019Connor picked up where she left off designing homes and offices. \u201cI thought, OK, I got that out of my system. Now, I\u2019m going back to the work and life I love,\u201d she says. But re-entry proved unexpectedly difficult. \u201cI had everything I thought I wanted, but my life just didn\u2019t feel like the life I was meant to lead anymore.\u201d\n\nChange of Course\n\nWhen a friend in Akron, Ohio, invited her to visit, Ms. O\u2019Connor says, \u201cI realized there were plenty of places in the U.S. where I could do the community work I had done in the Peace Corps.\u201d She ended up moving to Akron. With a lower cost of living, she supports herself renovating public buildings, including a community center and an independent cinema in what she describes as the \u201cdiminished\u201d downtown.\n\n\u201cIt feels liberating,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to be in a place where my experience can support enlarging the community.\u201d\n\nAnd what of her decision to walk away from her career and life in New York? It was \u201cfraught with peril,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Connor recalls. \u201cIt was work I really loved, [and] I told people, \u2018I can never leave New York. It\u2019s my home.\u2019 I still sort of feel that way.\u201d But, she adds, she also knows she can always return.\n\nHer advice is to wade in gradually and find ways to do some of the things you think you will miss. She retained her New York apartment until she was sure things were working out in Akron. \u201cThat took the fear out of [the move]. It wasn\u2019t a complete break,\u201d she says. And she recently designed and helped build a house for her sister\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cQuitting doesn\u2019t have to be irrevocable,\u201d she says. \u201cI adopted the idea of a trial, making a transition in phases.\u201d Akron, she adds, \u201chas been a much bigger life than I imagined.\u201d\n\n\u2018Passing the Torch\u2019\n\nOthers say the opportunity to spend time \u201cpassing the torch\u201d\u2014by mentoring, lecturing, consulting, advising, teaching and serving on boards\u2014can be just as fulfilling as building a career.\n\nThe \u201cprocess of giving knowledge, time and energy to the broader community\u201d taps into \u201cdeeply felt human needs to make a lasting contribution,\u201d says Brian Fetherstonhaugh, chairman and chief executive of digital and direct marketing agency OgilvyOne Worldwide, who lectures and writes about career development.\n\nMany who move on also find a better work-life balance. Dr. Pizzo, who worked \u201c24/7\u201d as dean of Stanford\u2019s Medical School, says his current schedule of five or sometimes six days a week at the Distinguished Careers Institute gives him more time for family, including four grandchildren.\n\nHe also expects his decision to move into a new field will enhance his cognitive and mental health as he ages.\n\n\u201cI wanted to move from a field I knew and was comfortable in to a new beginning,\u201d he says. Aside from creating \u201cnew neural networks,\u201d starting over will ensure that \u201cI won\u2019t have to compare myself as an aging elder in medicine to my past self,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cYou reach a certain point where you can never climb to the same level again. I didn\u2019t want to be that person looking at myself in the shadow of my past. I wanted to create a new shadow.\u201d\n\nMs. Tergesen is a staff reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Two things: a clear understanding of risk, and the importance of \u201cglide paths.\u201d\n\nNo, we aren\u2019t talking about skiing or aircraft, but rather adjusting a portfolio\u2019s stock/bond mix with age, particularly in retirement.\n\nThe most venerable method for doing so, the age-in-bonds formula, reduces your equity allocation by one percentage point a year. A 25-year-old, for example, holds 25% in bonds, and thus 75% in stocks, whereas an 80-year-old holds 80% bonds and 20% stocks.\n\nThe theory behind this rule is simple and intuitive: Stocks are less risky for young investors, who have years to overcome bear markets, than they are for retirees, who depend on their investments for much of their income.\n\nBut venerable, as we are learning, doesn\u2019t always mean prudent. There are other glide paths\u2014in the opposite direction of the age-in-bonds path\u2014that do a better job of protecting retirees against the greatest risk they face: running out of money.\n\nAn Eyebrow Raiser\n\nEarlier this year, Wade Pfau, a professor of retirement income at American College in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and Michael Kitces, research director of Pinnacle Advisory Group in Columbia, Md., ruffled feathers with an influential study in the Journal of Financial Planning showing that increasing the equity allocation throughout retirement was a bit less risky than lowering it.\n\nThe results weren\u2019t all that dramatic; they found, for example, that at a 4% annual withdrawal rate, a portfolio that began retirement at 30% stocks and increased over the next 30 years to 80% succeeded (that is, lasted 30 years) 74% of the time. An approximate age-in-bonds portfolio that began at 40% equity and decreased to 10% over 30 years yielded a 73% success rate.\n\nA difference without a distinction, you might say, but it surprised many that increasing equity exposure to a stratospheric 80% toward the end of life didn\u2019t add risk.\n\nSo, now what\u2019s an investor supposed to think? The answer isn\u2019t a simple stock/bond split that adjusts according to any formula. But it does result in stocks accounting for a growing portion of a portfolio.\n\nAs a starting point, the safest approach is for an investor to build a portfolio that throws off enough principal and income to cover the investor\u2019s expenses. One way to do that, for those who have enough assets, is to buy an inflation-adjusted annuity with payouts that match projected spending. A TIPS ladder\u2014a collection of Treasury inflation-protected securities with varied maturities to provide a steady stream of principal and income over many years\u2014also is a good way to match that spending.\n\nBut neither approach is perfect. The payout rates of inflation-adjusted annuities are historically low, so the payout an investor needs\u2014whatever it may be\u2014costs more than ever before. Also, purchasers run the risk that the insurance company they buy the annuity from will default, a possibility highlighted by the recent financial crisis. True, most states \u201cguarantee\u201d annuities, but in the event of a severe systemic crisis, those promises might not be worth much.\n\nOn the other hand, a retiree might outlive even a 30-year TIPS ladder. Further, it\u2019s best, for tax-reporting reasons, to confine TIPS to tax-sheltered accounts, and many investors don\u2019t have a sheltered account big enough to hold the entire ladder.\n\nA more prudent course of action might be to hold standard Treasury securities and high-quality municipal and corporate bonds of short maturity in lieu of purchasing either an annuity or TIPS. Why short maturities? Because interest rates are so low now. Short maturities don\u2019t lock investors into those low rates for the long term; they allow money to be reinvested at higher interest rates later should the opportunity arise.\n\nThe key point is that all three choices\u2014an inflation-adjusted annuity, TIPS ladder or short-bond portfolio\u2014or any combination of them would match the retiree\u2019s annual needs well, because they all provide a known stream of income and principal over the years. A portfolio starting at 60% bonds and 40% stocks with a subsequent glide path away from equities most certainly doesn\u2019t provide that assurance.\n\nWhat does matching investments to spending look like in real life? Imagine a 65-year-old man named Fred who has $50,000 in annual living expenses and taxes, no pension, and $20,000 of annual Social Security income, and whose entire savings consist of a $1 million rollover IRA.\n\nFred needs an inflation-adjusted $30,000 a year to make up the difference between Social Security and his expenses. Currently, he can purchase an inflation-adjusted annuity that will accomplish this for $625,000. This is the amount that meets his basic living needs in retirement. In finance-speak, this is Fred\u2019s liability-matching portfolio, or LMP.\n\nBut Fred, like many retirees, doesn\u2019t like the idea of handing over such a large chunk of change to an insurance company. Delaying Social Security to age 70, he realizes, increases his annual payout to $28,300 a year\u2014knocking down the amount he will need from his investments at that point to $21,700 a year. He\u2019ll \u201cpay\u201d for this extra benefit by meeting his $50,000 annual living expenses out of his nest egg for the next five years.\n\nHe reckons that a $750,000 portfolio of TIPS and high-quality corporate bonds yielding a real return of 1% a year, from which he will withdraw $50,000 annually before age 70 and $21,700 a year thereafter, will last him to age 98. He can put the remaining $250,000 into a globally diversified portfolio of stocks. Let\u2019s call this $250,000 of equities his risk portfolio, or RP.\n\nStocks on the Side\n\nSo, Fred begins retirement with a 25/75 stock/bond split. But as he taps his bonds, his stock allocation will rise; if he lives to 98, he\u2019ll have an all-stock portfolio. What happens if he makes it much past 98? He will need what retirement specialists call longevity insurance, and his risk portfolio, under all but the worst scenarios, should provide just that. After all, doubling the value of his stock portfolio to an inflation-adjusted $500,000 by age 98 requires only a 2.12% real annualized return.\n\nThe reverse-glide-path approach, then, works because it starts out with a large, ultrasafe liability-matching portfolio and a small risk portfolio. As the retiree ages, the LMP gets spent down and the RP gets larger.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing special or new about this; it\u2019s simply a variant of the long-established \u201ctwo-bucket\u201d approach that separates, with mental accounting, a safe portfolio dedicated to essential living expenses from a risky one aimed at one\u2019s heirs, charities and the odd business-class seat.\n\nReverse glide path or two-bucket LMP/RP strategy? You say tuh-may-toe, I say tuh-mah-toe. Either approach will do a superb job of minimizing your risk of dying poor.\n\nMr. Bernstein is an investment adviser and author, most recently of \u201cIf You Can: How Millennials Can Get Rich Slowly.\u201d He can be reached at encore@wsj.com.", "date": null, "title": "How to Think About Risk in Retirement"}
{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-year-end-game-plan-for-investors-1447038003", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Illustration: Zohar Lazar\n\nIt has been a tough year for many investors as the stock market has sputtered and shuddered like it hasn\u2019t in a long time.\n\nAnd get ready for 2016, when the U.S. presidential election campaign has the potential to roil markets, along with the usual assortment of economic developments and overseas turmoil.\n\nFaced with uncertainty and volatility, what\u2019s an investor to do? We asked investment pros the question, and here\u2019s their advice: Take the opportunity to book gains or losses before year-end, while pruning speculative holdings. Check whether stock and bond allocations still line up with long-term targets.\n\nAnd while low-cost index funds are still a good choice in many cases, experts say this is the kind of market in which some investors should consider an active fund, whose manager might find bargains in battered sectors.\n\nHere are five things advisers suggest investors might do now:\n\n1. Rebalance\u2014now, not later\n\nThis year\u2019s market swings might have caused many portfolios\u2019 mix of stocks and bonds to change significantly, throwing investors off the course designed for them to achieve the best long-term results.\n\nAdvisers differ on how often a portfolio should be rebalanced, but the general idea is to act when allocations have strayed past a certain point. For instance, researchers at mutual-fund behemoth Vanguard Group suggest reviewing holdings once or twice a year and rebalancing by adding to or trimming allocations whenever they have moved at least five percentage points away from an investor\u2019s targets.\n\nIn a down market, that means many investors should add to stockholdings, to keep enough equity in a portfolio to hedge against long-term inflation and the risk that their money won\u2019t grow enough to provide sufficient funds in their later years.\n\nInvestors need to maintain that discipline even if they fear further losses in stocks, says Tripp Yates, a wealth strategist for Waddell & Associates Inc. in Memphis, Tenn. \u201cHuman nature and our emotions cause us to want to wait until things have stabilized\u201d to buy more stocks, he says. But by the time most investors feel certain that the market has turned back up, they may have already missed out on significant gains, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to pick a target asset allocation for your investment assets and stick with it.\u201d\n\n2. Trim risk\n\nOwning hot stocks, or mutual funds that invest in a hot sector, may be thrilling when their prices rocket upward. But \u201cchasing momentum in the seventh year of a bull market could be dangerous,\u201d says Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman\u2019s wealth-management unit.\n\nCompanies with strong balance sheets and good cash flow may be more boring, \u201cbut they provide some protection in a downturn,\u201d he says. Johnson & Johnson is one example of that kind of company, Mr. Clemons says.\n\nInvestors can draw distinctions within market sectors. For instance, in the health-care sector, biotechnology stocks were among the hottest shares earlier this year, but many fell this fall after political candidates criticized drug-pricing practices. To avoid that kind of volatility, investors could consider owning health-care companies whose prospects aren\u2019t as closely tied to pharmaceuticals, particularly those that score high on the returns they get from invested capital, says Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer of the trust arm of Bryn Mawr Bank Corp. , near Philadelphia. Historically, companies with those high returns been relatively strong performers in the late stages of bull markets, he says.\n\nInvestors who want to avoid single-stock risk could buy an ETF that covers a certain sector, notes New York-based adviser Robert Leahy. Or, they could diversify further by investing in an ETF that tracks the entire U.S. stock market, he adds.\n\n3. Harvest losses and gains\n\nAs year-end approaches, many investors sell laggard stocks so they can use the losses to reduce the tax they will owe on gains by their other stocks. Before doing so, it is important to know that under Internal Revenue Service rules, investors can\u2019t claim a loss on a tax return from a sale of securities if they buy back \u201csubstantially identical\u201d shares within 30 days of the sale.\n\nHowever, if someone wants to continue owning shares of a company uninterrupted and still harvest some losses, it is permissible to use a \u201cdouble up\u201d strategy, says David Levi, senior managing director in Minneapolis for CBIZ MHM LLC, a professional-services concern.\n\nThat means buying more shares of the same stock, waiting more than 30 days, and then selling some or all of the shares bought earlier that now are trading at a loss. People who are unsure about the rules should ask a tax professional.\n\nMr. Levi says investors also are permitted under IRS rules to sell an actively managed sector mutual fund where they have a loss and simultaneously buy a similar fund offered by another fund company. Another strategy investors sometimes use is to sell a losing stock while simultaneously buying an exchange-traded fund that tracks that market sector.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger, it also might make sense to book gains in stocks that have rebounded strongly from this year\u2019s lows if an investor isn\u2019t confident that those shares have more upside, says New York-based adviser Lewis Altfest. He cites the recent gains in some energy stocks despite continued concerns about the trend in oil prices.\n\nSeen worse, but...: A trader at the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 14, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 157.14 points.

Consider adding a stock picker\n\nInvestors in recent years have flocked to funds designed to track various market indexes rather than rely on the judgment of a fund manager to pick stocks. The popularity of index funds is based largely on data showing that over many years, very few active managers outperform market indexes.\n\nBut current market conditions are an opportunity for active managers to shine\u2014and for investors to beat the indexes\u2014says Lisette Cooper, founder and chief executive of Athena Capital Advisors in Lincoln, Mass. Athena, for instance, has trimmed its clients\u2019 holdings of exchange-traded funds that invest in emerging markets and invested more with active managers in the sector, says Ms. Cooper.\n\nIn the case of emerging-markets ETFs, \u201cthere are going to be some great opportunities for certain individual stocks, whose valuations will likely be dragged down with the broader market,\u201d she says. \u201cWe think active, value-oriented managers can best take advantage of the opportunities that will be available.\u201d\n\nOf course, not just any active fund will do. Ms. Cooper says Athena looks for, among other things, a clearly articulated strategy to beat market indexes and a record of success. Among actively managed emerging-markets funds, she likes Matthews Pacific Tiger Fund (MAPTX), which focuses on Asia with the exception of Japan. (More on the fund in this related Spotlight article.)\n\n5. Keep more cash on hand\n\nSome financial advisers are keeping more of their clients\u2019 money out of both stocks and bonds these days. At Brown Brothers Harriman, cash positions in client portfolios recently rose to about 15% to 20%, up from 3% or less in 2009, says Mr. Clemons. That shift is \u201ca recognition that at this point in the cycle, valuations are a little stretched, earnings growth has weakened and it\u2019s prudent to keep some money on the sidelines,\u201d he says.\n\nDon\u2019t overdo cash despite any concerns about the economy or markets, says Ms. Cooper. \u201cWe see continued volatility and reasons for concern,\u201d she says, \u201cbut not reasons for taking all your money out of the market.\u201d\n\nMr. Pollock is a writer in Ridgewood, N.J. He can be reached at reports@wsj.com.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nUnder IRS rules, investors can generally claim a loss on a tax return from a sale of securities held less than 30 days as long as they don\u2019t buy back \u201csubstantially identical\u201d shares within 30 days of the sale. An earlier version of this article incorrectly suggested that they can\u2019t ever claim a loss when selling shares within 30 days.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dude-what-happened-to-my-bond-portfolio-1449460374", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Illustration: Jason Schneider\n\nBonds, supposedly the safer alternative to stocks, aren\u2019t looking so safe right now. While the S&P 500 index is up 1.6% this year, many fixed-income funds have negative returns\u2014particularly those that own a lot of lower-rated bonds. Some are down 4% or more.\n\nFundholders might wonder, \u201cDude, what happened to my bond portfolio?\u201d says Ted Wiese, head of fixed income at T. Rowe Price. The answer, he says, is that many investors had the right idea in buying bonds for income and as a cushion against a stock-market decline but bought the wrong kinds of bonds for the job.\n\nSpecifically, Mr. Wiese says that many investors have sought funds that offer the highest yields. Those also carry the most risk, and they have been battered this year by worries about a global economic slowdown and the collapse of many commodity prices, among other things.\n\nFor those worried about a bond fund\u2019s performance, here are some key issues to understand:\n\n1. Consider the two types of risk\n\nBond yields move opposite to bond prices, so rising interest rates erode the value of a mutual fund\u2019s bondholdings. That\u2019s rate risk.\n\nBonds paying higher interest rates\u2014generally those with lower credit ratings\u2014provide more cushion against rate risk, because the investor gets more yield to help offset any price declines. But these bonds carry greater default risk, and a company doesn\u2019t have to actually default for that risk to hurt an investor. Prices of high-yield bonds tend to fall whenever concerns arise about the issuer\u2019s ability to repay its debt, and that can happen because of developments that affect the issuer directly or because of broader economic developments.\n\nSo investors should ask themselves, is it better at this point to take interest-rate risk or default risk? Rate risk has been on a lot of investors\u2019 minds for months amid speculation about when the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates.\n\nFor now, default risk may loom larger, says Bob Zenouzi, a fund manager at Delaware Investments. Companies have sold a lot of bonds to finance share buybacks and dividend increases, and yields have been rising for certain corporate bonds as investors have demanded more compensation for the perceived increase in credit risk, he says. While a market meltdown doesn\u2019t look likely, \u201cyellow lights are flashing for investors in riskier securities,\u201d Mr. Zenouzi says.\n\n2. How credit quality has made a difference this year\n\nHigh-yield bonds have had a bumpy ride. High-yield fund returns were nearly negative 5% on average in the third quarter and about negative 2% for 2015 through November.\n\nAmong those affected is the Eaton Vance Bond fund (EVBAX), which has almost 38% of its holdings in below-investment-grade securities. Although it generates more than 6% annually in yield\u2014one of the highest of any bond fund\u2014its total return this year through November is nearly minus 12%.\n\nManager Kathleen Gaffney says she buys securities she believes are undervalued. The fund\u2019s holdings currently include some depressed energy-company bonds, so the fund eventually could be boosted by a recovery in commodity prices spurred by global economic growth, she says.\n\nIn contrast, while RidgeWorth Seix Total Return Bond (CBPSX) yields only about 1.5%, its return this year is 0.6% through November. More than a third of its bonds are U.S. Treasurys, and 70%-plus are triple-A.\n\nJim Keegan, chief investment officer of Seix Investment Advisors, says the fund is designed to help anchor a portfolio against the greater risk that fundholders might be taking elsewhere, such as in stocks.\n\n3. Newer ways to diversify\n\nFund firms have introduced products that are managed opportunisticallymuch like hedge funds. Often called unconstrained funds, they can own whatever sorts of fixed-income securities their managers believe offer the best opportunity at a given time. Some also take short positions, using derivatives to bet against a certain sector of the bond market.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Asset Management sometimes suggests adding such a fund to a portfolio that also contains higher-quality and higher-yielding bond funds\u2014in place of the cash position such a portfolio might also have. An unconstrained fund could generate better returns than a cash allocation while providing an offset against the rate risk that could cause principal losses in a traditional bond fund, says Priscilla Hancock, a global fixed-income strategist at the firm.\n\nThe challenge, though, may be finding such a fund that also buffers against equity risk, says Morningstar analyst Sarah Bush. Many unconstrained funds own U.S. high-yield and emerging-markets bonds, which often trade in sync with stocks. Unconstrained funds posted third-quarter average returns of nearly negative 2%, and the average return for this year through November is negative 0.6%.\n\nA fund that takes a more conservative approach by limiting both credit and rate risk is Metropolitan West Unconstrained Bond (MWCRX), Ms. Bush says. It returned negative 0.55% in the third quarter, but its return for the first 11 months of this year was positive 0.2%.\n\n4. A high-quality ETF to pair with higher-yielding funds\n\nTreasurys often move in the opposite direction of stocks, which is called a negative correlation. So, although Treasurys don\u2019t pay great yields and pose rate risk, they offer diversification from stocks and from higher-yielding bond funds. An investor can easily get that same benefit from a Treasury ETF. More than 30 Treasury ETFs are available.\n\nExact correlations vary over time. But according to a Morningstar analysis, over the past 10 years, high-yield bonds have tended to rise or fall as much as about three-fourths of moves in the S&P 500.\n\n5. Consider a globally focused bond fund\n\nGlobal bond funds are another way to diversify, by spreading risk geographically and balancing movements in stocks. A global fund that hedges against currency movements \u201cdefinitely can be a good diversifier and has pretty low correlations with the U.S. equities market as long as you are sticking with higher quality,\u201d says Morningstar\u2019s Ms. Bush. \u201cThere are some global funds with very large emerging-markets positions, so it\u2019s a matter of knowing what you own.\u201d\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nDreyfus/Standish Global Fixed Income Fund (DHGAX) yields about 1.5% annually, and its return was near zero in the third quarter, when returns averaged negative 1.2% in Morningstar\u2019s world bond fund groupand negative 6.2% for its emerging-markets bond category. The fund\u2019s 2015 return through Nov. 30 was 0.1%.\n\nThe fund generally invests in at least eight countries and hedges currency risk. Raman Srivastava, co-manager of the fund, says hedging damps volatility, although it means giving up some yield. Mr. Srivastava says the approach works for clients who want fixed income \u201cfor stability and diversification, not for equity-like returns or equity-like volatility.\u201d\n\nMr. Pollock is a writer in Ridgewood, N.J.

His retirement from Magellan in 1990 was a bombshell. Photo: Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\nPeter Lynch wants you to know that his ideas are being misquoted widely.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never said, \u2018If you go to a mall, see a Starbucks and say it\u2019s good coffee, you should call Fidelity brokerage and buy the stock,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Lynch says, some 25 years after his retirement from running Magellan Fund was front-page news.\n\nFlashback to 1990 Peter Lynch Leaves Magellan (\u2018I\u2019m turning in my Quotron\u2019) Page One, Wall Street Journal, March 29, 1990\n\nFollowing the market still at age 71, he instead explains his philosophy this way: Use your specialized knowledge to home in on stocks you can analyze, study them and then decide if they\u2019re worth owning. The best way to invest is to look at companies competing in the field where you work. Someone with deep restaurant-industry experience would have predicted the success of Panera Bread Co. and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., he says: \u201cIf you\u2019re in the steel industry and it ever turns around, you\u2019ll see it before I do.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with the popular-wisdom version of his ideology, which is usually cited as \u201cinvest in what you know\u201d? It leaves out the role of serious fundamental stock research. \u201cPeople buy a stock and they know nothing about it,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s gambling and it\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\nMr. Lynch was a mutual-fund rock star. When he ran Magellan, he says, one of every 100 Americans was invested in it. Though he is on boards at Fidelity Investments in Boston, since leaving fund management he has kept to philanthropy. With his late wife, Carolyn, who died in October, he ran a foundation that funded mainly educational and health-related nonprofits in Massachusetts and beyond, such as Teach for America, Partners in Health and the Posse Foundation. He managed the money and Mrs. Lynch chose the recipients.\n\nThe market is different than in 1990. One of the biggest changes: exchange-traded funds. Mr. Lynch credits their rise with a distrust of mutual-fund managers, which he says is unwarranted. \u201cPeople accept that active managers can\u2019t beat the market and it\u2019s just not true,\u201d he says. (A Fidelity spokesman says about three-quarters of its 49 equity funds managed by the same portfolio manager for at least five years were beating their benchmark over the manager\u2019s tenure as of Sept. 30.) Mr. Lynch\u2019s advice for small investors: Picking individual stocks is hard even for the professionals. So \u201cif you can\u2019t understand the balance sheet, you probably shouldn\u2019t own it.\u201d\n\nEven stars have bad calls. Mr. Lynch is known for a 13-year run of successes, but he quickly points out his missteps. When his daughters bought him an iPod, \u201cI should have done the math\u201d and figured out how much Apple Inc. was earning on the devices.

The SEC is chewing on a list of questions about the products\u2019 trading and marketing in the wake of the Aug. 24 \u201cflash crash,\u201d when the price of many ETFs appeared to come unhinged from their underlying value, and some financial advisers say they are now wary about recommending the products to clients.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Luis A. Aguilar wonders if the \u2018entire ETF ecosystem\u2019 should be re-examined. Photo: Brendan Smialowski\n\nIt isn\u2019t as if ETFs haven\u2019t faced questions before, from both regulators and financial-industry insiders. However, the recent questions have taken this scrutiny to a new level.\n\n\u201cNo one sits around debating the merits of the mutual fund,\u201d says Matt Tucker, director of fixed-income strategy for the iShares unit of ETF giant BlackRock Inc. But ETFs, he adds, still aren\u2019t \u201cmainstream enough.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s an investor to think? Are the concerns legitimate? For those looking to practice \u201csafe ETF,\u201d here are five questions to consider:\n\n1. Do ETF investors have enough safeguards?\n\nThere are plenty of consumer-protection regulations surrounding ETFs, but that doesn\u2019t mean the rules are airtight.\n\nInitially created to track indexes, ETFs are similar to mutual funds in that they mostly consist of baskets of stocks and bonds, but they are different in that they trade on exchanges all day like stocks.\n\nBecause of ETFs\u2019 hybrid nature\u2014and because there is no separate \u201cETF law\u201d\u2014they are governed partly by the Investment Company Act of 1940, which sets rules for mutual funds, and partly by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which sets rules for brokers and exchange oversight.\n\nThe problem is, neither law was designed to account for a product that relies on second-by-second pricing of both itself and a collection of other securities. As Aug. 24 showed, ETFs in rough markets can fall harder than the prices of their underlying assets. In normal markets, ETF traders who profit from zooming in and out of the ETFs and their underlying holdings keep the values in line, but investors have been startled to see that balance can be disrupted at times.\n\nETFs are a \u201cdigital-age technology\u201d governed by \u201cDepression-era legislation,\u201d analysts at fund-tracker Morningstar have said.\n\nExchanges, as well as some fund providers, are examining how to prevent these rare trading anomalies. Meanwhile, the risk that ETFs may not always trade or price as expected is one that investors need to consider.\n\n2. Everyone is doing it. Do I need to be invested in ETFs?\n\nYou don\u2019t need ETFs any more than you need to buy the latest iPhone. One reason investors have poured money into ETFs is their tax efficiency and typically low fees (which is possible because 93% of the products track indexes with low turnover, according to researcher XTF Inc., which is what keeps down transaction costs and realized capital gains).\n\nHowever, ETFs aren\u2019t the only game in town when it comes to low-cost investing. In certain asset classes, index-tracking mutual funds can be just as cheap as comparable ETFs. What\u2019s more, while ETFs are known for their tax efficiency, that may not be of great importance to everyone, especially those who don\u2019t plan to hold the funds in taxable accounts.\n\nWhat matters most\u2014and what investors should focus on\u2014is whether a fund\u2019s underlying portfolio fits with their goals, says Rick Ferri, the founder of Portfolio Solutions and long a proponent of index investing. \u201cLook under the hood,\u201d he advises, because many funds that seem similar really aren\u2019t and will produce very different results. From there, investors can assess the product\u2019s structure and whether the costs involved in holding or trading it are a good fit for them.\n\nFor some people, ETFs\u2019 intraday tradability is a strong selling point. Unlike mutual funds, which can be bought or sold only at each day\u2019s closing net asset value (NAV), ETFs can be traded all day on exchanges, which usually makes it easier for investors to get into or out of positions at a market price quickly (except, of course, on days like Aug. 24). \u201cHow important is that to you?\u201d Mr. Ferri asks.\n\nOthers like ETFs because they offer a way to get low-cost exposure to corners of the market that used to be inaccessible to most individual investors.\n\n\u201cETFs have democratized access to a broad array of asset classes,\u201d says Onur Erzan, director of McKinsey & Co.\u2019s North American asset-management practice. \u201cThis has improved the ability of investors and advisers to construct more granular and efficient portfolios,\u201d he says. These include specific segments of the government and corporate debt markets, including high-yield securities (junk bonds) and bank loans, as well as hard-to-reach economies such as China, India and other developing markets, domestic and international sectors and industries, and socially responsible themes. On top of these, some asset managers offer currency hedging within the ETF and leveraged or short daily exposure geared more toward professional traders.\n\n3. What happened in August and could it happen again?\n\nCritics say stock-market swings on Aug. 24 exposed the flaws in ETFs they have been warning about for years. Proponents say ETFs mostly were caught in the crossfire of marketwide trading issues that had little to do with them. One thing is for sure: It wasn\u2019t the first time ETFs have surprised investors.\n\nETFs were in focus during the flash crash of 2010, in which bids on dozens of ETFs (and other stocks) fell as low as a penny a share, and again in 2013, when municipal-bond ETFs traded at a discount to their net asset values during the \u201ctaper tantrum,\u201d when bond yields jumped.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Kara Stein says ETFs \u2018break down in ways that we do not completely understand.\u2019 Photo: Mandel Ngan/Getty Images\n\nAnd then came Aug. 24. The debacle was a test for the labyrinth of new regulations put in place after the 2010 flash crash, and it wasn\u2019t pretty. As the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1,000 points, triggers went off for mandated halts in many stocks held by ETFs, as well as the ETFs themselves. Then, a number of ETFs stunned investors by trading at prices far below their NAV, highlighting concerns that ETFs might not be as easy to move in and out of at \u201cfair\u201d prices when markets are in disarray.\n\nIn response to the Aug. 24 debacle, the three U.S. listing exchanges\u2014the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Stock Market and BATS Global Markets Inc.\u2014indicated they will no longer accept stop-loss orders on any traded securities. Such orders seem to protect investors by triggering a sale when a target price is met, but at a certain point in a falling market they become \u201cmarket orders\u201d that are completed at any price. The NYSE is considering a way to flag \u201caberrant\u201d ETF trades.\n\nMeanwhile, it may be more advisable than ever for investors to use limit orders\u2014orders to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better, literally putting a limit on how low the price can go.\n\n\u201cHave good trading hygiene,\u201d says Dave Nadig, director of ETFs for FactSet. \u201cThe vast majority of ETFs deliver on their core promise to investors. But if you trade them poorly, that\u2019s probably on you.\u201d\n\n4. What parts of the ETF market should I be most wary of?\n\nInvestors should be wary of \u201cany area where there\u2019s a lot of product development,\u201d Mr. Nadig says.\n\nRegulatory issues aside, the \u201csafety\u201d of any financial product largely depends on how well an investor understands it, and in this regard, the ETF ecosystem has grown more complicated in recent years.\n\nThe idea behind the earliest index-tracking ETFs was pretty simple: provide investors with market-cap-weighted exposure to entire markets or giant chunks of markets at the lowest possible cost.\n\nSince then, ETF offerings have proliferated. Anyone with a brokerage account can now choose from among more than 1,800 different exchange-traded products, covering almost every conceivable market sector, niche and trading strategy. While some advisers love that\u2014it gives them an easy, low-cost way to provide clients with exposure to certain market segments\u2014the concern is that some less-sophisticated investors may be buying complex, heavily marketed funds without fully understanding what they are getting.\n\n\u201c \u2018Smart beta,\u2019 in particular, creates real due-diligence problems,\u201d Mr. Nadig says, referring to the growth in index products that shun traditional market-cap weightings and instead weight holdings according to an investment factor such as volatility, value, quality or momentum.\n\n\u201cWith some new factor-based ETFs, it can be very hard to really understand what you are getting and why,\u201d says Mr. Nadig. It requires understanding how the fund is segmenting securities based on a factor such as value, how it is weighting stocks in the portfolio, how often its index is rebalanced, and whether there are stock or sector limitations or weights.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have the knowledge or time to build and manage a complex portfolio, it may be best to stick with broad-based index ETFs with significant assets and trading volume, experts say, and leave the niches to the pros.\n\n5. Where do ETFs go from here?\n\nEven as ETFs continue to surge in popularity, gobbling up $200 billion in investors\u2019 dollars so far this year, their emerging dominance in the passive-investing world is already being challenged.\n\nOnline broker Motif Investing, for example, offers low-cost direct investing in baskets of up to 30 stocks tied to investment themes, industries and sectors. It charges only $9.95 per \u201cmotif\u201d trade or rebalance order.\n\nAmong \u201crobo advisers,\u201d which are automated investing services, Wealthfront now offers direct indexing for clients with more than $100,000. Instead of using an ETF, Wealthfront will buy anywhere from 100 to 1,000 individual stocks, proportional to their share in Standard & Poor\u2019s market-cap-weighted U.S. indexes, and harvest tax losses at the individual security level. The company charges 0.25% of assets annually manages the first $10,000 free.\n\nA NYSE trader on Aug. 24, when the \u2018flash crash\u2019 raised questions about ETF pricing. Photo: Brendan McDermid/Reuters\n\nTraditional mutual-fund managers, meanwhile, are looking to ride a new investment vehicle developed by a unit of Eaton Vance \u2014an exchange-traded managed fund that will trade all day like a stock but won\u2019t have to fully disclose its portfolio like other actively managed ETFs\u2014to sustain interest in their investment strategies. Similarly, other issuers of index ETFs, including BlackRock, State Street Corp. \u2019s State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard Group, are looking at ways to reintroduce ETF-inclined investors to active strategies.\n\n\u201cInvestors will ultimately embrace them only if they are convinced of the incremental value versus some of the technicalities,\u201d says McKinsey\u2019s Mr. Erzan.\n\nSo far, it has all been a tough sell.\n\nMr. Weinberg is a writer in New York.

To avoid this trap, people should be careful about how they pay those education costs.\n\nHere are answers to some of the questions that readers raised:\n\nAre education tax benefits available to grandparents?\n\nGenerally, to claim the American Opportunity credit, Lifetime Learning credit or tuition-and-fees deduction, the student must be a dependent on your tax return (or the student can be you or your spouse).\n\nGrandparents and parents who have started 529 plans for students should note that the prohibition against \u201cdouble dipping\u201d of tax benefits applies across all taxpayers footing a student\u2019s education bill, meaning only one taxpayer is allowed to claim a tax benefit for a specific education expense. So if a grandparent withdraws $4,000 from a 529 to help pay for a student\u2019s tuition, that same expenditure can\u2019t be used by the student\u2019s parent to qualify for, say, the American Opportunity Tax Credit.\n\n\u201cThe ban on double dipping applies even if the qualified expenses were paid by other people,\u201d says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Edvisors.com, a consumer-information website based in Las Vegas.\n\nAsk Us a Question Have a question about 529 college-savings plans? We\u2019ll be answering them in future funds reports. Send them to reports@wsj.com.\n\nIf you\u2019re a grandparent who has funded a 529 college-savings plan for your grandchild, note that another complexity arises once the student starts school. Some schools may count that grandparents\u2019 account as a student asset, and most will count a distribution from that account as student income, thus potentially reducing the student\u2019s eligibility for need-based financial aid.\n\nThere are ways to avoid this problem. For example, in some cases, you could delay distributions from a grandparent\u2019s 529 account until after the student has filed the last financial-aid application of his or her college career.\n\nIs the contributions portion of a 529 withdrawal eligible for other education tax benefits?\n\nContributions to 529 plans are made after-tax\u2014the tax benefit applies only to the earnings. Thus, a reader writes: \u201cWouldn\u2019t the contributions portion of a 529 withdrawal be eligible for the American Opportunity tax credit?\u201d\n\nIf only. The statutory language doesn\u2019t allow it, Mr. Kantrowitz says. \u201cThis is not like a Roth IRA where the law differentiates between the earnings and contribution part of a distribution,\u201d he says. \u201cThe tax-free treatment of the earnings portion of a qualified 529 plan distribution is based on the total 529 plan distribution.\u201d\n\nOthers agree. The ban on double-dipping of tax benefits applies to the full 529 distribution, says Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst with Wolters Kluwer Tax and Accounting U.S., in Riverwoods, Ill.\n\nThe good news is that if you do end up double-dipping, you won\u2019t get socked with a penalty, Mr. Luscombe says. Say you pay college costs with 529-plan money and then claim another education tax benefit for those same expenses. The 529 distribution is considered \u201cexcess distribution,\u201d and normally excess 529 distributions are subject to taxes and a 10% penalty. Not so in this case.\n\n\u201cIf an excess distribution from a 529 plan results from also claiming an education credit, the additional 10% penalty that normally applies to excess distributions from a 529 plan is waived,\u201d Mr. Luscombe says. You\u2019re still subject to tax on the earnings portion of that distribution.\n\nAre computers an eligible expense under 529 plans or any education tax benefit?\n\nThat question exemplifies the frustrating ambiguity of the tax code. Computers are an eligible expense for a 529-plan distribution if they\u2019re \u201crequired for enrollment or attendance,\u201d Mr. Luscombe says.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nWhat exactly does \u201crequired\u201d mean? Most schools seem to expect students to have a computer. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a requirement.\n\nIn practice, Mr. Luscombe says, the IRS language appears to mean that the college admission or course requirements say in writing that a computer is required. \u201cIf a college simply stated that a student is likely to need a computer to be an effective student but that it isn\u2019t mandatory, I do not believe that would be enough.\u201d\n\nThe law could change. The House of Representatives in February passed H.R. 529, which would permit computers, technology equipment, software and Internet access as qualified 529-plan expenses, Mr. Luscombe says. \u201cThe bill probably generally has bipartisan support but could still stall in the Senate over issues of revenue offsets and whether it should be combined with other tax provisions,\u201d he says.\n\nThe American Opportunity Credit, Lifetime Learning Credit and tuition-and-fees deduction have rules similar to those for 529 plans, Mr. Luscombe says. \u201cThe computer must be required for coursework,\u201d he says.\n\nCoverdell Education Savings Accounts, meanwhile, have a broader allowance for computers for elementary and secondary education. The rules for those accounts \u201cdo include computer technology and equipment and Internet access as long as the software is not designed for sports, games or hobbies, unless the nature of the software is predominantly educational,\u201d Mr. Luscombe says. But for college students, the rule for Coverdell accounts changes to become \u201cnarrower and similar to that for 529 plans,\u201d Mr. Luscombe says.\n\nFor more on education tax benefits, go to IRS.gov, search \u201ceducation benefits\u201d and click on \u201cTax Benefits for Education: Information Center.\u201d\n\nMs. Coombes is a writer in San Francisco.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-people-dont-buy-long-term-care-insurance-1433951495", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Photo: Getty Images\n\nWhen it comes to long-term care, two facts stand out. First, an estimated 70% of people will need such care, which will be costly. And second, most of them refuse to buy insurance to cover it.\n\nThe question is, why?\n\nPart of the explanation, no doubt, is that long-term-care insurance is expensive. Some people also may be assuming, incorrectly, that they will qualify for government assistance to help them pay for nursing-home care. Rules are in place to disqualify many who won\u2019t meet the strict conditions required.\n\nBut our research suggests that a deeper problem may be that consumers are looking at long-term-care policies in the wrong way; and, just as important, that insurers may be missing opportunities to tweak their products in ways that might address and overcome some of the root causes of those misunderstandings.\n\nFor instance, in a study we conducted recently, we found that many people regard long-term-care insurance as having no real value if ultimately the payouts aren\u2019t needed. That is, instead of looking at long-term-care insurance primarily as financial protection, many people think of it as an investment\u2014and a bad one at that. They see the premiums as money that would be wasted if the policy owner ultimately doesn\u2019t need long-term care. They don\u2019t think about the catastrophic losses a policy could help them avoid.\n\nMoreover, our research suggests that some consumers\u2019 rejection of long-term-care insurance is based on what psychologists call \u201cnarrow framing,\u201d or people\u2019s tendency to exclude key factors when making decisions. Narrow framing has been found to be common when individuals face complicated decisions\u2014and shopping for long-term-care insurance is certainly one of those instances.\n\nIn our study, we looked at a subset of 1,900 respondents in the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative survey of Americans over the age of 50. Based on their answers, we classified respondents according to how likely they were to be narrow framers. We then looked at whether narrow framers had different amounts of long-term-care insurance.\n\nWe found that narrow framers were much less likely to have long-term-care insurance, compared with the average person. Specifically, narrow framers were only half as likely to buy such insurance\u2014a gap that persists regardless of respondents\u2019 health status, risk tolerance, marital status and wealth.\n\nWhile our findings suggest that long-term-care-insurance providers are up against some deep-seated consumer attitudes, we believe that insurers could better position their products in the marketplace by providing more information to consumers regarding the high probability of needing care, and the high costs of such care.\n\nInsurers also could focus more marketing toward adult children whose parents will likely require nursing-home care, since the children are often aware of (and concerned about) the costs and benefits that insurance can provide.\n\nAnother approach would be for insurers to emphasize policies that provide benefits in addition to protection for long-term-care costs. For example, more policies could include retirement income payouts or life insurance\u2014as some insurers already do offer.\n\nWhile adding such features does make long-term-care policies more expensive, they help alleviate concerns about policies being worthless if long-term care were not needed. In fact, many life-insurance companies already take this tack by including a savings component that pays out should the policy owner outlive the policy.\n\nDr. Mitchell is a professor of insurance and risk management, as well as business economics and public policy at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/battle-continues-over-fiduciary-rule-for-retirement-investments-1434054916", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Photo: Christine Glade/Getty Images\n\nOf all the regulatory battles in Washington, one in particular could affect the retirement savings of millions of investors for years to come.\n\nAt the center of the conflict is a proposal by the Department of Labor that it says offers a new level of protection for investors in their dealings with brokers and other financial professionals who give advice on retirement accounts and defined-benefit plans. The proposal would require these professionals to always act in the best interest of their clients. The so-called best-interest standard is known as a fiduciary duty.\n\nFinancial advisers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission already are held to this standard. But brokers for the most part are held to a standard of \u201csuitability,\u201d which requires them to reasonably believe that any investment recommendation they give is suitable for an investor\u2019s objectives, means and age.\n\nConsumer advocates say that because of the lack of a fiduciary standard, stock brokerages, insurance firms and other financial-service providers for years have recommended investment products that line their own pockets with fees and commissions instead of giving customers options that could be less expensive and provide better returns for their retirement savings. The fiduciary proposal, these consumer advocates say, would close regulatory loopholes that make such behavior possible.\n\nReliance on professionals\n\n\u201cAs a matter of policy, we have chosen to put the responsibility for saving for retirement on individuals who don\u2019t have the financial sophistication to make sound investment decisions on their own,\u201d says Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit in Washington, D.C. \u201cThey rely on financial professionals to help them with these decisions, and they desperately need advisers who serve their best interest.\u201d\n\nIf adopted, the proposal would have a big impact on large parts of the financial-services industry, particularly brokers and insurance agents who sell retirement products. In addition to affecting product recommendations, it would require that professionals act in clients\u2019 best interest when offering advice on distributions from retirement plans and the investment of assets to be rolled over or distributed from plans or IRAs.\n\nThe proposal also would help clarify the advisory landscape for investors who are confused by stockbrokers who call themselves advisers but who needn\u2019t act in their clients\u2019 best interest, backers of the proposal say.\n\nThe Labor Department says a review of academic literature provided by the White House Council of Economic Advisers suggests that advice from professionals who have a financial incentive to put investors in a specific product takes a $17 billion bite out of the retirement savings of working- and middle-class families each year. Such conflicts of interest in the mutual-fund segment alone could cost IRA investors more than $210 billion over the next 10 years and nearly $500 billion over the next 20 years, the department says.\n\nThe financial-services industry disputes those figures. The research \u201cis seriously flawed as it used a model\u2026that is not supported by the research it cites as the basis for its argument,\u201d says Kenneth Bentsen Jr., president and chief executive of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or Sifma, whose members include broker-dealers, banks and asset managers.\n\nMoreover, Sifma and other financial-services firms say the proposed fiduciary rule is unworkable. Sifma claims the vast majority of IRAs, for example, are held in commission brokerage accounts. As a result, it says, the proposal would expose such firms and advisers to a new legal liability. Opponents of the rule also say it would limit investor choice and burden investors and firms with onerous paperwork to comply with the new regulations.\n\nJuli McNeely, president of the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, for example, says the contracts required for stockbrokers under the proposal would be cumbersome and possibly intimidating to many clients. Additional paperwork, she says, can ask for personal information that makes clients feel they need to seek legal or other advice. Such contracts also would add expense and liability for advisers, Ms. McNeely says.\n\nHarold Evensky, chairman of Evensky & Katz/Foldes Financial Wealth Management in Coral Gables, Fla., says the fiduciary proposal would likely substantially change the outcome of many arbitration cases involving brokers. \u201cThe brokerage industry sees that, which is the reason they\u2019re fighting so strongly against it,\u201d says Mr. Evensky, who is also a professor of practice in personal financial planning at Texas Tech University.\n\nMove to fee-based accounts?\n\nBecause of increased liability risks and compliance costs, Sifma says that some of its members have indicated that their safer course of action would be to migrate most commission-based accounts to fee-based accounts. But fee-based accounts cost the investor more than commission brokerage accounts, it says.\n\nSupporters of the fiduciary proposal dispute this. The consumer advocate Ms. Roper says that brokerage accounts can be cheaper, but that this is not always the case. For example, if a broker puts a client in a mutual fund\u2019s C shares, which typically charge annual sales charges, that client could end up paying as much for that one-time service as someone in a fee-based account pays for comprehensive financial planning and ongoing asset management, she says.\n\nSome opponents of the Labor proposal say they aren\u2019t against a best-interest standard. The Financial Services Roundtable, a trade association for America\u2019s largest banks, recognizes it is important for retail customers to receive retirement advice from those who put their best interest first, says Felicia Smith, the association\u2019s senior regulatory counsel for regulatory affairs. But, Ms. Smith says, her group thinks there are more appropriate ways to obtain that goal than the \u201cfairly cumbersome\u201d and \u201cunworkable\u201d proposal from Labor.\n\nBoth the roundtable and Sifma have proposed their own best-interests standards. Sifma, for its part, says it wants a standard that applies \u201cacross all investment recommendations made to individual retail customers in all brokerage accounts,\u201d and not just to retirement accounts.\n\nMs. Roper says both counterproposals come up short. Sifma\u2019s proposal, for one, suggests managing conflicts primarily by disclosing them and obtaining client consent, she says. \u201cIf you tell advisers that they have to act in the customer\u2019s best interest,\u201d Ms. Roper says, \u201cbut you still pay or reward them for acting against their customer\u2019s best interest, disclosing you have a conflict isn\u2019t going to solve that problem.\u201d\n\nMs. Maxey is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

This bizarre situation has sparked reader questions about the fate of \u201cextenders\u201d legislation, Washington shorthand for legislation to extend the life of numerous tax laws that died at the end of last year.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at three tax breaks that may or may not be revived for 2015 and what it all means for taxpayers.\n\nIRA donations to charities\n\nAmong the expired provisions that have sparked reader interest is one that encouraged many taxpayers to donate directly to charities from their individual retirement accounts. Charitable organizations loved this provision. They said it helped bring in large amounts of donations that might not otherwise have been made.\n\nHere\u2019s how it worked for the 2014 tax year: Taxpayers who were 70\u00bd or older typically could transfer as much as $100,000 directly from an IRA to a qualified charity without having to include any of that money as income. Done properly, such transfers, known as qualified charitable distributions, counted toward the taxpayer\u2019s minimum required IRA distribution for the year.\n\nBob Farney, a reader from Evansville, Ind., writes to ask whether this now-deceased law has been \u201cre-approved\u201d for 2015. If not, he asks, \u201chow can a person plan for doing this? Having to possibly wait until December for Congress to re-approve (as happened last year for the 2014 tax year) is pretty risky.\u201d\n\nAnswer: No, the law hasn\u2019t been resurrected, says Greg Rosica, a tax partner at Ernst & Young and a contributing author to the EY Tax Guide. But most tax experts I have spoken to predict Congress probably will approve an extenders bill later this year that will include this provision, among others.\n\n\u201cSince these provisions are popular and impact many taxpayers, there is interest in continuing these provisions,\u201d Mr. Rosica says. \u201cHowever, there is a revenue impact to the government that needs to be considered.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on past practice, extending almost everything for another year would be a good bet, but it\u2019s not guaranteed,\u201d says Len Burman, Pozen Director of the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.\n\nTo be on the safe side, \u201ctaxpayers should probably put off taking their required minimum distribution for the year as long as possible to see what action Congress might take,\u201d says Mark Luscombe, principal analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting U.S. in Riverwoods, Ill.\n\nFor more details on how this law worked, including some important twists, see go to irs.gov.\n\nSales-tax deduction\n\nUnder another expired tax provision, taxpayers who filed Form 1040 and itemized their deductions on Schedule A had a choice. They could deduct either their state and local income taxes or their state and local sales taxes, but not both.\n\nThe option to deduct sales taxes has been a big hit in states that don\u2019t have a state income tax, such as Florida, Texas and Washington. But many people in other states chose that option, too. The IRS has estimated, based on preliminary data, that nearly 9.8 million federal income-tax returns claimed sales-tax deductions, totaling more than $16.2 billion, for the 2013 tax year.\n\nHere\u2019s my take: While nothing is sure these days, especially when it comes to taxes, this provision has an exceptionally good chance of being extended, at least through 2015. It has been so popular and affects so many voters that Congress will feel intense pressure to restore it.\n\nUnder the expired provision, taxpayers had a choice of how to calculate their sales-tax deduction. If they kept receipts, they could deduct the total amount of general sales taxes they paid during the year.\n\nIf they didn\u2019t save those receipts or didn\u2019t want to bother with the calculations, they could fill out an IRS work sheet and use the optional general sales-tax tables in the instructions for Schedule A. (They were allowed to add sales taxes on certain big-ticket items, such as a motor vehicle, aircraft or boat.) Or they could use the IRS\u2019s sales-tax-deduction calculator.\n\nThis can be surprisingly tricky, especially for people who moved during the year. See the IRS website for details.\n\nMy advice: If you think you might benefit from this provision for 2015, save your sales-tax receipts, even though that\u2019s a pain and even though it\u2019s still not definite that this provision will be available for 2015. Many people probably will find they will get higher deductions that way than by relying on the IRS tables.\n\nA reader asked whether this provision existed for the 2013 tax year. Answer: Yes. If you didn\u2019t claim the sales-tax deduction for 2013 and want to do so, you can file an amended return using Form 1040X.\n\nEducator-expense deduction\n\nMillions of elementary- and secondary-school educators were eligible to deduct as much as $250 of their out-of-pocket expenses for classroom supplies, such as books and computer equipment, including related software and services, under a provision that has expired.\n\nA friend asked whether this applied only to teachers. No. To qualify, you had to be a teacher, instructor, counselor, principal or aide who worked at least 900 hours in a school year in a school that provides elementary or secondary education, kindergarten through grade 12, based on state law, the IRS said.\n\nThis was an especially attractive break because educators who qualified could claim it whether or not they itemized their deductions. More than 3.9 million returns claimed it for the 2013 tax year, according to IRS estimates.\n\nMr. Herman is a writer in New York City.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-your-emotions-get-in-the-way-of-smart-investing-1434046156", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Illustration: John Kuczala for The wall Street Journal\n\nAsk investors what they want from their investments, and most will say the answer is obvious: They want profits.\n\nTheir answer may be obvious, but it probably isn\u2019t true.\n\nInside all of us are wants we don\u2019t always express or often even are aware of. When we make decisions about our money, we are often looking to satisfy those hidden emotional desires instead of doing what we say we\u2019re doing\u2014seeking out the best return possible.\n\nBut not being aware of these hidden wants can lead us to make potentially devastating errors that can hurt us both emotionally and financially.\n\nFor instance, we may trade stocks constantly\u2014and lose money in the process\u2014because it feels fun, more like a game than sober financial planning. On the other hand, we may refuse to take sensible risks to get a better return because we fear ending up poor. Or we may avoid selling stocks that have plummeted in value because we want to keep alive the hope that they will rebound, and we don\u2019t want to admit defeat.\n\nIt\u2019s important, therefore, to recognize and acknowledge our hidden desires. Doing so can help us make better choices and ultimately achieve the goals we really need.\n\nSo, what are we really looking for? There are three kinds of benefits\u2014utilitarian, expressive and emotional\u2014that we want from all products and services, including financial ones.\n\nUtilitarian benefits are the answer to the question, \u201cWhat does it do for me and my pocketbook?\u201d The utilitarian benefits of a car are in ferrying us from one place to another, and the utilitarian benefits of investments are in increasing our wealth.\n\nExpressive benefits convey to us and to others our values, tastes and status. They answer the question, \u201cWhat does it say about me to others and to me?\u201d A Prius hybrid, like a green-focused mutual fund, expresses environmental responsibility, whereas a stately Bentley, like a hedge fund, expresses high social status. Likewise, diamonds are largely devoid of utilitarian benefits but, among other things, help prospective grooms express their desirability as mates.\n\nEmotional benefits are the answer to the question, \u201cHow does it make me feel?\u201d A Prius and socially responsible mutual funds make us feel virtuous, whereas a Bentley and hedge funds make us feel proud.\n\nTo be sure, there is nothing necessarily wrong with making decisions for expressive and emotional reasons. The key is to be aware of them and to acknowledge that they carry a price\u2014very often, a substantial one\u2014in the form of higher costs or lower returns. We can increase the sum of our benefits if we understand our wants, weigh the trade-offs between them and choose wisely.\n\nHere is a look at some of the things we want, and how to understand the hidden desires behind them.\n\nWe want to play but we also want to beat the market\n\nMany people think they can beat the stock market by making constant moves. They can bring in a better return, they suppose, than people who simply park their money in index funds or other staid vehicles that promise only to match the market.\n\nSome of this stems from a classic error of overconfidence. Many assume that playing the market is like playing tennis against a practice wall\u2014when in fact there is an opponent on the other side of the net, in the form of CEOs who move the market by touting stocks and professional investors who take advantage of those swings. Some amateurs recognize that there are pros playing against them but still think they can win. A survey of amateur traders reveals that 62% expected to beat the market during the following 12 months.\n\nYet we know from many studies that returns of heavy traders, on average, lag behind the returns of light traders, and the returns of light traders, on average, lag behind the returns of those who buy, hold and rarely trade.\n\nWhy do people keep doing it? Trading, like tennis, delivers expressive and emotional benefits. It is fun to play against Novak Djokovic, even if we lose. In one survey, for instance, Dutch investors showed that they cared about the expressive and emotional benefits of investing more than its utilitarian benefits. They tended to agree with the statement \u201cI invest because I like to analyze problems, look for new constructions, and learn\u201d and the statement \u201cI invest because it is a nice free-time activity\u201d more than they did with \u201cI invest because I want to safeguard my retirement.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a survey showed that German investors who find investing enjoyable trade twice as much as other investors. And a quarter of American investors bought stocks as a hobby or because it is something they enjoy.\n\nThe lesson? Don\u2019t kid yourself into thinking\u2014as the studies show\u2014that you can both beat the market (the utilitarian benefits) and get the emotional benefits. The game is more likely to reduce your profits and their utilitarian benefits than add to them. Make sure that you allocate no more than play money to the game, a small amount whose loss wouldn't crash important goals such as retirement income, education and homeownership.\n\nWe want to face no losses\n\nRational investors follow the maxim, \u201cCut your losses and let your profits run.\u201d I, and fellow professors of finance, teach students to recognize the tax benefits of realizing losses and overcome the reluctance to realize them.\n\nSo why do so many investors do the opposite, sell winners too early and ride losers too long? The answer is largely in our desire for the emotional benefits of pride and avoidance of the emotional costs of regret.\n\nBuying a stock marks a hopeful beginning. We place the stock into a mental account, record its $100 purchase price and hope to close the account at a gain, perhaps selling the stock at $150. As fate has it, the stock\u2019s price plummets to $40 during the following month rather than increase to $150. This is only a paper loss, we console ourselves. The stock\u2019s price will surely recover very soon and climb higher. The mental account containing the stock is still open, keeping alive the hope that losses will turn into gains.\n\nWe need not acknowledge our paper losses fully before we realize them, but we face them and they gnaw at us. We feel stupid. Hindsight errors mislead us into thinking that what is clear in hindsight was equally clear in foresight. We bought the stock at $100 because, in foresight, it seemed destined to go to $150. But now, in hindsight, we remember all the warning signs displayed in plain sight on the day we bought our stock. Interest rates were about to increase. The CEO was about to resign. A competitor was ready to introduce a better product.\n\nHindsight is accompanied by the emotional costs of regret. We kick ourselves for being so stupid and contemplate how much happier we would have been if only we had kept our $100 in our savings account or invested it in another stock that zoomed as our stock plummeted. Regret is painful enough when we face our paper losses, but the pain of regret is searing when we realize our losses because this is when we give up hope of getting even by recovering our losses.\n\nPride is at the opposite end of the emotional spectrum from regret. Pride accompanies the realization of gains. We congratulate ourselves and feel proud for seeing in foresight that our $100 stock would soon zoom to $150. Realizing gains by selling our stocks seals our gains and amplifies our pride.\n\nBut the lessons of regret are overly harsh and the lessons of pride too encouraging. Stocks go up and down for many reasons and no reason at all. We need not kick ourselves with regret every time stock prices go down, and we should not stroke ourselves with pride every time they go up. We can overcome our errors and realize our losses.\n\nWe want to pay no taxes\n\n\u201cNowhere on any tax form does it say you can\u2019t be crafty,\u201d winks an advertisement by an investment company, offering tax-free mutual funds and the picture of a smiling man next to a swimming pool. \u201cHow to send less to the IRS,\u201d promises an advertisement by another investment company.\n\nIt is true that few of us like to pay taxes, and we will go to great lengths to avoid them.\n\nTo some extent, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that: High returns are the utilitarian benefits of tax-free funds, since investors who send less to the IRS keep more of their investment returns.\n\nBut tax-free funds and other tax-saving investments have expressive and emotional benefits as well. When we buy these funds, we express ourselves as high-income investors, with status as high as our tax brackets. We express ourselves as smart, savvy, wily and crafty, which is what it takes to avoid taxes. At the same time, we are angry when taxes rob us of personal freedom or when they are wasted by politicians and bureaucrats, so pride at avoiding taxes can be emotionally satisfying on that level as well.\n\nWe dislike taxes so much, in fact, that we are willing to make bad choices to avoid them. In one study, researchers found that people would sooner move to a country where they would save $4,000 in taxes than one where they could save $5,000 in the cost of food.\n\nThis issue comes up constantly in choices we make with our investments. Do you hold a municipal-bond tax-free fund even though your after-tax return would be higher in a taxable account? Do you contribute money to a tax-deferred IRA when you would be better off by contributing to a Roth IRA and paying the tax upfront? Are you tempted by offshore accounts that would save you taxes now but might put you in jail later?\n\nIt is good to be smart about taxes and satisfy our want of low taxes. But it is an error to let the pursuit of the expressive and emotional benefits of low taxes blind us into sacrificing utilitarian benefits of returns and worse. It is better to express our anger over taxes in the voting booth.\n\nWe want to save for tomorrow and spend it today\n\nThe task of planning the sequence of saving and spending over our lifetimes is daunting. Spending temptations are all around us, from necessities such as food and shelter to luxuries such as iPads, expensive automobiles and fancy vacations. We feel good when we spend, satisfying our immediate wants of utilitarian, expressive and emotional benefits. But insufficient self-control in the face of today\u2019s spending wants might mislead us into spending errors, as we let today\u2019s wants overwhelm tomorrow\u2019s wants, leaving us destitute in old age.\n\nNone of this is surprising, of course. It is the story of the grasshopper and the ant. It is the story of so many people today who find themselves unable to afford the retirement they hoped for\u2014or any retirement at all.\n\nBut as obvious as it is, many people don\u2019t understand the emotional wants that trap them. Some mechanisms are available to help keep people on the straight and narrow. Payroll deductions to defined-contribution retirement savings plans such as 401(k)s aid self-control during our working years. We need not fight spending temptation since the money never passes through our hands. Later on, the prospect of penalties bolsters our self-control when we are tempted to withdraw money from our accounts before the age of 59\u00bd.\n\nYet those protections aren\u2019t perfect, and aren\u2019t available to everyone. Careful mental accounting is needed to bolster the self-control necessary to resist spending and promote savings during working years and control spending in retirement so we don\u2019t run out of money before we run out of life. With mental accounting, we place wages, dividends and interest in \u201cincome\u201d mental accounts and distinguish them from \u201ccapital\u201d mental accounts that contain the stocks and bonds themselves. We feel free to spend income, but we prohibit ourselves from ever dipping into capital by selling stocks or bonds and spending the proceeds.\n\nWe hope for riches and want protection from the fear of poverty\n\nThese two related, but conflicting, impulses drive us in very different directions. Hope for riches urges us to invest our entire portfolio in a handful of stocks and lottery tickets. Fear of poverty urges us to invest our entire portfolio in government bonds and hold tight to Social Security.\n\nWe resolve the internal conflict between these two desires by balancing our portfolios between mental accounts devoted to each one. We commit errors when we let one want overwhelm the other.\n\nAn investor with a diversified portfolio who places 2% of his portfolio into a single promising stock or even a lottery ticket might succeed, but he is free of fear of poverty because the rest of his portfolio would sustain him. But a retired person who empties his 401(k) to buy a new kind of franchise likely commits an error, exposing himself to poverty as he reaches for riches, and so does a retired investor who place her entire portfolio in a handful of stocks or the hands of the next Madoff.\n\nAn engineer who quits her steady job to pursue her want of hope for riches in the next Uber is prudent if she possesses the right skills and ideas. She might succeed, satisfying her want of hope for riches, but she commits no error as she is free of fear of poverty even if she fails because her skills and ideas would land her another engineering job.\n\nA young man who lets his want of freedom from the fear of poverty overwhelm his want of hope for riches commits an error as he sticks to a seemingly steady but low-paying job and places his entire portfolio in certificates of deposit. Low pay and low returns are likely to drive him into poverty with no hope for riches.\n\nWe want high social status\n\nWith some investments, we hope for wealth but also for elevated social status. Vehicles such as hedge funds, wine and movies give investors the hope of prestige as well as substantial returns. Mere millionaires are consigned to commercial flights, albeit in first-class cabins, but hedge-fund investors can dream about the exclusive world of private planes that depart at their command. Those who put their money into movie productions look forward to \u201cexecutive producer\u201d credits, awards ceremonies and mingling with actors on the set or at premieres.\n\nYet what few investors realize is that those glamorous investments rarely deliver more prosaic utilitarian goals\u2014and their expressive benefits, if any, are fleeting.\n\nPhoto: ISTOCK\n\nFor instance, we know that markets are beatable by skillful investors such as hedge-fund managers. But individual investors err when they believe that hedge-fund managers would share their winnings with them. A recent four-panel cartoon said it well in the words of a hedge-fund manager:\n\nThe reason I make a billion a year is I\u2019m smarter than everybody.\n\nTrue, my fund didn\u2019t deliver for the investors this year, but I still got a billion dollar bonus.\n\nHow does it prove I\u2019m smarter than everybody?\n\nPretty obvious.\n\nSimply put, investors aren\u2019t going to get the returns they think they are, and dreaming of earning enough to secure a private plane is wildly unrealistic.\n\nMovie accounting, meanwhile, is notorious for its nontransparency, leaving investors on the losing side. How long will you be able to savor the memory of a star-studded cocktail reception if an investor loses all the money he invested? It\u2019s also hard to enjoy the expressive benefits of wine investments when investors\u2019 returns are drained away by high storage and auction fees and other expenses.\n\nIf investors were more aware of why they wanted to put their money in these investments\u2014that they were chasing fleeting, if not illusory, emotional benefits\u2014and that their fantasies typically outweigh the real-world returns, they might think twice about taking the plunge.\n\nDr. Statman is Glenn Klimek professor of finance at Santa Clara University\u2019s Leavey School of Business and the author of \u201cWhat Investors Really Want.\u201d He can be reached at reports@wsj.com.", "date": null, "title": "How Your Emotions Get in the Way of Smart Investing"}

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nAs millennials struggle to repay record levels of student-loan debt, many are making costly mistakes that threaten to undermine their long-term financial security.\n\nFor instance, roughly one in four is behind on repayments or in default, which can result in a host of negative consequences, from damaged credit to garnished wages. Meanwhile, many others are struggling to find enough money, after making their loan payments, to save for retirement. Among 401(k) participants with student debt in plans administered by Fidelity Investments, two-thirds say they have reduced or stopped their 401(k) contributions or have taken out a 401(k) loan or hardship withdrawal.\n\nWith total college-loan debt in the U.S. more than five times what it was just 20 years ago, \u201cthe consequences of managing that debt have never been greater,\u201d says Heather Jarvis, an attorney who teaches financial professionals about student loans.\n\nWhat follows are six student-loan mistakes people commonly make and how you can avoid them.\n\nMISTAKE NO. 1: Failing to consider income-driven repayment plans\n\nWhen it comes to government-backed student loans, many people stick with a \u201cstandard\u201d repayment plan. This default option requires the borrower to make fixed monthly payments for up to 10 years\u2014an approach that often minimizes the interest the borrower will pay over the life of the loan, in comparison to other payment plans, but maximizes monthly payments.\n\nSome borrowers\u2014particularly those who are cash-strapped\u2014may benefit from an income-driven repayment plan. These plans, the newest of which became available last year, cap student-loan repayments at 10% to 15% of a borrower\u2019s annual discretionary income\u2014an amount that is determined by a formula that includes the borrower\u2019s income and family size, among other factors. Using one, a borrower can free up cash for other long-term financial goals, such as saving for retirement.\n\nThey also offer the possibility of loan forgiveness after a set number of years of on-time repayments\u2014from 10 to 25 years, depending on the plan and the borrower\u2019s profession. More on that in Mistake No. 3.\n\nFor those looking to reduce their monthly payments, these options generally are more attractive than older alternatives, including \u201cgraduated\u201d and \u201cextended\u201d plans, says Ms. Jarvis. Graduated plans start with lower payments that increase every two years\u2014and eventually surpass the standard fixed payment. Extended plans lower monthly payments by allowing up to 25 years for repayment.\n\nBorrowers whose debt is two-thirds of their income or more are likely to qualify for at least some of the various income-driven repayment plans, says Mark Kantrowitz, a financial-aid expert and the publisher of Cappex.com, a college scholarship and search site.\n\nBut those who can benefit the most from these plans generally have debt in excess of their income\u2014a threshold at which borrowers are likely to eventually see some of their loan balances forgiven, says Ms. Jarvis.\n\nMISTAKE NO. 2: Failing to understand the loans\n\nThere are two basic types of student loans: federal and private. Interest rates on federal loans are set annually by a formula based on the yield of the 10-year Treasury note. With private loans, banks set interest rates using a borrower\u2019s credit history.\n\nTo understand their repayment options, it\u2019s important for borrowers to compile a list of their loans, including the loan type, principal amount and interest rate. Lenders should have the details or, for federal loans, borrowers can go to the National Student Loan Data System at nslds.ed.gov.\n\nWhy bother? For one thing, borrowers need to know the interest rates on their loans to figure out whether it makes sense to refinance or consolidate what they owe. (With refinancing, a borrower takes out a new private loan to pay off some or all of his or her existing loans, typically at a lower interest rate. With consolidation, the borrower combines some or all existing federal loans at the weighted average interest rate on the old loans. See more on these options in Mistake No. 5.)\n\nIn addition, to understand which income-driven repayment options borrowers are eligible for, they\u2019ll need to know the dates when they borrowed. For example, to use the popular Pay As You Earn (PAYE) method\u2014an income-driven plan that frequently generates the lowest monthly payments and the highest projected loan forgiveness\u2014a borrower can\u2019t have borrowed before Oct. 1, 2007 and must have taken out at least one federal loan on or after Oct. 1, 2011.\n\nTo see what monthly and total payments would be under the various repayment options, borrowers can plug their loan information into the U.S. Education Department\u2019s online Repayment Estimator. Among other things, this tool assumes income will rise 5% a year. If borrowers want to control that and other inputs\u2014such as the number of children they plan to have and information about their spouse\u2014they can use the Student Loan Repayment Simulator sponsored by the nonprofit VIN Foundation for veterinarians.\n\nFor advice, a borrower might consider hiring a financial planner. The XY Planning Network consists of some 290 financial advisers who cater to younger clients. Some have expertise in student loans and charge hourly or project-based fees.\n\nBeware of companies that charge an upfront fee to help student-loan borrowers obtain debt relief, says Ms. Jarvis, adding that some are scams.\n\nMISTAKE NO. 3: Failing to research student-loan forgiveness programs\n\nSome employers\u2014including the U.S. military, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Fidelity Investments\u2014contribute to employees\u2019 student-loan payments.\n\nBorrowers with federal loans who use income-driven repayment plans may also receive partial loan forgiveness.\n\nUnder the Federal government\u2019s Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, teachers, law-enforcement employees, doctors, lawyers and others who work full-time for 10 years for certain types of nonprofits or government are eligible to have their remaining balances forgiven tax-free after 10 years of payments. To ensure they will receive loan forgiveness, they should use an income-driven repayment plan.\n\nFor those not in public-service jobs, loan forgiveness is less generous. To qualify, these borrowers must repay their loans for 20 to 25 years\u2014the exact term depends on which income-driven repayment plan they select. In addition, they must pay income tax on any debt that is canceled\u2014a payment that can amount to as much as one-third or more of the forgiven amount.\n\nMISTAKE NO. 4: Prioritizing student loans at the expense of retirement savings\n\nIn a push to become debt-free, many borrowers prioritize paying off their student loans over saving for retirement.\n\nThat\u2019s a mistake. A recent report from Morningstar Inc. subsidiary HelloWallet found that someone with a starting salary of $50,000 who pays off a $20,000 student loan ahead of schedule but skimps on retirement savings\u2014by contributing only enough to an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan to receive half the employer\u2019s 3% matching contribution\u2014will wind up with a net worth at age 65 that\u2019s $150,000 below where it would have been had he or she contributed enough to receive the full match and repaid the loan over a longer period, by making the minimum required payment.\n\n\u201cThe match is free money,\u201d says Marcio Silveira, a financial adviser in Arlington, Va. If a company offers a 50-cent match for every dollar an employee contributes to a 401(k) plan up to 6% of pay, \u201cit\u2019s a 50% return on your money,\u201d he says. That\u2019s far higher than the return on paying off a student loan, which is equivalent to the loan\u2019s interest rate.\n\nIf payments under a 10-year standard repayment plan leave a borrower too cash-strapped to get an employer\u2019s full matching contribution and the employee doesn\u2019t have room to cut spending, he or she might consider an income-driven repayment plan, says Jake Spiegel, a senior research analyst at HelloWallet.\n\nHis advice: Borrowers should use the cash they free up to set aside at least three months of expenses in an emergency fund. Then, they can save enough in their 401(k) plan to receive their employer\u2019s full matching contribution. Their next priority should be to pay down any high-interest credit-card debt they owe. And if choosing an income-driven plan means they\u2019re likely to incur a tax on debt forgiveness, they should save a little each month to cover the projected tab.\n\nAnything left over should go into a retirement plan, says Mr. Spiegel.\n\nWhy? People are likely to earn a higher return in stocks and bonds\u2014that will compound for decades\u2014than they would by extinguishing student-loan debt at today\u2019s low interest rates, he says. In addition, the more a person contributes to a traditional 401(k) plan, the lower his or her adjusted gross income will be. This will help reduce income-driven student-loan payments the next year, says Daniel Wrenne, a financial adviser in Lexington, Ky.\n\nMISTAKE NO. 5: Automatically refinancing or consolidating\n\nIf people with student loans have private loans with high interest rates, they should look into refinancing. Online lenders including Social Finance Inc., CommonBond Inc., and First Republic Bank frequently offer attractive deals to those with healthy credit scores and good prospects for future earnings, among other factors, says Mr. Wrenne.\n\nBorrowers can refinance their federal loans, too, but they should be careful, weighing any interest-rate reduction they receive against the benefits they\u2019ll lose by swapping their federal loans for private loans. These include the flexibility to suspend their payments if they become unemployed or to use an income-driven repayment plan.\n\nThe decision to consolidate also requires analysis. Consolidation makes it easier to keep track of and repay student debt. It also allows borrowers to swap loans issued under the discontinued Federal Family Education Loan program for a new Federal Direct loan\u2014a prerequisite to using certain income-driven repayment plans.\n\nBut borrowers who consolidate all their loans lose the flexibility to pay off the ones with the highest interest rates first. Borrowers who want to maintain that flexibility don\u2019t have to consolidate all of their loans, says Ms. Jarvis.\n\nMISTAKE NO. 6: Failing to automate payments\n\nTo ensure they won\u2019t be late with their loan payments\u2014a misstep that can wreak havoc with credit scores and push back the date at which one becomes eligible for debt forgiveness\u2014borrowers should automate all of their loan payments. Many lenders offer those who do so a reduction of a quarter to half a percentage point in their interest rates, says Mr. Kantrowitz.\n\nAdvisers suggest that people automate their savings, too, including contributions to 401(k) plans and emergency savings. If they are in an income-driven repayment plan that will generate a tax bill on forgiven debt, they should start saving for that, as well.\n\nTo keep tax savings on track, Alan Moore, a financial planner in Nashville, Tenn., suggests segregating this money in a separate investment account.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t save enough money for the tax bill, all you are accomplishing is swapping your student-loan debt for a debt to the IRS,\u201d he says, adding that savings earmarked for the tax payment shouldn\u2019t be invested too heavily in stocks due to the risk of a bear market.\n\nMs. Tergesen is a Wall Street Journal reporter in New York.

Photo: Esteban Pulido\n\nSix years ago, Andy Anderegg \u2019s decision to major in English looked like an economic sacrifice. When she left academia in 2010, with a master\u2019s degree in fine arts from the University of Kansas, the first job she landed was a Groupon Inc. writing gig paying all of $33,000 a year.\n\nNow, however, Ms. Anderegg is riding high. She rose rapidly as Groupon expanded, becoming managing editor of the shopping-coupon site in 2012; by the time she left in 2014, she was earning more than $100,000. Today, at age 30, she is executive editor at Soda Media Inc., a Seattle creator of online content, and building up her own digital-media consulting practice. She won\u2019t disclose her aggregate income but says: \u201cIt\u2019s better than what I made at Groupon.\u201d\n\nMs. Anderegg\u2019s delayed payoff is part of a little-noticed bright spot in the earnings picture for humanities and social-sciences majors. It\u2019s no secret that liberal-arts graduates tend to fare worse than many of their counterparts immediately after college: According to PayScale Inc., a Seattle-based provider of salary data, the typical English or sociology graduate with zero to five years of experience earns an average of just $39,000 a year. By contrast, finance majors with that level of experience average $52,000; nursing, $57,000, and computer science, $63,000.\n\nThe story tends to change, however, as careers play out. Over time, liberal-arts majors often pursue graduate degrees and gravitate into high-paying fields such as general management, politics, law and sales, according to an analysis by the Association of American Colleges & Universities, a trade group representing more than 1,350 schools. Once people reach their peak-earnings ages of 56 to 60, liberal-arts majors are earning an average $66,185, the association found. That\u2019s about 3% ahead of the earnings pace for people with degrees in vocational fields such as nursing and accounting, though it remains more than 20% behind science and engineering majors.\n\nUltrahigh earners\n\nEven more striking, however, are earnings trends for ultrahigh achievers across all majors.\n\nUsing Census Bureau data, the Brookings Institution\u2019s Hamilton Project analyzed lifetime earnings for each discipline\u2019s top 10% of moneymakers. It found that computer science\u2019s stars rang up lifetime earnings of at least $3.2 million. Nice work, but not as impressive as philosophy majors\u2019 $3.46 million or history majors\u2019 $3.75 million.\n\nConsider the executive leadership team at Seattle\u2019s Zillow Group Inc. The real-estate data firm\u2019s chief executive, Spencer Rascoff, chose a government and economics concentration at Harvard University. Chief Financial Officer Kathleen Philips studied political science at the University of California, Berkeley. Chief economist, Stan Humphries, earned a bachelor of arts in interdisciplinary studies from North Carolina\u2019s Davidson College.\n\nLast year, Mr. Rascoff, Ms. Philips and Mr. Humphries each earned at least $7 million in salary, bonus or stock options, according to Zillow\u2019s proxy statement. Mr. Humphries took the most roundabout route of the three; after graduating from college, he taught high-school science in Africa for the Peace Corps before eventually earning a Ph.D. in government from the University of Virginia.\n\n\u201cCollege shouldn\u2019t prepare you for your first job, but for the rest of your life,\u201d says John Kroger, president of Reed College in Oregon, the liberal-arts school that famously served as a starting point for Steve Jobs. Although Mr. Jobs dropped out of Reed in the early 1970s, the Apple Inc. founder often credited the school with stretching his horizons in areas such as calligraphy, which later influenced Apple\u2019s design ethos.\n\nTraits that matter\n\nIn the short-term, employers still say they prefer college graduates with career-tailored majors. A recent survey of 180 companies by the National Association of Colleges and Employers found that at least 68% want to hire candidates who majored in business or engineering. By contrast, only 24% explicitly want communications majors, 21% want social-sciences majors and 10% humanities majors.\n\nWhen asked to define the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 traits that matter most, however, the NACE-surveyed employers rated technical skills 10th. Four of the top five traits were hallmarks of a traditional liberal-arts education: teamwork, clear writing, problem-solving aptitude and strong oral communications. Mindful of those longer-term needs, some employers end up hiring humanities and social-sciences graduates, even if such majors aren\u2019t explicitly singled out when recruiting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to hire people who can write\u2014and teach them how to read financial statements\u2014rather than hire accountants in hopes of teaching them to be strong writers,\u201d says Liz Kirschner, head of talent acquisition at Morningstar Inc., a Chicago investment-research firm. Since its founding in 1986, Morningstar has hired an unusually large number of humanities and social-sciences majors.\n\nOne of them is Alec Lucas, a philosophy and classics major who earned a Ph.D. in theology, expecting to make a decent living in either ministry or teaching.\n\n\u201cThe best job offer I could find involved being a visiting professor, teaching four classes per term and getting paid call-center wages with no health insurance,\u201d Mr. Lucas recalls. Morningstar snapped him up at roughly triple the divinity-school\u2019s pay package, and put him to work as a mutual-fund analyst. His longtime side interest in investment helped him find his footing; now he is Morningstar\u2019s expert on more than a dozen well-known equity-strategy funds.\n\nBroad thinkers\n\nAlice Harra, associate dean of students at Reed, says recent graduates of the college are landing hundreds of jobs with tech companies that value a liberal-arts ethos. Others have created startups such as Urban Airship, Puppet Inc. and Inspiration Software, she says.\n\n\u201cI love hiring liberal-arts graduates,\u201d says Dave Elkington, founder and chief executive of InsideSales.com, a Provo, Utah, company specializing in customer-data analysis. \u201cThey think broadly and communicate effectively. They aren\u2019t stuck in a rut. They can challenge ideas.\u201d Mr. Elkington, a philosophy major himself, says he came up with a lot of the ideas for his company\u2019s analytic tools by reflecting on Aristotle\u2019s classifications of knowledge.\n\nMr. Elkington isn\u2019t the only one who values liberal-arts degrees. Last year, LinkedIn data scientist Alice Ma analyzed the career paths of people who graduated from college between 2010 and 2013. Within that sample, she found that about 10% of all liberal-arts majors headed into tech-sector jobs. The figure jumped to 14% when she narrowed the list to 40 top-ranked schools, such as Harvard, Amherst College and Stanford University.\n\nLiberal-arts graduates were most likely to join tech companies to work in sales (11.8%), marketing (5.2%) and project management or business strategy (5.1%), she says. Other common specializations included customer service, corporate communications and human resources.\n\nNot every liberal-arts degree is equally likely to translate into at a midcareer income boost. PayScale\u2019s data shows that for people with 10 to 20 years of experience, degrees in communications, political science, history and philosophy yield average annual income of $70,000 or more. By contrast, degrees in French, anthropology, creative writing and film fit into a band of $60,000 to $69,000. Fields such as theology, photography and music bring up the rear; they pay less than $60,000 on average.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications:\n\nStan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow Group Inc., earned a Ph.D. from the University of Virginia.

Which chocolate do you choose to eat first? Did you eat your favorite one first, or did you save it for the end? Your answer could tell you something important about how to draw down your assets in retirement. Illustration: John Kuczala for The Wall Street Journal\n\nWhen I came back from a trip recently, I surprised my 6-year-old daughter with a box of chocolate truffles. In return, she surprised me with an insight into retirement planning\u2014and why we\u2019re doing it all wrong.\n\nMaya inspected the truffles and announced that, since she could only have one every night, she was going to start with the white chocolate, \u201cbecause I like it the least. That way I can save the best one for last.\u201d Maya then went on to observe that other children might have different preferences, and choose to start with their favorite truffle instead.\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty reasonable\u2014and sophisticated\u2014approach for a child confronted by a box of delicious chocolate. But what does this have to do with retirement planning?\n\nObviously, retirement planning is far more complicated than choosing which chocolate to eat. Yet, they do have something important in common: in both instances, we\u2019re trying to maximize the pleasure of a scarce resource.\n\nFor Maya, this meant structuring the experience of eating her chocolates, so that the pleasure gradually increased over time. In retirement, of course, the scarce resource is money. And though we may not realize it consciously, many of us feel the same way about money that Maya does about chocolates.\n\nResearch shows that people feel happier when the rewards they get change over time\u2014in most cases, when the rewards start low and get progressively higher. Yet most retirement plans are set up to give us the same amount of money every month, year after year. This is the equivalent of having the same truffle every day, without the option to eventually get ones that you like more.\n\nThese are supposed to be the golden years, a time for cruises and grandchildren, but due to a mistaken assumption of accounting, we\u2019ve failed to maximize the pleasure we get out of them. By offering people alternative structures for drawing down their retirement savings, we can increase its impact.\n\nTo be clear: It\u2019s not about making do with less. It\u2019s about finding ways to enjoy what we have even more.\n\nAnticipation brings joy\n\nThe typical American life goes something like this. We spend the first third accumulating human capital\u2014we go to school, learn various skills, develop our talents. The next third is about the accumulation of financial capital. We buy a house, fill it with stuff and save money for the future. Then comes the final third of life, or the drawdown, as we spend what we\u2019ve saved in retirement. This is the grown-up equivalent of eating our chocolates.\n\nYet when designing an income plan for retirement, we fail to consider Maya\u2019s insight into truffles. Instead, we offer people plans that distribute the same amount of money every month. Put another way, the shape of their drawdown plan is a flat line.\n\nHowever, as Maya knew, this approach can limit the pleasure we get from our money. The behavioral science behind this idea comes from Christopher Hsee of the University of Chicago\u2014in particular, his work on hedonomics, which is the application of economic principles to the study of happiness.\n\nIn one paper, Prof. Hsee and co-author Robert P. Abelson showed that our satisfaction with a given outcome\u2014and it didn\u2019t matter if it was a student\u2019s grades or the result of a series of gambles\u2014depended largely on the velocity of change, not just the final position. Although we fixate on the quantity of a particular reward\u2014how much money or chocolates we have\u2014what makes us feel best is when things are getting better, not when we have the most. As Prof. Hsee puts it, \u201cpeople adapt to states but react to changes.\u201d\n\nThis research has big implications for the distribution of rewards. Instead of making us happy, the flat drawdown that most retirement plans offer has a numbing effect, generating smaller amounts of pleasure over time.\n\nIn informal surveys of what drawdown strategy financial advisers would prefer for themselves, I found that the least popular drawdown approach, by far, is the flat line. In contrast, the most popular alternative drawdown method is the upward slope, or increasing income over time. This is analogous to Maya saving the best chocolate for last.\n\nSuch a plan might be especially useful for people who are worried about running out of money, perhaps because they expect to live a very long time. The upward slope would allow these retirees to turn their anxieties into a drawdown strategy with potential hedonic benefits. Instead of worrying about not having enough, they can enjoy the expectation of better times ahead.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, though, that for roughly a third of individuals, the downward slope is more appealing. These people want to eat their best chocolates first.\n\nAlthough this strategy might seem less prudent\u2014it increases our risk of running out of money\u2014it\u2019s a logical approach if you\u2019re worried about not being able to enjoy your savings later in life, typically because of health issues or fear of an early death. Is it better to go on a safari before your hips start to give out? Why save our biggest retirement payouts for our sickest years? Life is short and uncertain; if you end up dying early, you might not even enjoy your best chocolate, so you might as well eat it now.\n\nThese gradually increasing, or decreasing, spending plans are not the only ways to draw down a resource. Consider those chocolate truffles: Although Maya was limited to one truffle every night, she\u2019s allowed to indulge her sweet tooth on special occasions, such as Halloween. I refer to this as the \u201cspike\u201d approach, and it could be easily applied to retirement as well.\n\nInstead of gorging on candy, people would receive larger sums of money at various intervals, before resuming their regular payment schedule.\n\nFor instance, clients might enjoy a \u201cluxury summer,\u201d featuring higher levels of spending that allow them to travel around the world first class. Although very few financial plans offer such a feature, people seem to know they\u2019d like it. According to a survey by researchers at Harvard Business School, a majority of people want a retirement distribution featuring a \u201cbonus month\u201d every year.\n\nThis method provides an important psychological benefit. Because the higher drawdowns are a special treat, we never adapt to the elevated level of consumption. The luxury summer feels like a special reward, the grown-up version of the extra candy that Maya gets on occasion.\n\nKnowing what we want\n\nOf course, once we start allowing people to deviate from the flatline drawdown plan, we need to help them make the right choice. This again brings us back to those chocolate truffles. While much research remains, I think it\u2019s possible that asking people how they\u2019d structure everyday pleasures could uncover important preferences relevant to our retirement, allowing us to predict which drawdown structures will leave us happiest. By discovering who we are, we can learn what we really want.\n\nWhen the Social Security Act was enacted, in 1935, it wasn\u2019t technologically possible to personalize the payouts of each individual. However, the digital age turns mass personalization into a trivial problem. Just as Netflix and Amazon tailor their recommendations based on our individual preferences, so could the government, or an insurance company, customize our retirement payouts to suit our drawdown preferences. Digital technology could be used to refine these recommendations based on constant feedback.\n\nFor instance, if a client has started piling medical expenses on his credit cards, then his drawdown slope could be adjusted to increase his available cash. Or perhaps a client has become less mobile, at least as measured by her smartphone usage. She might benefit from a bonus month so she can take her grandchildren to Disneyland before her arthritis gets worse.\n\nThe digital tools underlying these proposals are already being used to improve our online lives in other domains, from book recommendations to suggested television shows. It\u2019s time for the financial-services industry to play catch up.\n\nToo often, we obsess over getting more of what we want: more money, more friends, more chocolates. But the unfortunate truth is that we will never have enough.\n\nThat\u2019s why I think it\u2019s time to adopt a different approach, applying the lessons of behavioral economics to our mature years. Instead of seeking ever larger rewards\u2014an approach that comes with diminishing returns\u2014I want to figure out how to squeeze more happiness from what we already have.\n\nDr. Benartzi, a frequent contributor to the Journal Reports, is a professor and co-head of the behavioral decision-making group at UCLA Anderson School of Management and author of \u201cThe Smarter Screen\u201d about online behavior.

Some of the holdings in the fund (symbol COPLX) have been around almost as long as the fund itself, and Mr. Levine describes his management strategy, like his tennis game, as \u201csteady, involving no gambling or big risk-taking, and doing what ought to be done carefully.\u201d\n\nCopley Fund\u2019s win, with a 20.67% gain for the past 12 months, marks the second quarter in a row that dividend-paying stocks have ended up in the spotlight in the contest. The five diversified U.S.-stock funds that turned in the best performance over the past 12 months all devote themselves to picking stocks that can pay hefty dividends, rather than those that can generate big capital gains or earnings growth.\n\nAs usual, every diversified U.S.-stock fund that has at least $50 million in assets and a record of more than three years is eligible for the contest, as long as it is actively managed. Index funds and exchange-traded funds don\u2019t count; neither do sector funds, nor hybrid funds that generate returns from a combination of debt and equity. Leveraged funds don\u2019t qualify, since that leverage can distort their returns.\n\nWhat\u2019s not so usual is the identity of this quarter\u2019s winner. Mr. Levine is more likely to make the pages of his hometown newspaper, the Herald News of Fall River, Mass., for his tennis prowess than for his investment accomplishments. Moreover, he came late to investing. By the time he launched Copley Fund, in 1978, he had already started and sold one business\u2014manufacturing women\u2019s handbags\u2014and had \u201cretired\u201d once, in 1965.\n\nBut he had already acquired a taste for investing, having realized in the 1950s that he would never acquire wealth simply by collecting a salary.\n\n\u2018I got stock in Haloid, which became Xerox, and Polaroid, and IBM\u2014the growth stocks of their day.\u2019 \u2014Irving Levine on how he got his start\n\n\u201cI saved up $25,000 and went to see Studley Shupert, a firm that at the time managed about $1 billion for clients in Boston and $2 billion in Philadelphia,\u201d Mr. Levine recalls. The firm\u2019s usual minimum for new clients was $100,000 but Mr. Levine persuaded them to take him on as a client, arguing that he would be accumulating assets steadily to add to his portfolio. \u201cI got stock in Haloid, which became Xerox, and Polaroid, and IBM\u2014the growth stocks of their day.\u201d\n\nMr. Levine\u2019s stock-picking prowess impressed Studley Shupert\u2019s executives enough that they recruited him as an investment manager. In turn, he persuaded them to launch the firm\u2019s first no-load fund. \u201cWe ran it for a number of years, until it was bought by an insurance company,\u201d he says.\n\nThen, in the mid-1970s, Mr. Levine decided to launch his own independent fund. The goal, he decided, would be to never distribute the holdings or profits; rather, if investors wanted to capture any gains, they would have to sell shares. Essentially, he created a mutual-fund version of Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway holding company, only instead of an operating company, it\u2019s an investment firm. Like Mr. Buffett\u2019s share price, Copley Fund\u2019s net asset value per share has soared in the years since its launch, from about $3 to more than $81 today.\n\nThe fund\u2019s 20.67% gain put it more than half a percentage point ahead of the runner-up in the contest. Accustomed to defeating younger rivals on the court, in this competition he beat 50-year-old David Abella, manager of the New York-based City National Rochdale Dividend & Income Fund (RIMHX), a $225 million fund also devoted to dividend investing.\n\nThe two men take similar approaches to investing, hunting for solid companies in a position to increase dividend payouts. The biggest difference between them is that Mr. Levine hardly ever trades. The last time he added a new stock to his portfolio, he calculates, was two years ago, when he bought Kimberly-Clark for about $60 a share. (It now trades at about $137 a share.)\n\nSome of his fixtures have seen enormous changes, not only in their industries but in their holdings. \u201cAll of my oil companies have merged into only two stocks; when deregulation broke up AT&T, I bought all those businesses, and now it\u2019s back to only two telecom companies again,\u201d he says.\n\nThose long-term holdings have created some headaches for him. Although he has succession plans (if he can\u2019t manage the funds, one of two institutions will take his place), the Securities and Exchange Commission became alarmed at the size of the unrealized gains building up in the portfolio and demanded he set aside a provision to cover the tax impact if he is forced to liquidate the fund. While Mr. Levine says that won\u2019t happen, he has complied, and that has driven up the fund\u2019s expense ratio to what he says is artificially high. (Morningstar pegs it at 1.33%.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never distribute, so it\u2019s academic,\u201d Mr. Levine says. He adds that if a new president succeeds in lowering the corporate tax rate, it would benefit the fund\u2019s investors.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Abella is a more-active investor. He cut back on his fund\u2019s holdings in the energy sector and in pipelines, noting that \u201cgood performance is also about avoiding the losers, and you can never take a dividend for granted in any company.\u201d\n\nIn the past 12 months, Mr. Abella\u2019s fund has generated a return of 20.09%, mostly thanks to consumer staples with solid dividends. He\u2019s now taking a more-cautious view of this sector, whose yields have fallen.\n\nIndeed, yields have fallen across the board, Mr. Abella notes. Until recently, the fund was able to produce an average yield for its investors of north of 4%, in exchange for total fees of about 1.07%; today, that is closer to 3.8%. He is keeping his eyes open for when the Fed returns to raising rates, when he will look to scour the financial sector for opportunities.\n\nMs. McGee is a writer in New England.

Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News\n\nInvestors who aren\u2019t experienced in picking stocks might consider an actively managed fund that is able to spot financially solid companies, or if they prefer an index fund, an exchange-traded fund with a bias toward financially solid companies.\n\nVanguard Dividend Growth Fund (VDIGX), which invests in companies with ample cash and a strong record of lifting dividends, holds Morningstar Inc. \u2019s top rating of gold. Its major holdings include Microsoft Corp. , United Parcel Service Inc. and Costco Wholesale Corp.\n\nJensen Quality Growth Fund (JENSX) has Morningstar\u2019s silver rating and owns companies with a high return on equity and good growth prospects, such as PepsiCo Inc. and Becton, Dickinson & Co.\n\nFor an index-based approach, iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF (QUAL) tracks an index that comprises large-cap and midcap U.S. stocks with strong profitability, modest debt and steady earnings growth. Its holdings include PepsiCo and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nAdd some cash\u2026\n\nAthena client portfolios now have a median cash balance of slightly above 6%, up more than 50% from a recent low in late winter last year, says Dr. Cooper.\n\nBy owning some short-term municipal bonds, the firm aims to get a yield on that money of around 0.9% instead of the near-zero interest rates prevalent among money-market funds.\n\nBesides giving investors the opportunity to buy during market corrections, keeping cash on hand reduces the risk of having to sell stocks at depressed levels to meet spending needs, adds Mr. Zaccarelli of Cornerstone Financial. But he doesn\u2019t favor parking money in short-term bonds. Although those may only have modest risk, outright cash is the safest, he says.\n\nRISK: THE ECONOMY | Uh-oh. Another jobs report on Friday.

But with the election and other events adding to uncertainty, stocks may remain volatile. Investors could use such pullbacks as opportunities to bolster performance, he says.\n\nMike Mullaney, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co., Boston, suggests \u201cnibbling\u201d at stocks when the S&P 500 index stands below 2050. But he cautions that the U.S. economy and market wouldn\u2019t be immune if the U.K. and eurozone were to fall into recession.\n\nTwo very low-cost ways to get broad market exposure are Schwab U.S. Broad Market (SCHB), with an expense ratio of just 0.03% of assets a year, and Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI), which charges 0.05% in expenses. Each tracks several thousand U.S. stocks.\n\nLook for pockets of growth\n\nBecause broad market gains could be harder to come by, take a more targeted approach, says Atul Lele, chief investment officer of Bahamas-based Deltec International Group. One sector he likes is housing, which he says will be largely insulated from global events while benefiting from rising incomes, demographic trends and moderate mortgage rates. He suggests owning SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB), which owns shares of builders as well as makers of building products, home furnishings and appliances.\n\nCornerstone\u2019s Mr. Zaccarelli adds that health-care stocks typically fare well in the later stages of an expansion. He suggests skirting pharmaceutical and biotechnology issues, which have lagged behind the rest of the sector. Instead, own medical-services stocks, which have been gaining but have further appreciation potential, he says.\n\nTwo ETFs that give investors exposure to that sector are iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers (IHF), which owns shares in UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Express Scripts Holding Co. , and SPDR S&P Health Care Services (XHS), which owns similar companies but weights component stocks more equally.\n\nNarrow ETFs can complement a position in a broad index such as the S&P 500 or Russell 1000, but investors should keep in mind that narrower plays pose greater risk, says Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual-fund research at S&P Global. Moreover, he notes, broader stock indexes such as the S&P or Russell 1000 often include the same stocks as such narrow ETFs.\n\nFind value abroad\n\nMany European stocks have lagged behind the upward moves by their U.S. counterparts and represent good value, says Neuberger Berman\u2019s Mr. Knutzen. They stand to benefit as European corporate profitability gradually recovers amid massive stimulus by the European Central Bank and possibly also fiscal stimulus by European nations, Mr. Knutzen says.\n\nBut investors need to be cautious because of heightened geopolitical risk, he adds. He suggests doing any buying through \u201cdollar-cost averaging\u201d\u2014adding modestly at intervals over a period of months.\n\nA geographically broader fund is Thornburg International Growth (TIGAX), which holds about half of its portfolio in European companies of various market-cap sizes. Manager Tim Cunningham says that the fund is unusual in its tilt toward growth and that peers more typically have a value focus.\n\nMr. Pollock is a writer in Ridgewood, N.J.

So we introduce Ask Encore as a regular feature in the Wealth Management and the Investing in Funds & ETFs reports. Written by Glenn Ruffenach, a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal, and co-author of \u201cThe Wall Street Journal Complete Retirement Guidebook,\u201d the column will examine financial issues for those thinking about, planning and living their retirement. We welcome your questions and comments at reports@wsj.com.\n\nI will be 66 in April, and my wife will be turning 65 in July. Given the new Social Security rules, what would be the most effective strategy to optimize our benefits? My wife devoted herself to a career as a full-time mother, which unfortunately means that, in the eyes of the Social Security Administration, she doesn\u2019t qualify for retirement benefits.\n\nGiven your ages, you can still take advantage of a claiming strategy that has largely been curtailed. But you would need to act quickly. First, some background.\n\nThe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, enacted in November, puts an end, in most instances, to two Social Security filing strategies: \u201cfile and suspend\u201d and a \u201crestricted application\u201d for spousal benefits. (You can find a summary of the changes at MarketWatch.com. Search for: \u201cnew Social Security rules change claiming strategies.\u201d)\n\nIn the months since, we have heard from numerous readers who have asked, in effect, the same question: What do I do now?\n\nBroadly speaking, there are still steps that would-be beneficiaries can take to \u201coptimize,\u201d or maximize, their benefits in retirement. (Example: Each year you delay collecting Social Security between ages 62 and 70, your payout increases about 7%.) The best way to do the math is to take advantage of the growing number of tools and online advisory services that help identify an individual\u2019s (or couple\u2019s) optimal claiming strategy.\n\nAt this point, most services have updated their computer coding to account for the new rules. Among them: SSAnalyze!; and MaximizeMySocialSecurity.com, SocialSecurityChoices.com and SocialSecuritySolutions.com. The latter three all charge a fee.\n\nAs for this specific question, the Budget Act has several grandfather clauses, one of which allows a person who has reached full retirement age to file and suspend\u2014as long as the request to do so is received before April 30.\n\nIf you turn 66 before that date, you could file and suspend, which would allow your wife to begin collecting a spousal benefit. (If you plan to do this, I would book an appointment immediately with your local Social Security office, or apply online. You can do so four months before turning 66.) Meanwhile, your benefit, when you eventually claim it, will have grown in size, thanks to \u201cdelayed retirement credits.\u201d\n\nBut again\u2014and without knowing the specifics of your financial situation\u2014I would urge you to run the numbers through an advisory service. Social Security remains far too complicated to try this on your own.\n\nMy husband and I have two daughters in college. How can we help them begin to build a good credit score?\n\nStart by sitting your daughters down and explaining the possible consequences of having a bad credit score, says Beverly Harzog, a consumer-credit expert and author of \u201cConfessions of a Credit Junkie.\u201d As your children enter the workforce and start their own households, their bills\u2014for an auto loan, a mortgage, health and life insurance\u2014will likely be higher if they fail to build a strong credit history.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, arrange for your daughters to be an \u201cauthorized user\u201d on your credit-card account\u2014and set up alerts (say, for a purchase exceeding $50) to monitor their spending. (Avoid co-signing for a credit card in a student\u2019s own name. You will be legally responsible for making payments if your child comes up short.)\n\nDouble check that your credit-card issuer does report authorized-user information to credit bureaus, Ms. Harzog notes. Many issuers do\u2014but not all.\n\nAt some point, look for a second form of credit: say, a gas or department-store credit card, or installment debt, such as a personal or auto loan. For students living off campus, monthly rent and utilities payments won\u2019t do much to help credit scores. But missing such payments (including cellphone bills!) could end up being reported to credit bureaus.\n\nWhich leads, of course, to the single-most important (credit) lesson you can share with your daughters: Pay all your bills on time\u2014every time.\n\nIf that message sticks, says Ms. Harzog, \u201cyou really empower your kids.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier column and question about Social Security, you mentioned a \u201crestricted application.\u201d My wife and I are both 63 years old. She is planning to retire at 66, her full retirement age, and I plan to continue to work for an indeterminate amount of time, possibly until I turn 70. Is a restricted application still available in our situation?\n\nYes, you can still take advantage of this strategy\u2014but only because you have already passed your 62nd birthday.\n\nUnder the changes in Social Security claiming strategies, workers who reached age 62 before the end of 2015 are still able to file a restricted application when they reach full retirement age. This means a person could file for just a spousal benefit, instead of his or her own benefit.\n\nLet\u2019s say your wife claims a benefit of $2,000 a month at her full retirement age. When you reach your full retirement age, you could claim a spousal benefit of $1,000 (half of your wife\u2019s benefit) and defer claiming your own benefit to, say, age 70.", "date": null, "title": "A Strategy to Maximize Social Security Benefits"}

I understand the need for erring on the side of caution, but that figure seems somewhat excessive. Can you recommend a good tool for estimating one\u2019s life expectancy?\n\nActually, that suggestion makes more sense than you might think. Between 1980 and 2010, the population age 90 and older nearly tripled, reaching 1.9 million people, according to the Census Bureau. Over the next four decades, the 90-plus demographic is expected to quadruple. (And just FYI: The U.S. had 53,364 centenarians in 2010.)\n\nThe point: Many people, when planning for retirement, tend to underestimate their life expectancy and, as a result, tend to overestimate how much they can spend after they leave the office.\n\nAsk a Question Have a question about planning for and living in retirement? Email askencore@wsj.com\n\nAll that said, there are several good tools that can help you judge how many more birthday parties to plan for. Two popular ones are livingto100.com and How Long Will I Live? (go to myabaris.com and click on Tools). Both incorporate variables like family history, personal health and socioeconomic status.\n\nAlso check out Blue Zones, a public-health organization, and its \u201cVitality Compass.\u201d (Go to bluezones.com and click on Tools.) This particular calculator\u2014in addition to estimating life expectancy\u2014can help forecast \u201chealthy-life expectancy,\u201d or the age a person will reach before being diagnosed with heart disease, diabetes or cancer. The site also offers tips for living longer.\n\nI am 74 years old and, each year, take my required minimum withdrawal from my 401(k) with Vanguard. My wife has a 403(b) plan with a different investment firm. She is 70 years old and needs to begin withdrawals this year. Her investment firm representative mentioned that since we file jointly on our tax return, my wife\u2019s required withdrawal could be made from my 401(k). Is that correct?\n\nYour wife needs a new investment rep.\n\nThere is no such thing as a \u201cjoint\u201d 401(k) or a \u201cjoint\u201d 403(b), says Ed Slott, a certified public accountant and individual-retirement-account specialist in Rockville Centre, N.Y. When the time comes, participants in retirement plans must make individual withdrawals from their individual accounts\u2014even if a wife and husband file jointly and the combined income goes on the same tax return. So, you must continue to withdraw your required minimum from your 401(k), and your wife must withdraw her required minimum from her 403(b).\n\nIndeed, if you follow the representative\u2019s advice, you could create a nasty tax problem for yourselves, Mr. Slott says. To start, you would withdraw more than the required minimum from the 401(k) and end up paying more in taxes. Meanwhile, there would be no withdrawal from the 403(b).\n\nFailing to take that required distribution would result in a 50% penalty on the shortfall. (If you are supposed to withdraw $10,000, the Internal Revenue Service will bill you $5,000.)\n\n\u201cInvestment advisers really need to know the tax rules,\u201d Mr. Slott says. \u201cThey are managing retirement accounts subject to these rules. That is the bigger story.\u201d\n\nI have about $1 million in various retirement accounts, mostly in stocks. I have a real-estate rental that is worth about $300,000 that is intended to generate income in retirement. In light of all I read about the asset-allocation classes of stock, bonds and cash, where would I count the real estate in these models?\n\nThink of that property as stock.\n\nTo start, the income isn\u2019t guaranteed, as it would be with, say, a certificate of deposit, says Mark Maisonneuve, a portfolio manager in Farmington Hills, Mich. Yes, you might have a lease and a tenant who makes regular (even increasing) payments. But unexpected expenses to maintain (or in the case of bad tenants, rehabilitate) the property could turn the asset\u2019s return from gain to loss.\n\nLooking ahead, the sale price of the property\u2014if you or your heirs decide to sell\u2014is completely unknown; there is no creditor pledging to make good on the return of principal on a set date as with a bond.\n\nIn fact, rental property would go into the more speculative part of one\u2019s stock allocation, and requires close attention, Mr. Maisonneuve adds.\n\n\u201cLandlords consider rentals as safer because they see all the inner workings,\u201d he says. \u201cBut property is never as liquid as many stocks, nor do stocks wake us up in the middle of the night to deal with a crumbling foundation or collapsed sewer drain.\u201d\n\nI have two questions. If my wife (born in 1954) takes Social Security before she reaches her full retirement age and continues to work, I understand that her benefits could be reduced temporarily if her salary exceeds certain levels. How does a younger spouse\u2019s full-time earnings affect these thresholds? And if I decide to delay claiming Social Security benefits, how much time needs to pass before I see an increase in my payout? In other words, do benefits increase each month that I wait, or each year that I wait?\n\nYour first question refers to Social Security\u2019s \u201cearnings test.\u201d And you\u2019re correct: People who collect both benefits and a salary before reaching full retirement age could see their benefits reduced if their income exceeds certain levels.\n\nThe earnings of a spouse aren\u2019t part of this calculation. So if your wife is collecting benefits and earning a paycheck, her salary\u2014and her salary alone\u2014will determine if there is a reduction in her benefits.\n\nTo answer your second question: A person\u2019s Social Security payout will increase each month that he or she waits to claim benefits. (Put another way: You don\u2019t have to wait 12 months for a larger check.)\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re eligible for a benefit of $1,000 at a full retirement age of 66. If you claim benefits at age 63 and four months, your monthly benefit would total $822; if you wait an additional month, the payout would be $828.

Yes, nice weather and a low cost of living are important factors in choosing a retirement destination. But equally important is a community\u2019s commitment (if any) to older adults and their evolving needs.\n\nHow to Invest in Real Estate There are a lot of ways to go about real-estate investment. But typically some combination of four options is considered: VIEW Interactive\n\nThe most recent report, published in November 2014, ranked 352 metropolitan areas, with one ranking for the 100 largest metro areas and a second ranking for the next 252 medium and smaller cities.\n\nIn the former category, Madison, Wis. (a \u201chub of innovation and intellectual stimulation\u201d) took top honors; in the latter grouping, Iowa City, Iowa (a \u201ctop-notch health-care system, a strong economy and low unemployment\u201d) came out No. 1.\n\n\u201cBest Cities\u201d is published biennially. A new version will be available in the fall, says Jeff Monford, a spokesman for the institute.\n\nI have long assumed that my retirement plan, a 403(b), is protected from creditors. But a friend tells me that isn\u2019t necessarily true. If I am sued, is my retirement account safe? And what about my IRA?\n\nFirst, it\u2019s important to distinguish between Erisa-qualified retirement plans and non-Erisa plans, says Ed Slott, a certified public accountant and individual-retirement-account specialist in Rockville Centre, N.Y.\n\nA retirement plan set up under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or Erisa, is protected from most creditors in most circumstances: bankruptcy proceedings, civil lawsuits, etc. (Among the few exceptions: a divorce proceeding, in which an ex-spouse can lay claim to retirement assets.) \u201cErisa qualified\u201d means an employer-sponsored retirement plan complies with federal rules involving, among other things, reports to participants, funding and vesting.\n\nThe problem: Not all company retirement plans\u2014and especially not all 403(b)s\u2014are Erisa plans, and those that aren\u2019t don\u2019t have federal protection from creditors, Mr. Slott notes. As such, you should look closely at how your particular plan is set up.\n\nAs for your IRA, a separate law, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, protects your account in the event that you file for bankruptcy\u2014but only bankruptcy. Whether your IRA is protected from creditors in other proceedings depends on state law. (Creditor protection for non-Erisa company plans is also determined under state law.) Some states shield IRAs in virtually all instances; other states offer little protection. So\u2026check the rules where you live.\n\nWhat document can you show the Social Security Administration to prove that you are married other than a marriage license? My sister wants to collect on her late husband\u2019s benefits, but she can\u2019t locate the license\u2014nor can the city hall where she was married.\n\nYou have several options, according to Dorothy Clark, a senior public-affairs specialist with the Social Security Administration.\n\nA signed statement from the member of the clergy or official who performed the marriage ceremony could be used as proof. So could statements of witnesses to the marriage ceremony, a newspaper account of the wedding or statements from at least two individuals who knew the ceremony took place. (The statements must include the relationship of the person to the spouses, as well as details explaining how the person knew of the ceremony.)\n\n\u201cUsually, one piece of secondary proof is sufficient, combined with as much information as possible concerning the events surrounding the marriage ceremony,\u201d Ms. Clark says. \u201cHowever, if the evidence submitted is suspect or unconvincing, Social Security may request another piece of evidence.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m beyond full retirement age and still working, as well as collecting Social Security. My employer is withholding Social Security and Medicare taxes from my paycheck. Are these excessive and refundable?\n\nSuch deductions might appear to be \u201cexcessive\u201d\u2014but that\u2019s how the rules work.\n\nThis questions pops up frequently at tax time. Regardless of your age, employers are required to deduct these taxes from your pay as long as you continue to work. And the fact that you\u2019re collecting Social Security or receiving Medicare benefits makes no difference.\n\nOne piece of good news: Social Security checks annually to see whether your additional earnings will increase your monthly benefit. If there is an increase, the agency will send you a letter about your new benefit amount\n\nPlanning for retirement can be a daunting process that raises a host of questions.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nFor many people, there is no legal document that is more crucial than a power of attorney.\n\nOr one so full of potential pitfalls.\n\nA power of attorney is an inexpensive legal document that gives a designated individual the right to act on another\u2019s behalf when making financial decisions. It\u2019s typically used by adult children whose aging parents are no longer capable of acting on their own. The problem is that financial institutions don\u2019t always make it easy to exercise that power, so families need to take steps to avoid potential problems.\n\nPowers of attorney come in several forms. The most basic cover specific situations\u2014for example, a father may give his daughter authority to act for him when selling the family home. Most adult children seek a far broader document\u2014a so-called durable power of attorney that allows them to take over a parent\u2019s finances at any point, which gives them the ability to help in the event the parent is no longer able to manage. (Separate health-care powers of attorney cover medical decisions.)\n\nUnfortunately, experts say, the power of attorney is often abused\u2014either by adult children seeking to enrich themselves or by criminals who forge them to steal from elders.\n\nAs a result, banks worried about being held liable for customers\u2019 losses have grown wary of accepting powers of attorney, prompting a growing number of states to adopt laws requiring them to do so under certain circumstances. Hope Heyman, 63, of Greenburgh, N.Y., says all but one of the eight financial institutions where her recently deceased father, Paul Heyman, held assets balked at recognizing her power of attorney after he suffered a stroke in July 2014.\n\n\u201cIt was the most frustrating three months I have ever spent,\u201d she says of the time it took her to gain control of her parents\u2019 assets to pay their bills. \u201cMy father was very ill and my mother was not functioning well and my sister and I were both helping out from afar,\u201d says Ms. Heyman. When she finally found an institution that accepted the family\u2019s document, that paved the way for her to transfer her parents\u2019 assets there.\n\nAvoiding court\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, adult children may have little recourse but to take legal action against a financial institution or file with a court to become a parent\u2019s legal guardian\u2014an expensive and time-consuming process that\u2019s usually open to the public. But there are steps children can take to keep matters from getting to that point.\n\nIf a parent has set up the power of attorney, the child\u2019s first step is to find out what kind of power it is. While a standard durable power of attorney gives the child the authority to act on the parent\u2019s behalf immediately after the document is signed, a so-called springing power of attorney doesn\u2019t generally give the child that authority until the parent becomes incapacitated.\n\nWhile many parents prefer the springing variety, attorneys say it can create extra complications for adult children\u2014and generally should be replaced by a durable power of attorney without the springing provision.\n\nFor example, to use a springing power of attorney, many forms require an adult child to obtain a statement from at least one designated person\u2014often a physician\u2014certifying that the parent is incapacitated. But medical-privacy laws can make it difficult to communicate with someone else\u2019s physician.\n\nMoreover, a doctor may be unwilling to sign such a statement, says Jim Oliver, a financial adviser in San Antonio. After Mr. Oliver\u2019s mother-in-law suffered several ministrokes in 2008, he says, her doctor agreed that she was incapacitated but wouldn\u2019t sign a letter to that effect on the grounds that she might recover.\n\nThink ahead\n\nFamilies can frequently prevent problems if parents introduce an adult child with a power of attorney to their financial adviser before a time of crisis and find out more about the procedures their banks and brokerage firms require or request. For instance, many financial institutions ask account owners to sign separate powers of attorney drafted by the firm\u2019s own lawyers, if only because it\u2019s easier for them to administer a standardized form, says Michael Delgass, chief executive of Sontag Advisory LLC in New York.\n\nBecause some of these forms require a person to waive his or her right to sue the firm, people should be sure to read the fine print, says Mr. Delgass, who recommends asking financial institutions to also put the child\u2019s own power of attorney on file. At Wells Fargo Advisors LLC, it typically takes three to five days to process a power of attorney, says Ronald Long, the firm\u2019s director of regulatory affairs and elder-client initiatives. Staff must ensure the document conforms to state law, he says.\n\nIf a bank or brokerage firm rejects a power of attorney, the person should ask why and consider making modifications. Charles Schwab Corp. , for example, says it examines durable powers of attorney for language allowing the person being given the power of attorney to engage in specific actions, such as trading options, designating beneficiaries and using a margin account.\n\nKnow the law\n\nWhat should people do if they are rebuffed by a financial institution when trying to use a power of attorney on behalf of a parent who is unable to get involved? First, they should take a shot at an easy solution\u2014ask to speak to a supervisor, or try another branch, says Brad Frigon, an elder-law attorney in Englewood, Colo.\n\nSome financial institutions may ask you to take steps designed to reassure them that your power of attorney is legitimate. Ms. Heyman, for example, was asked to verify her identity by securing a so-called medallion signature guarantee from a bank with her signature on file. If an adult child tries to use a power of attorney without a parent being present, Wells Fargo Advisors asks for a notarized affidavit stating that the document is valid, says Mr. Long.\n\nIt also pays to know state law.

In either case, we\u2019re trying to figure out what features, at a minimum, we should look for in a new house\u2014or add to our current house\u2014so that we can stay in our home as we get older. Does the housing industry have any guidelines or requirements for retirees?\n\n\u201cAging in place\u201d is a hot topic. Three resources can help a great deal.\n\nStart with a report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University: \u201cHousing America\u2019s Older Adults: Meeting the Needs of an Aging Population.\u201d The study identifies five features, in particular, that make for safe and accessible homes: no-step entries; single-floor living; switches and outlets reachable at any height; extra-wide hallways and doors; and lever-style door and faucet handles.\n\nAsk a Question Have a question about planning for and living in retirement? Email askencore@wsj.com\n\n(The good news: Almost 90% of existing homes have at least one of these features, the study notes. The bad news: Only 57% have more than one.)\n\nNext, check out the National Association of Home Builders and its \u201cAging-in-Place Remodeling Checklist.\u201d Here, you\u2019ll find more than 100 suggestions (including eight for entryways alone) that can help homeowners age 50-plus live \u201csafely, independently and comfortably.\u201d\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the \u201cHomeFit Guide\u201d from AARP, the Washington-based advocacy group. This 26-page report, filled with diagrams, explains how to create a \u201clifelong home,\u201d one that\u2019s \u201csuitable for anyone, regardless of\u2026age or physical ability.\u201d Well worth your time.\n\nFor almost two decades I\u2019ve had my investments of over seven figures handled by the same adviser. I\u2019m not too happy with the total results or the fees. What is your opinion of splitting my holdings\u2014say, 50/50 or one-third/two-thirds\u2014with another adviser?\n\nIt\u2019s wise, at the least, to consider a change. (Many people, even in the face of excessive fees or poor results, are reluctant to fire an adviser, typically because they have formed a personal connection.) But this particular solution\u2014dividing your assets\u2014isn\u2019t the best of ideas.\n\nTo start, you could end up paying more in fees than you are now, says Michael Kitces, director of wealth management at Pinnacle Advisory Group Inc. in Columbia, Md. Breaking your large nest egg into two (relatively) small nest eggs means you might not benefit from the discounted fees that some advisers offer to clients with sizable holdings.\n\nPerhaps more important: How much time do you plan to give the new adviser? Six months? A year? More? If you split your holdings just as markets are jumping higher (or tanking), your new adviser\u2019s performance, especially in the short term, might simply be a matter of good (or bad) timing, rather than a reflection of his or her actual abilities.\n\nAnd\u2026do you plan to tell the new adviser about all your assets? Investors who split their holdings often are hesitant to give a new adviser a full picture of their portfolio (wanting, first, to see how well the new adviser performs with a piece of that portfolio). Such an omission is asking for trouble, says Mike Piper, a certified public accountant in Manitou Springs, Colo., and author of the Oblivious Investor blog.\n\nTake taxes. If the new adviser knows about some, but not all, of the investor\u2019s accounts and holdings, recommendations about which type of account (Roth, tax-deferred, or taxable) to spend from (or contribute to) will be \u201cpoorly reasoned,\u201d Mr. Piper says.\n\nIn short, splitting your holdings tends to be problematic. \u201cKeeping half your portfolio with an adviser who is charging too much and not delivering value is still half too much,\u201d Mr. Kitces says. One alternative: meeting with a financial planner who charges by the hour. Such a meeting would allow you to get a fully informed second opinion without having to move any portion of your portfolio, Mr. Piper says.\n\nIt also would help minimize fees: Pay the adviser as needed for guidance, then hire a low-cost portfolio management firm to implement the recommendations.\n\nI understand that I can get Social Security\u2014but can change my mind in the first year and return the money. Is that rule still valid? If so, and if I decide to do that, what would my monthly benefit be? Would it be the benefit I received when I first applied for Social Security, or would the benefit be based on my new application date?\n\nYes. Still valid. But, as always, there are wrinkles.\n\nIf you begin collecting Social Security retirement benefits, and then have second thoughts about your decision, you can withdraw your Social Security claim and reapply at a future date, says William Jarrett, a public-affairs specialist with the Social Security Administration. The catch: This option is available only for the first 12 months after you become entitled to benefits. After that, it\u2019s off the table. (And you can do this only once in your lifetime.)\n\nIf you decide to withdraw your application, you must repay all the benefits you and your family received based on your retirement application, Mr. Jarrett notes. That includes any benefits your spouse or children received, as well as money withheld from your checks, including Medicare premiums. What\u2019s more, anyone who received benefits based on your application must consent in writing to the withdrawal.\n\nAfter the withdrawal has been approved, you must file a new application to receive retirement benefits\u2014and that payment amount will be based on the new application date.\n\nMr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal, and co-author of \u201cThe Wall Street Journal Complete Retirement Guidebook.\u201d His column examines financial issues for those thinking about, planning and living their retirement.

Can you recommend resources or tools that can help with planning for the future?\n\nThis question is more important than most people approaching retirement realize. Most of us, if asked, will say we want a mix of travel, play and meaningful work in later life. Specifics, though, tend to be few and far between. The point: Planning how to fill your days in retirement is just as essential as financial planning.\n\nSome good places to start: Life Reimagined, an AARP website, offers free online tutorials on topics including setting goals and career planning.

(Check out, too, the \u201cEncore Career Handbook,\u201d by Marci Alboher, an Encore.org executive. Invaluable.)

Email askencore@wsj.com\n\nAlso see: Life Planning Network is a group of professionals and organizations that help people \u201cnavigate the second half of life.\u201d Coming of Age has a good ebook (\u201cThe Age for Change\u201d) that can help answer the question: \u201cWhat now?\u201d And Project Renewment and the Transition Network are designed to help women, in particular, shape their futures.\n\nNote: Don\u2019t be put off if some of these resources appear to be overly\u2026cheery. Or repetitive. (Phrases like \u201cfind your passion!\u201d and \u201cfollow your dreams!\u201d crop up regularly.) Creating a life after the office involves time and effort, and a little cheerleading along the way doesn\u2019t hurt.\n\nI just received my annual statement from my 401(k) administrator and noticed an entry under \u201cBalances\u201d that reads: \u201cPost 86\u2014$28,200.\u201d What is \u201cPost 86\u201d? And what is that figure?\n\nThat\u2019s an entry that\u2019s easy to overlook\u2014and one that can make for a pleasant surprise, if and when you roll over your 401(k) into an individual retirement account.\n\nNormally, contributions to 401(k)s are made with pretax dollars. But \u201cPost 86\u201d means you have after-tax contributions in your retirement account. More to the point, these contributions were made \u201cpost,\u201d or after, 1986. That year is important in tax circles. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 overhauled the tax treatment of retirement plans and drew a distinction between after-tax contributions made before 1987 and after 1986. Accordingly, 401(k) custodians keep track of such contributions, if any, in participants\u2019 accounts.\n\nSo\u2026your annual statement is showing that you have $28,200 in after-tax contributions, all made in 1987 or later. How did that money get there? Some retirement plans allow participants to make after-tax contributions. A more likely scenario is that your 401(k) accepted a rollover of after-tax funds that you had in an earlier, different retirement plan.\n\nAll of this becomes interesting when you retire. If you decide to roll over your 401(k) into an IRA, you can roll $28,200 of the amount directly into a Roth IRA with no tax liability. (The IRS in 2014 simplified the process.) The trick is recognizing you have \u201cPost 86\u201d funds and knowing how to handle them.\n\n\u201cI suspect that most people don\u2019t even notice it,\u201d says Barry Kaplan, chief investment officer at Cambridge Wealth Counsel in Atlanta. \u201cAnd if they do, [they] don\u2019t know what it is, nor do they point it out to their accountant, who may not be aware until after a rollover is already completed.\u201d\n\nI turn 63 soon, and my wife is 60. Can I file and suspend now, since I\u2019m eligible for Social Security, and thereby allow my wife to collect spousal benefits? Or must I wait until I\u2019m 66 to be able to file and then suspend?\n\nUnfortunately, you\u2019re out of luck\u2014on two counts.\n\nIn years past, a worker at full retirement age could file for a benefit and then suspend it, enabling his or her spouse to begin collecting a spousal benefit. But the key words in that sentence are \u201cfull retirement age.\u201d At age 63, you wouldn\u2019t qualify.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, new federal rules are eliminating the file-and-suspend strategy. Only those individuals who reach full retirement age, which is currently 66, before April 30 can still take advantage of this provision.\n\nI am age 71 and still working. And I am still contributing to a 401(k). Do I have to take required withdrawals?\n\nMost people, after reaching age 70\u00bd, are required to begin withdrawing funds from their retirement accounts. One exception: people who are still working. So, broadly speaking, you don\u2019t have to worry, at the moment, about pulling money from your plan.\n\nBut\u2026the \u201cstill-working\u201d exception does not apply if you own more than 5% of the company. What\u2019s more, the still-working exception applies only to the company where you\u2019re currently employed, says Ed Slott, a a certified public accountant and IRA specialist in Rockville Centre, N.Y.\n\nIf you have a 401(k), for instance, with a former employer\u2014and/or if you have an IRA\u2014you would be required to withdraw funds from those accounts.\n\nPlanning for retirement can be a daunting process that raises a host of questions.

Browning joins MoneyBeat to explain that while markets have been pushing into record territory, investors should always be ready for a downturn, and a potential bear market. Photo: Getty\n\nWith the six-year bull market in stocks getting old, people are starting to wonder how they should prepare for a possible bear market.\n\nThe answer: Not the way you think.\n\nThe biggest mistake ordinary investors make, aside from not saving enough, is trying to predict the market.\n\nIllustration: Robert Neubecker\n\nInstead of tinkering with their holdings, financial planners and academics say, people should build all-weather portfolios of stocks, bonds, cash and other items that can rise in good markets and limit declines in bad ones. Then they might find themselves actually embracing bear markets as opportunities to buy stocks at discounts.\n\n\u201cThe less you tinker with the details, the less you have the opportunity to screw them up,\u201d says Terrance Odean, chairman of the finance group at Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, who studies investor behavior.\n\nPeople who change their holdings because they see a bear market coming almost always lose out.\n\nThe average investor in stock mutual funds made 3.8% a year over the past 30 years, according to Boston research firm Dalbar Inc. That is one-third of the S&P 500\u2019s average 11.1% gain in that period. Dalbar\u2019s explanation for this sad performance: People buy and sell funds at all the wrong times.\n\nNo time to \u2018time\u2019\n\nProf. Odean\u2019s studies have shown that people buy and sell stocks at the wrong times. They sell stocks that are poised to rise and buy stocks that do worse than those they sold. \u201cThey did worse than if they had been throwing darts,\u201d Prof. Odean said after completing one study.\n\nThis is the problem people have preparing for a bear market. They aren\u2019t good at picking the top, and they panic and sell once stocks have fallen heavily, when they should be buying.\n\nEven people who get out before a bear market often shoot themselves in the foot: They are too frightened to get back in and miss the rebound.\n\n\u201cThe overriding emotions in an investor are greed in a bull market and fear and shame in a down market,\u201d says John Schott, a Harvard-educated psychiatrist who works today as a money manager at Steinberg Global Asset Management in Florida. People generally overestimate their ability to tolerate a market decline by a factor of two, he says.\n\n\u201cPanic is overwhelming to the part of the cortex used in rational decisions and planning,\u201d he says.\n\nThe problem is especially bad now, Dr. Schott says, because people who were burned in the collapses of 2000 and 2008 \u201chave a fear in their own minds that they will be hurt again.\u201d That has kept many people out of stocks even as the S&P 500 has tripled since 2009. Anxiety also makes people trade too much, incurring losses, fees and tax liabilities, he says.\n\nWhat to do now\n\nIf this is true, how can people be prepared for a bear market?\n\nMoney managers offer one solution: Give them the money, pay a yearly fee and let them worry.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t like that solution, there is an alternative: Weatherproof your portfolio. By diversifying broadly, with enough stocks to ensure gains in good years and enough bonds to limit losses in bad ones, investors can create a portfolio that can withstand bull and bear markets alike. Then they should stop trading.\n\nProf. Terrance Odean says investors shouldn\u2019t tinker too much. Photo: Jim Block\n\n\u201cBuy an all-market U.S.-stock index fund and a really broad-based international fund and a broad-based bond fund, to keep fees really low,\u201d Prof. Odean recommends. High front-end charges and annual fees charged by some funds and money managers can hinder annual gains, he notes.\n\nPeople need to try to figure out their real risk tolerances, he says, and mix their stocks, bonds and cash to match those. Then rebalance the mix annually, so it stays steady. Some people do that by changing new purchases or rebalancing nontaxable retirement accounts, to avoid capital gains in taxable accounts.\n\nFoster Group Inc., a financial advisory firm in West Des Moines, Iowa, is a microcosm of this philosophy. Founded in 1989, it started as a classic picker of stocks and sectors, trying to boost client performance.\n\nMark Stadtlander, now chief executive, found himself waking up with sore teeth in 1994. \u201cI was literally grinding my teeth because I was anxious about the service we were providing our clients,\u201d he says.\n\nThe firm\u2019s disappointing performance that year, a difficult one for stocks, drove home that trying to predict the market was the wrong goal. So Foster changed its approach. Today, it recommends broad mixes of stocks, real estate and bonds in the U.S. and abroad, rebalanced regularly. Its base suggestion is 60% stocks and 40% bonds. It adjusts that for the client\u2019s age, risk tolerance and other assets.\n\nIn 1997, Foster managed $100 million. Today, it oversees $1.6 billion.\n\nKeeping out of trouble\n\nHow can people stifle the impulse to trade and predict? \u201cBy not following the market,\u201d Prof. Odean says.\n\nThe most common thing investors wonder is: Where is the market headed?\n\nIllustration: Robert Neubecker\n\nWhat they should ask is: When? When do I need the money? Money to be spent in the next few years must be protected from decline, in short-term bonds or cash. Money needed later has time to recover from a decline, so more can be in faster-growing assets like stocks.\n\nAn old rule of thumb is that your bond percentage should equal your age, although many financial planners say that, with people living longer, stock holdings should be higher than this benchmark suggests.\n\nA common misconception is that bond funds are the same as bonds. In the long term, bond funds act like bonds, but in the short run, they might not. Bond funds\u2019 value can decline if interest rates rise, because the value of existing bonds held by the funds, with their lower rates, declines. With an actual bond, you don\u2019t lose money unless you sell it. You get the interest you expected, just less than newer bonds may offer.\n\nFor people who can\u2019t stop trading, Prof. Odean has a suggestion: Take 90% of your money and put it in index funds. Take 10% and play with it, as long as you can afford to lose it.\n\nInvestors who overreact to the bear\u2019s reappearance nearly always lose out. Photo: Getty Images\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to remember something people have trouble accepting: Bear markets actually are great for long-term investors.\n\nPeople who contribute regularly to funds and don\u2019t need the money soon should celebrate when stocks fall 30% or 40%. Their regular purchases now buy stocks at a discount, and history shows that broad markets always rebound. Over time, they are ahead.\n\nInstead of selling, people should redouble their buying after a big drop. Easy to say. Hard to do.\n\nMr. Browning is a Wall Street Journal staff reporter.

So we have introduced Ask Encore as a regular feature in the Investing in Funds & ETFs and Wealth Management reports. Written by Glenn Ruffenach, a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal, and co-author of \u201cThe Wall Street Journal Complete Retirement Guidebook,\u201d the column examines financial issues for those thinking about, planning and living their retirement. We welcome your questions and comments at askencore@wsj.com.\n\nI\u2019m in my 50s and want to be sure my savings for retirement are protected up until retirement. People keep saying, \u201cGet disability insurance.\u201d But I can\u2019t find any good, specific advice about the relative merits of different insurers\u2019 plans. Do you know where I can find this data?\n\nThere is no single ranking of the \u201cbest\u201d disability policies or insurance carriers. One reason: Different insurers tend to be a better fit for different occupations, says Mark Desiderio, a disability and life-insurance specialist with Ryan Insurance Strategy Consultants in Greenwood Village, Colo. One carrier, for instance, might have a history of working with dentists (who, as a group, tend to be big purchasers of disability policies), while a second carrier might focus on lawyers or small-business owners.\n\n8 Questions to Answer About Investing for Retirement Everyone hopes to enter retirement with enough money to pay the bills. The key is understanding how to save and invest long before you retire. VIEW Interactive\n\nAlso, the large number of options available with individual policies (when benefits kick in, how long they last, how terms like \u201csickness\u201d and \u201cdisability\u201d are defined, etc.) makes it difficult to compare coverage\u2014and makes disability insurance an exceedingly complicated purchase.\n\nSo\u2026start with some homework. Three online insurance brokers\u2014PolicyGenius (policygenius.com), Disability Insurance Resource Center (di-resource-center.com) and Disability Insurance Quotes (disabilityquotes.com)\u2014offer good information and articles about the basics: how coverage works, how much you might need, and what to look for in a policy. (Of course, each of the three is also more than happy to sell you a policy, if you wish to go the online route. But again, use these sites, first, as a guide.)\n\nSecond, find an insurance agent who specializes in disability insurance, one who will provide several quotes from different carriers. Ideally, your financial adviser should be able to point you to such individuals in your area. Or call an insurer directly and ask for a local broker. Or, in addition to the firms and services named above, try Disability Insurance Services (diservices.com) in San Diego, which can help steer you to a specialist.\n\nFinally\u2014and if you want to cover all the bases\u2014take your policy of choice (before you sign on the dotted line) to a \u201cdisability claims consultant.\u201d These individuals, as the title suggests, work with existing policyholders whose claims for benefits have been questioned or rejected by insurers. As such, they are intimately familiar with the fine print (read: traps) in coverage that might trip you up in the future. \u201cDisability insurance is written in code,\u201d says Vivian Gallo, founder and president of Health Resources Consultants Inc. in White Plains, N.Y. \u201cIt sounds like English, but you need to know: What does the language really mean?\u201d\n\nIn a response to a question about Social Security, you pointed out that \u201cdelayed retirement credits\u201d aren\u2019t used when calculating a spousal benefit. But when a spouse dies while receiving delayed retirement credits, does the surviving spouse, when switching to the deceased\u2019s benefits, receive the full amount, including the delayed retirement credits?\n\nYes, a widow or widower, in contrast to a spouse, is eligible to collect delayed credits. (A person earns such credits by waiting to file for Social Security beyond his or her \u201cfull retirement age.\u201d That figure is climbing gradually to 67.) The size of the payout can vary, depending on when a person claims a survivor benefit.\n\nLet\u2019s say a husband, at full retirement age of 66, is eligible for a monthly benefit of $2,000. But he decides to delay claiming Social Security until 70, at which point his payout increases to $2,640, thanks to delayed retirement credits. If he dies first, his widow would be eligible to collect $2,640 a month, but only if she waits until her full retirement age to file for a survivor benefit. If she files early\u2014between 60 and full retirement age\u2014she would get 71.5% to 99% of her husband\u2019s benefit.\n\nThere is one additional wrinkle, and it is helpful: A surviving spouse has the ability to switch benefits. A widow could begin collecting a reduced benefit based on her earnings record at 62 and switch to a full survivor\u2019s benefit at full retirement age. (Or vice versa.) And those moves aren\u2019t affected by new federal rules that are largely curtailing such claiming strategies.\n\nI inherited a 401(k) from my father in 2014. Per the sponsor\u2019s rules, I have five years from the year of death to completely withdraw the money. My father was over 70\u00bd when he died so he had been taking annual required distributions. Here\u2019s my situation: The balance remaining is all after-tax dollars. When I was executing his estate I was surprised to discover this. Unfortunately he hadn\u2019t kept me informed about his investment details. If it was an inherited IRA, I believe I could convert it to a Roth IRA, but inherited 401(k)s have different tax rules. Do I have any distribution options that will minimize income-tax implications?\n\nYou will have to stick with the plan\u2019s five year-rule. But the good news is that the tax bite should be minimal.\n\nFirst, we assume you were named as the beneficiary on the 401(k) beneficiary form. If so, you could have rolled over the funds directly to an inherited IRA or even converted the 401(k) balance to an inherited Roth IRA, says Ed Slott, a certified public accountant and IRA specialist in Rockville Centre, N.Y. But\u2026those steps had to be taken by the end of 2015\u2014the year after death\u2014and that date has passed. So, at this point, the entire inherited plan balance must be withdrawn by the end of 2019.\n\n(If you weren\u2019t the beneficiary, and if the 401(k) went to your father\u2019s estate, the five-year rule would have kicked in automatically.)\n\nThe good news: Given that all the 401(k) funds are after-tax dollars, withdrawals\u2014even under the five-year rule\u2014will be tax-free, Mr. Slott notes. Of course, any earnings on those funds would be taxable. But from your description of the account, that seems unlikely.\n\nMr. Ruffenach is a retired Wall Street Journal reporter and editor living in Georgia.

But that doesn\u2019t work with fund companies, which are bound by rules on how they communicate with clients. They save every message they get\u2014a laborious process, as tweets and Facebook posts can pile up fast\u2014and often must check with lawyers before sending out replies.\n\n\u201cSocial media is just not the silver bullet for getting fast service,\u201d says Dan Phelps, who leads social media at fund company T. Rowe Price.\n\nFund companies say they are trying to find ways to get more responsive through social media. Until they hit upon the perfect formula for balancing rapid support with regulatory compliance, there are strategies investors can use to make sure their messages get the most prompt attention possible:\n\n1. Ask one question at a time. Mr. Phelps says that T. Rowe has an average response time of around 1.5 hours. Some users, annoyed, \u201csend another tweet and another tweet and another,\u201d he says. That means \u201cwe have to run back to legal, checking over the new questions, which snowballs and makes our response take even longer.\u201d\n\nSo, it\u2019s best to stick with the initial question\u2014and, as tough as it is, be patient. Companies note that for urgent questions, the phone is still best. Likewise, social-media questions about what phone number to call for help are usually answered much faster than more complex ones. At Fidelity Investments, customer-service questions from social media are typically answered by the firm\u2019s large electronic-response team, trained to handle quickly requests about such issues as the best phone number to call. Its smaller social-media team handles education and outreach questions, says Lori Johnson, vice president of online strategies at Fidelity.\n\n2. Don\u2019t get too specific. Companies also prioritize posts that ask general questions, such as the benefits of \u201c529\u201d plans or the best way to balance paying down debt while saving for retirement, says Ms. Johnson. They tend to avoid answering questions that get into someone\u2019s particular financial situation.\n\nFirms also note that they don\u2019t give out financial or investment advice, such as what fund to invest in. Instead, they seek to provide education and guidance, such as commentary on the market.\n\n3. Keep personal information private. The minute you make a public post about mutual funds, you might be a target for marketers. \u201cSomeone who has the funds to have a mutual fund? That person is a prime candidate to market to,\u201d says David Gerzof Richard, founder of Boston marketing firm BIGfish and a professor of marketing at Emerson College.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nHe says not to post anything that online marketers can use to pitch you. In particular, keep your contact details, such as your phone number, email and especially your personal mailing address private, he says. Marketers can use that data to send you tailored advertisements for their products. While these aren\u2019t necessarily dangers, they are annoying and creepy, he says.\n\n4. Be wary of group advice. \u201cIn the old days, you may have only had the advice of your local financial adviser and a relative; now you have like-minded consumers and financial experts all over the world,\u201d says Dave Carlson, a vice president at public-relations firm FleishmanHillard who consults on social media.\n\nBut the world\u2019s advice can be off-base. So it\u2019s best for investors to wait until the experts weigh in before they make any important decisions.\n\nFidelity\u2019s Ms. Johnson says the firm monitors user conversations on its social networks and flags information that might be wrong. For instance, \u201cone day, the market might be up but a customer notices a significant price decrease with one of the mutual funds they hold,\u201d she says. \u201cIn that instance, we are able to reach out to them on social and explain that the price of the mutual fund was adjusted due to a distribution of capital gains and/or dividends.\u201d\n\n5. Keep emotions out of it. Firms say they tend to skip inquiries that contain profanity or inappropriate, insulting language. Those messages are hidden or deleted. So if you want a response\u2014and want others on social media to see it\u2014keep your cool.\n\nMr. Wells is a news editor for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

And more changes are likely before the rules take effect in October 2016.\n\nAs a result, investors used to ignoring that part of their portfolio might suddenly have to pay attention instead, say financial advisers and analysts.\n\nThe SEC regulations aim to prevent an investor exodus from money-market funds like the one that happened during the 2008 financial crisis, when the federal government had to step in with financial backing for the industry.\n\nOne requirement under the new rules is that the shares of money-market funds that cater to institutional investors and invest in corporate or municipal debt must float in value, like the shares of most other mutual funds. That\u2019s a change from the stable $1-a-share value traditionally maintained by all money-market funds. The idea is that investors will be aware of changes in asset values as they occur and be able to adjust their holdings accordingly, rather than stampeding out of funds when they suddenly become aware that their shares aren\u2019t worth $1.\n\nAnother big change is that all money-market funds that invest in corporate or municipal debt will be allowed to charge investors a fee to redeem shares when the funds are under pressure or temporarily block investors from withdrawing cash.\n\nThese rule changes won\u2019t apply to funds that invest only in the debt of the federal government and agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nIn reaction to the new regulations, Fidelity said in February that it plans to convert its largest money-market fund, the $111 billion Fidelity Cash Reserves fund, from a \u201cprime\u201d fund\u2014one that invests in both government and highly rated corporate debt\u2014to one that invests only in U.S. government and agency debt. Some other Fidelity prime money-market funds are slated for the same conversion.\n\nFederated, meanwhile, said some of its funds will begin investing only in debt that matures in 60 days or less, to make it easier to maintain a stable net asset value of $1 a share.\n\nHere\u2019s what investors need to know as changes in money-market funds continue to unfold.\n\n1. Understand types of funds\n\nMoney funds can be divided into three categories according to their investments: prime funds; \u201cgovernment\u201d funds, which invest in U.S. government and federal agency debt; and municipal funds, which invest in the debt of state and local governments.\n\nThe new rules will create another distinction: Many money funds now mingle the investments of institutional and individual, or retail, investors. But because the new rules make a distinction between institutional and retail investors, fund companies are working toward separate institutional and retail funds. Retail funds will be open only to individual investors and accounts where end users are individuals, but institutional funds will be open to both institutional investors and individuals.\n\nNancy Prior of Fidelity: \u2018It\u2019s a simplification of the product lineup.\u2019 Photo: Fidelity Investments\n\nUnderstanding all these distinctions is important because institutional funds will be subject to more rule changes than retail funds, and government funds will be subject to fewer changes than prime or municipal funds. Those differences in the new rules will drive the changes fund companies make in their funds\u2019 investments and structure.\n\nFor instance, Nancy Prior, president of Fidelity\u2019s fixed-income division, says the firm realized after extensive outreach to investors that a stable net asset value and no restrictions on withdrawing cash were most important to clients. \u201cWe wanted to maintain those features,\u201d she says. And that\u2019s why the firm plans to make Fidelity Cash Reserves a government fund\u2014its value won\u2019t have to float and Fidelity won\u2019t be able to stand in the way of investors who want out.\n\n2. Know what you want\n\nMoney funds are yielding little\u2014currently an average of 0.03% a year, or $3 on a $10,000 investment, according to Crane Data LLC, a money-fund research company. But government and municipal funds typically yield even less than prime funds. That\u2019s because prime funds are able to invest in a wider range of securities.\n\nThat leaves investors with a choice: Should they invest in a fund that could earn more but be more risky, or put money in a safer fund that will probably yield less? Many investors will confront that choice as their funds switch from prime to government funds.\n\nLiam Hurley, a principal at Summit Financial Strategies Inc., a $900 million wealth manager in Columbus, Ohio, says he has about $115 million of client money invested in Fidelity Cash Reserves but isn\u2019t concerned that the change to a government fund could mean the fund will yield less.\n\n\u201cWe want to be in funds that are going to be the highest quality and most liquid, and we\u2019d give up yield to have those,\u201d he says.\n\nInvestors also should decide whether they care if a money fund floats like a typical mutual fund\u2014meaning its value fluctuates every day\u2014or if they would rather be in a fund with a stable net asset value. Remember that only institutional prime and municipal funds, which are currently open to individuals, will be required to float.\n\n3. Watch the paperwork\n\nFidelity and Federated are also merging several of their money funds, meaning some funds will cease to exist.\n\nTypically, this should be an easy process for investors, who will automatically be moved into the new fund, with no tax implications, fund companies say. But investors should make sure the new fund is investing in the same way. In the case of Fidelity, the funds being merged have \u201cvery similar mandates,\u201d says Ms. Prior, except in one case where a prime fund will be merged into a government fund. \u201cIt\u2019s a simplification of the product lineup,\u201d she says.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the coming changes at both fund companies are subject to shareholder approval, which means investors should be receiving a flurry of proxies from the funds in the coming months, asking them to vote on the various proposals.\n\nMs. Grind is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News\n\nAs millions of borrowers struggle to stay current on their federal student loans, more private partners are stepping up to help.\n\nMore than 40 companies, including Fidelity Investments and Rite-Aid Corp. , as well as universities and nonprofits, have answered a call by the White House urging private and public institutions to join efforts to help borrowers better manage their student-loan debt. Dubbed the Student Debt Challenge, the campaign seeks to spread the word about, and enroll more borrowers in a suite of programs that allow borrowers to cap their monthly payments according to the size of their income.\n\nThe Obama administration has struggled since 2009 to enroll student-loan borrowers\u2014roughly one-in-four of whom are behind on their payments or in default, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2014in such plans. The idea behind the Student Debt Challenge, then, is for companies, nonprofits and other organizations to help better inform and increase enrollment among the affected members of their communities, says Kevin Fudge, manager of consumer advocacy and government relations at American Student Assistance, a nonprofit focused on college affordability and student-loan repayment.\n\nFidelity executives have been concerned for several years about elevated student-loan debt and its effect on their employees and customers, says Jennifer Hanson, the head of associate experience and benefits at Fidelity. For instance, research indicates that student-loan borrowers struggle to save for retirement, a major part of Fidelity\u2019s business.\n\nFidelity announced earlier this year that it would pay $2,000 a year\u2014up to a maximum of $10,000 per borrower\u2014toward the student loans of anyone employed at the company for more than six months. So far, more than 5,700 borrowers are taking advantage. Fidelity estimates that the company has saved its workers $5 million in principal and interest so far.\n\nFidelity also is working on reaching out to borrowers outside the company. Ms. Hanson says Fidelity Labs, an in-house incubator for new products and services, is working on something to help borrowers explore repayment options and federal programs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for folks to navigate all the different repayment options,\u201d Ms. Hanson says. \u201cFor us,\u201d she adds, \u201cit\u2019s really about thinking about framing student loans in the context of other financial priorities like retirement.\u201d\n\nRite-Aid\u2019s communication effort relies on a tool that is very important to its more than 89,000 employees: their pay stubs. The company plans to include information about the government\u2019s income-based option, called the Pay as You Earn program, with workers\u2019 pay stubs twice a year.\n\nSeveral universities have committed to educating both students and staff about loan-repayment options. The State University of New York, which has 1.4 million students and employees, is holding events on its campuses and advertising its online financial-literacy tool, which includes a section on income-based repayment plans.\n\nWhen the school launched the platform on its campus websites in the 2013-14 academic year, making sure borrowers were aware of their repayment options was of tantamount importance, says Patricia Thompson, SUNY\u2019s assistant vice chancellor for student financial aid services.\n\n\u201cIt would break your heart to think that somebody could find themselves in a delinquent situation when they could have absolutely gone to one of those income-driven repayment plans,\u201d she says.\n\nFor years, student-loan advocates have expressed concern that companies the government hires to manage the repayment process aren\u2019t doing enough to inform borrowers of their options. In this environment, scams have proliferated. Some companies lure desperate borrowers into paying fees to enroll in the income-based plans\u2014a service the government offers for free\u2014with promises to eliminate or slash their debt.\n\nBorrowers need trusted sources of information about repayment plans, says Mr. Fudge, who says his nonprofit intends to contact at least one million borrowers, focusing specifically on older borrowers.\n\nNot everyone agrees, however, that income-based repayment plans are the best alternative for all borrowers. Such plans lower one\u2019s monthly payment, for example, but not the total owed. Indeed, lowering the monthly payment tends to increase the amount paid in interest because it extends the repayment term of the loan, says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Cappex.com, a college and scholarship search site.\n\nMr. Kantrowitz is critical of the government\u2019s approach at publicizing the repayment options. He says, for example, that government documents don\u2019t emphasize to borrowers that the income-based plan can increase one\u2019s debt. While income-driven repayment is useful as \u201ca safety net\u201d for those who cannot afford their current monthly payments, Mr. Kantrowitz says he worries that the plans are being advertised too much as a desirable option.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an ideal option, but it\u2019s better than defaulting on the loan,\u201d he says.\n\nAnother concern of Mr. Kantrowitz\u2019s: While federal repayment programs offer debt forgiveness after 20 or 25 years of repayment, borrowers may not be aware that they will be taxed on the forgiven debt.\n\nUnless a borrower qualifies for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, a program that allows borrowers working for the government or certain types of nonprofits to have their loans forgiven after 10 years of repayment, they should be using the repayment program that allows them to make the highest monthly payment they can afford, Mr. Kantrowitz says.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be in repayment ideally more than 10 years and you want to pay off your debt as quickly as you can and save the most on interest,\u201d he says. That being said, he adds, \u201cif your total debt exceeds your annual income, you\u2019re probably going to need an income-driven repayment plan.\u201d\n\nMr. Fudge agrees that income-driven plans may not be right for borrowers in every circumstance. But, depending on their situation, he says, borrowers can use income-driven plans to their advantage by switching between repayment programs. He cites a recent discussion he had with a borrower who had both federal and private loans but limited means to pay them off. Mr. Fudge says he suggested the borrower use an income-driven plan to lower his payments on his federal loans so that he could devote more money toward paying off the private loans, which had high interest rates. Once he paid those off, the borrower could switch back to a repayment plan with a shorter term, if he wanted.\n\n\u201cThe design behind the policy is to promote flexibility,\u201d he says, \u201cbut unfortunately it\u2019s also very confusing.\u201d\n\nMs. Berman is a reporter for MarketWatch in New York.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fears-about-target-funds-1425870191", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Illustration: Chris Lyons\n\nRetirement-plan investors often aren\u2019t sure how to allocate the money they\u2019re socking away in their 401(k) accounts. So the rise of target-date funds\u2014which automatically shift investors\u2019 money from stocks to fixed income gradually over the years\u2014has been widely heralded as a victory for the country\u2019s retirement readiness.\n\nIndeed, many employer-sponsored retirement plans now use target-date funds as their default option when employees are automatically enrolled. Target-date funds are expected to hold about 35% of total 401(k) assets by 2019, up from 13.5% in 2013, according to Cerulli Associates, a research firm based in Boston.\n\nBut is this really a good thing?\n\nNot necessarily, say some observers, who worry that some investors who don\u2019t fully understand these funds might take on more risk than they want.\n\nThe target-date approach was tested in the 2008 financial crisis, and many investors were surprised by the declines in their funds. For example, funds with a 2010 target date lost 30% on average in 2008, with losses ranging as high as 41%, Securities and Exchange Commission member Luis A. Aguilar said in a speech to a retirement-planning summit in Washington last month.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re not infallible\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat we saw in 2008 is that they\u2019re not infallible,\u201d says analyst Kathryn Spica at fund tracker Morningstar Inc., speaking of the funds.\n\nThat experience should have served as a wake-up call for investors, Mr. Aguilar said.\n\n\u201cThe relentless growth in target-date funds is troubling because studies have shown that investors and industry professionals alike do not fully appreciate the risk these funds present,\u201d Mr. Aguilar said. He cited as one example a 2012 study, sponsored by the SEC, on investors\u2019 understanding of target-date funds. It found only 36% of respondents were aware that these funds don\u2019t provide guaranteed income after retirement.\n\nJoe Nagengast, a partner at consulting firm Target Date Analytics LLC, points to another concern. He says investors should be aware that target-date funds can have confusing names.\n\nFor instance, a fund labeled 2040 might not complete the shift in its portfolio toward more-conservative investments until 2045 or 2050, Mr. Nagengast says. That extended \u201cglide path\u201d could leave some investors more exposed to risk than they would like at the time of their retirement, he says.\n\nBouncing Back\n\nProponents say target-date funds keep investors on track, preventing overreactions to market volatility. And, some argue, while target-date funds aren\u2019t immune to declines, their ability to recover rapidly from downturns means they remain a good deal for investors.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nA report published in September by Charles Schwab Corp. , which manages several target-date funds, said funds with end dates of 2010 and 2040 both performed well after the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cMost of them recovered their full principal by 2010, before the S&P 500 itself recovered,\u201d says Jake Gilliam, the report\u2019s author, a senior portfolio manager at Charles Schwab Investment Management in Cleveland.\n\nThe Schwab report says that on average, $100,000 in a fund at the end of 2007 with a retirement target between 2036 and 2040\u2014aimed at younger investors, who have many years until retirement\u2014would have become $123,327 by the end of 2013. For a fund with a 2000 to 2010 retirement date, $100,000 at the end of 2007 would have become $125,833 on average by the end of 2013, Schwab says.\n\nMaking a Choice\n\nStill, it\u2019s important for investors to make an informed decision about whether to invest their 401(k) money in a target-date fund or in other options.\n\nThe first step in evaluating a target-date fund, Morningstar\u2019s Ms. Spica says, is to check the prospectus to determine the glide path\u2014the changes in allocations over time\u2014to make sure the fund is taking an amount of risk over the years that the investor is comfortable with.\n\nInvestors should be aware that target-date funds take one of two basic approaches: The \u201cto retirement\u201d funds finish their allocation changes by the investor\u2019s projected retirement date, while \u201cthrough retirement\u201d funds continue to switch from stocks into fixed income until a later date, often at age 72, says Erik Daley, managing principal at Multnomah Group, a consulting firm for retirement plans. Knowing which of those approaches a fund takes is crucial in deciding whether it matches an investor\u2019s risk tolerance.\n\nAs with any fund, investors should also be aware of fees. The largest providers of target-date funds\u2014 T. Rowe Price Group, Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group\u2014all offer low-fee funds, either actively managed or passive and index-based, Ms. Spica says. Investors should seek out funds with expense ratios below the average, which was 0.84% for target-date funds at the end of 2013, she says.\n\nTypically, 401(k) plans offer a series of target-date funds from the same fund company, so investors who can\u2019t find one with low fees and their preferred risk profile might prefer to do things the old-fashioned way\u2014invest in the stock and bond funds their plan offers and commit to doing the rebalancing in the years ahead themselves.\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-social-media-can-feed-investors-panic-1450062199", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "It isn\u2019t always good to know what other investors are thinking.\n\nIn recent years, a branch of scientists known as neuroeconomists have discovered a connection between a person\u2019s ability to recognize what others are thinking and how well that same person\u2019s investment portfolio will likely perform in the next market crash. And the connection is not a positive one.\n\nThe ability to make inferences about someone else\u2019s mind is normally seen as a crucial mental talent. It facilitates social interactions and empathy. But in a 2013 paper published in the scientific journal Neuron by Benedetto De Martino and colleagues, then at the California Institute of Technology, the authors uncovered a surprising downside to this most human skill.\n\nThe scientists observed that in tests that measure one\u2019s ability to infer another person\u2019s state of mind\u2014a so-called theory-of-mind test\u2014subjects who performed well also showed patterns of brain activity associated with increased betting during bubble markets. The authors suggest that over time this could lead to greater financial losses.\n\nWhat explains this correlation? One possibility is that investors who are more attuned to the behavior of others are more prone to herd behavior. When they notice someone bidding up a given asset, or panicking and selling after the bubble has popped, they are more likely to join in that activity, even when the price of the asset deviates greatly from its intrinsic value. For these sensitive people, irrational exuberance, and panics, are extremely contagious.\n\nSuch theories raise an especially important question in the 21st century. We live, after all, in the age of the social network, with hundreds of millions of people interacting on sites such as Facebook and Twitter. While these sites make it far easier for people to learn about one another, they might also make us more sensitive to market swings.\n\nPhoto: Muhaciov Artiom/Getty Images\n\nAn informal survey I\u2019ve conducted with investors in my own social network suggests that most financial firms have yet to develop a coherent strategy to deal with this type of vulnerability. When I asked people if they\u2019d been contacted by their financial institution or adviser after the last sharp market correction in August, almost everyone said their financial institution was \u201cnot effective\u201d in helping reduce their anxiety about market events.\n\nThe question is what an effective response would look like. One potential solution is personalized text messages to deliver customized content in the midst of a sudden downturn. Studies show that personalized information is far better at grabbing our scarce attention, whether in the classroom or our inbox.\n\nAfter a market correction, these personalized messages could be pushed directly to investors\u2019 smartphones, attempting to calm people by describing relevant academic research. For example, the messages could emphasize that most investors aren\u2019t good at market timing.\n\nFirms might also focus their interventions on clients who score higher on tests showing their susceptibility to other people\u2019s behavior, as they might be most susceptible to bubbles and busts.\n\nAnother possible solution involves a commitment contract, or an agreement designed to help a person achieve goals. Studies have shown that smokers are more likely to quit when they commit to giving six months of their savings to charity if they fail a test for nicotine. A similar strategy could be used to prevent impulsive selloffs. Perhaps investors should sign an agreement with their financial advisers requiring that, after a market downturn, they have to run five miles before deciding to sell. (A wearable gadget could be the referee.)\n\nTexts and commitment contracts won\u2019t prevent the next panic. But financial firms should develop digital tools to help clients deal with their impulsive emotions. When investors are flooded with bad news it\u2019s important to help them put their feelings in a broader context. Instead of following the herd, they should follow history: Buy and hold is still a great long-term strategy.\n\nDr. Benartzi is a professor and co-chair of the Behavioral Decision Making Group at the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles, and author of \u201cThe Smarter Screen: Surprising Ways to Influence and Improve Online Behavior.

Illustration: James Steinberg for The Wall Street Journal\n\nHow well do you remember the last financial crisis? Can you clearly recall what happened to your finances?\n\nMost people are pretty confident in the accuracy of their memories. Unfortunately, decades of research suggest their confidence is likely misplaced. And that overconfidence can cost them, especially as they age.\n\nThe human brain isn\u2019t like a computer hard drive; rather, it is full of quirks and blind spots, which can make it difficult for investors to remember exactly how much the S&P 500 lost between 2007 and 2009. (Answer: the S&P lost more than 50% of its value.) These blind spots can have serious consequences, leading people to take far more risk than they can actually afford.\n\nNew research suggests that the distortions and gaps in our memory change as we get older. While most people assume that our memory simply gets worse over time, the reality is more subtle and complicated. Older adults have more experience, and perhaps the benefit of perspective, but they also have to deal with specific biases that influence the details of what they remember.\n\nBias for good news\n\nConsider a study led by one of us (Dr. Castel), which showed subjects a series of faces paired with a specific monetary gain or loss. For instance, a brunette\u2019s face might appear with a loss of $100, while a man with a goatee might come with a gain of $50. As expected, both young and old subjects were more likely to remember the pairings when they were associated with bigger monetary amounts.\n\nHowever, interesting age-related differences emerged when the scientists looked at how well young and old people remembered gains and losses. While the young undergraduates were most likely to remember big losses, the older cohort\u2014the group had an average age of 78-\u2014did relatively better when shown faces paired with large gains. When it came to the largest losses, the senior citizens were approximately 25% less likely to recall the face-pairing than the young adults.\n\nThis finding builds on previous research showing that older adults pay more attention to positive information, like gains, suggesting a bias for good news built into the aging process. In addition, older adults also showed a recency effect, as they did relatively better when asked to recall money-face pairings they had just seen.\n\nFinancial autopilots\n\nTaken together, this new research raises some important questions about how our memory might impact financial decision making as we get older.\n\nWhile more research is needed in this area, the current evidence suggests that older adults might have unique blind spots related to risk, especially if the market has been on an upswing in recent years. Because older adults show a bias toward gains and tend to remember the latest events, a bull market might lead them to forget about the last bear. Such forgetting can lead to serious decision-making mistakes. Unless we remember the lessons of the last crisis\u2014what it felt like to watch as our portfolio was slashed in half\u2014then we are bound to take excessive risk.\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nOne way to deal with these potential pitfalls is to rely on financial autopilots. If you\u2019re still accumulating assets, then target-date funds could work well, as those funds automatically adjust portfolio allocations as investors get older. If you are already drawing down assets to pay for living expenses, then annuities provide an autopilot solution for your paycheck. (Purchasing an annuity is often an irreversible decision, however, so getting help is a good idea.)\n\nSuch financial autopilots help counteract the positivity bias of old age, in which we pay less attention to our losses. It\u2019s good to remember the good times, but forgetting about the bad can cost us money.\n\nDr. Benartzi, a frequent contributor to the Journal Reports, is a professor and co-head of the behavioral decision making group at UCLA Anderson School of Management and author of \u201cThe Smarter Screen\u201d about online behavior.

Photo: UCLA\n\nFund guides such as Morningstar\u2019s popular rating system of one to five stars appeal to fund buyers because they transform complicated data into an easy-to-understand metric: A five-star fund is superior to a four-star fund, which is superior to a three-star fund, and so on.\n\nThe problem is, most traditional ratings guides don\u2019t take into account who is doing the shopping. They assume every investor feels the same way about losing money when, in fact, behavioral economists in recent years have discovered a surprising amount of variation in how people feel about losses. As a result, fund-grading systems have the potential to provide misleading guidance to those whose loss tolerance falls outside the norm\u2014which some recent research shows could be as many as half of all investors.\n\nTo address this fundamental flaw and help people make smarter investment decisions, we have developed a system for measuring sensitivity to financial losses. Our calculator is free, and investors can use it to determine how much attention, if any, they should pay to ratings when evaluating funds. We also believe this tool, or one like it, eventually could be used by ratings providers to create customized fund rankings that take into account each individual\u2019s feelings about money losses.\n\nCoin-flip test\n\nMuch of the research into risky choices has focused on loss aversion, which refers to the fact that losses tend to hurt more than gains feel good. (See work by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky on risky choice behavior.) The easiest way to demonstrate loss aversion is to ask people whether they would accept the following bet on a coin flip: If the coin lands on heads, you\u2019ll win $200. If it lands on tails, you\u2019ll lose $100. (This hypothetical was first introduced by Nobel Laureate Paul Samuelson.) Do you take the bet?\n\nMost people reject the offer, even if the math strongly suggests they should say yes. For these people, the potential pain of losing $100 exceeds the pleasure of winning twice that amount.\n\nThat said, not everyone feels the same way about the coin flip. Although the average loss-aversion coefficient is just over two\u2014meaning that losses hurt twice as much as gains feel good\u2014recent research by Duke University Prof. John Payne and his colleagues found that about half of subjects significantly deviate from the population average. Some have significantly higher loss-magnifying coefficients, meaning they are even more sensitive to the possibility of losing money. And, some have coefficients approaching one, which means they treat losses as nearly identical to gains. They seek out bets that are much more balanced in terms of possible gains versus possible losses. (A fraction of the population, approximately one in 10, is gain seeking, which is the opposite of loss aversion.)\n\nHere\u2019s how feelings about losses might skew fund ratings for investors: Say you\u2019re extremely loss-averse, with a coefficient around five. (You require a gain of $500 to make up for a potential $100 loss.) A highly rated fund might still feel too risky to you.\n\nThe same problem applies in the opposite direction. For investors who are less sensitive to losses, fund ratings might overemphasize the emotional toll of losses. Because these people aren\u2019t bothered as much by losses, they might prefer funds with higher potential returns, even if it means more dramatic ups and downs.\n\nIt\u2019s subjective\n\nIt is possible to quickly identify an individual\u2019s loss-aversion coefficient with our calculator. (In the future, we hope other scientific calculators that measure key aspects of risk tolerance, and loss aversion in particular, are developed and made available to the public.) If you have a loss-aversion coefficient around two, then a traditional fund-rating system will probably provide you with acceptable guidance. But if your coefficient is either close to one or above three, then ratings guides might lead you to consider funds that don\u2019t fit your actual levels of loss tolerance.\n\nOnce a person\u2019s loss-aversion coefficient is known, it should be possible to personalize investment ratings, ensuring that the highest-rated funds match an investor\u2019s actual preferences. Countless websites and apps, from Amazon.com to Netflix, deliver personalized content to users based on their Internet shopping and browsing histories, so the technology to do this clearly exists. Over time, such personalization could minimize decision-making mistakes triggered by loss aversion, helping people make smarter investment choices.\n\nFeelings about losses might skew fund ratings for investors.

Morningstar believes \u201cattitudes toward risk should contribute far more to asset allocation and portfolio construction than to fund choice,\u201d says Jeffrey Ptak, head of manager research at the firm. Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual-fund and ETF research at S&P Capital IQ, says his firm\u2019s research tools incorporate risk considerations at both the fund and holdings level, which allows investors to more easily sort through the universe of highly ranked funds for the best fit.\n\nStill, we would argue that because risk is a subjective feeling, with different people experiencing the trade-offs between gains and losses in different ways, any attempt to offer guidance based on an investment\u2019s historic level of risk should reflect these individual preferences. Only then will every investor be able to identify the funds that best suit their own psychological reality.\n\nDr. Benartzi is a professor and co-head of the behavioral decision-making group at UCLA Anderson School of Management, and author of \u201cThe Smarter Screen\u201d about online behavior.

Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News\n\nIt\u2019s a fact of life: Homes come with far more emotional weight than any other investment we make.\n\nA home is a refuge from the world, a place to raise a family and, for some people, an investment they hope will bring them a good chunk of money down the road. We fall in love with houses in a way that we never fall in love with a portfolio of stocks and bonds.\n\nAll too often, though, we don\u2019t realize that how we feel about homes blinds us when it comes time to buy or sell. We let our emotions blind us to cold facts about the market or the realities of ownership. Or we prioritize one set of emotional needs over others that are just are strong but may not be evident at first. And ignoring them can lead us to make bad financial decisions that can affect us for decades to come.\n\nFor instance, people might focus on their desire for a house that\u2019s a certain size or style, but ignore the fact that they want to spend as much time as possible with family. So they might buy a \u201cperfect\u201d house that requires them to make a long daily commute to work and keeps them away from home for two extra hours each day.\n\nThe home-selling side of the equation brings its own set of thorny issues. Homeowners often have an overly rosy view of their home and expect it to increase in value far beyond reasonable expectations. And when they put it on the market, they often stubbornly cling to their asking price\u2014even if it means leaving it up for sale far longer than they planned, and risking the possibility of not selling it at all.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at some psychological missteps that buyers and sellers often make as they wade into the housing market.\n\nIgnoring the big picture\n\nHome buyers are always on the lookout for features\u2014like a longer driveway or bigger backyard\u2014that will make them happier with their home. But people don\u2019t realize that those changes may not make them happier with their life as a whole.\n\n\u201cWhen people move to a better housing, they think they will be a lot happier overall,\u201d says Shige Oishi, a co-author of a 2010 study on the subject in Social Indicators Research. \u201cWhen they actually move, however, their overall happiness does not often change because there are many trade-offs in moving.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest trade-offs is commuting. Many move to live in a bigger house, but that bigger house is often farther away from work\u2014so that means more commuting, which tends to add stress and detract from overall happiness. A 2008 study in the Scandinavian Journal of Economics shows that people who had longer commutes reported \u201clower subjective well-being\u201d than those with shorter commutes. \u201cIf you\u2019re moving to a place far away from your friends, but it has nicer stuff, it\u2019s not a great deal for your happiness,\u201d says Elizabeth Dunn, a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia.\n\nIn another study in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, Ms. Dunn and her co-authors explored the matter of expectations vs. reality in another way\u2014by looking at Harvard undergraduates who were randomly assigned to different dormitories. The study showed that first-year students incorrectly predicted what would bring them the most satisfaction from their dorms\u2014physical features like location on campus, the attractiveness of the residence, room size and desirability of the dining hall and facilities.\n\nIn the initial survey, the students put no weight on social features, such as relationships with roommates and a sense of community in the residence. But when the researchers checked back in with the students after they\u2019d been living in their dorms, the only thing that appeared to matter for their happiness was the quality of the social factors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to get caught up in comparing the physical features of the places you\u2019re looking at,\u201d says Ms. Dunn, \u201cbut you should really stop to consider how the places you\u2019re considering will shape your social relationships.\u201d\n\nOverlooking big expenses\n\nPeople who are buying homes tend to compartmentalize their expenses and not add up the total cost of everything needed to fix up and furnish the house, says Alex Tabarrok, a professor of economics at George Mason University. That can lead them to make poor choices about how much to pay for a home. For instance, they may overspend on a down payment for the house itself and leave themselves without enough money to buy the sort of decorations or furniture that they want. \u201cWhen you\u2019re getting a house, think about furnishing it at the same time,\u201d says Mr. Tabarrok.\n\nWeighing buying vs. renting\n\nThe biggest budgeting concern is, of course, whether you should buy a house at all. Research shows there are psychological benefits to taking the plunge\u2014but also to opting out.\n\nBuying a house can give people a psychological boost by making them feel like they\u2019ve \u201carrived\u201d and are part of the American ideal. Homeowners also may feel as though they have more control over their lives since they\u2019re not dependent on the whims of a fickle landlord.\n\nBut while those factors may lead people into buying a house, there are other negative elements that homeowners don\u2019t discover until after they\u2019ve taken the plunge.\n\nResearch, for instance, has shown that home ownership can cause undue stress. The amount of work necessary to maintain a home\u2014such as decorating, or mowing the lawn every weekend\u2014may be too much for some people. Others may be overwhelmed by the financial aspect of ownership, such as being tied to a big monthly mortgage, or keeping up with repairs and other unforeseen costs.\n\nExpecting a big return\n\nWhen it comes to selling a home, most people aren't in for a huge payday. Yet many are overly optimistic in their home-price expectations, according to Robert J. Shiller.\n\nDr. Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale University, co-wrote a paper, updated in 2014, that looked at the ways recent home buyers around the country think about the future values of their properties.\n\nUsing questionnaire surveys, Mr. Shiller and his co-authors found, among other things, that home buyers have extremely high long-term price expectations. That can lead people to buy homes that aren\u2019t a good fit in terms of location or social scene just because they seem like good investments. Or they may stake their plans\u2014such as retirement\u2014on a certain return and find themselves scrambling when they come up short. On a larger scale, this over-optimism can lead to speculative booms that warp the market.\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t entirely clear why homeowners are usually so cheerful about the future, the researchers postulate it may result from the \u201cmoney illusion\u201d\u2014a failure to take inflation into account.\n\n\u201cImagine that your grandmother dies, and you\u2019re managing her estate,\u201d Mr. Shiller says. \u201cHer house is worth $30,000 now, and you look at what she paid\u2014$5,000. You think, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s a lot.\u2019 Now why does it seem so big? Because you\u2019re not reflecting that all prices went up sixfold\u201d and you\u2019re basically not making a profit after taking inflation into account.\n\nNot wanting to come up short\n\nPeople have many reasons for selling their homes, and for setting the prices they do. But research has found that the most powerful emotional drive at work in a sale is loss aversion\u2014not wanting to sell a home for less than what you paid for it.\n\nIn a study in The Quarterly Journal of Economics, researchers found that homeowners latch on to the price they paid for their home with the hope that they can get more when they put it on the market. But that isn\u2019t the soundest idea, says Christopher Mayer, a co-author of the study and a professor of real estate and economics at Columbia Business School, especially if your house has depreciated in value. It\u2019s a fallacy to assume that you\u2019ll be able to recoup losses you\u2019ve already incurred. The current market price has nothing to do with how much a person actually paid for it.\n\nThere is a nuance here, though. People who stubbornly stick to an asking price above market value risk not selling their house at all. But sometimes they are rewarded.\n\nMr. Mayer and a co-author analyzed housing data from downtown Boston in the 1990s, culled from a boom-bust cycle. Condominium owners who put their houses up for sale above the market rate\u2014though still below what they paid for them\u2014sold their homes for more than expected, even as their properties lingered on the market for longer than usual.\n\nMr. Kassel is a writer in New York.

Photo: Peter Foley/Bloomberg News\n\nSmart beta? Just smart marketing, says Burton G. Malkiel.\n\nMr. Malkiel, the economist known for being one of the biggest proponents of index investing, continues to be among the skeptics of these popular mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, which blur the lines between active and passive management.\n\nThe \u201cbeta\u201d part of the name refers to an index, or an index fund\u2019s, return. The \u201csmart\u201d part means that the funds weight stocks in an index based on factors such as low volatility, high quality or high momentum (rather than on market value like a typical index fund) in a bid to produce better returns.\n\n\u201cIn that [smart beta] does enhance returns, it\u2019s likely because the portfolios have additional risk,\u201d Mr. Malkiel says in an interview. \u201cIt isn\u2019t some smart new way to outperform on a risk-adjusted basis.\u201d\n\nA fee grab?\n\nAs of March 31, nearly $575 billion was invested in smart-beta funds, an increase of 37% in just over two years, according to Morningstar Inc. Mr. Malkiel says smart beta is just a new way for fund managers to justify higher fees. As a group, funds with low turnover, and therefore more tax-efficiency, and the lowest fees\u2014such as index funds\u2014will continue to outperform other funds, he says.\n\nEven before index funds existed, the now-retired Princeton University professor argued that they could outperform actively managed funds\u2014and that a blindfolded monkey could, too. That argument is part of his book, \u201cA Random Walk Down Wall Street,\u201d first published 43 years ago.\n\nIn an updated edition that came out this year, he devotes a chapter to smart-beta strategies and concludes they aren\u2019t right for individual investors. Not only are they riskier, but all smart-beta funds have had long periods of underperforming the stock market, he writes.\n\nDividend push\n\nMr. Malkiel, chief investment officer at robo-advising firm Wealthfront, made one other major change in the latest edition of his investing classic: He recommends substituting high-yielding stocks, particularly of companies with a history of raising dividends, for part of a bond portfolio given this period of unusually low interest rates. He says that while stocks are generally riskier than bonds, he\u2019s comfortable with this view, even for retired people.\n\nHere\u2019s his thinking: The Federal Reserve is targeting a 2% inflation rate. It is now about 1.6% by the Fed\u2019s preferred measure. If inflation were to rise to 2% and 10-year Treasury yields were to hold steady around 1.7% (yields on shorter maturities are even lower, often under 1%), investors would be losing money after inflation. If interest rates rise\u2014as seems likely over time\u2014the price of those bonds will fall, adding to their losses.\n\n\u201cPeople won't be well served with bond index funds\u201d if yields are under 2%, he says.\n\nHe says he isn\u2019t trying to time the market. Instead he calls this \u201can unusual era of financial repression,\u201d more like the post-World War II period when interest rates were pegged to unusually low levels. And history, he adds, shows that rather than bonds being a risk killer, \u201cit may be one of the riskiest plays you can make.\u201d\n\nMr. Malkiel also is cautious about target-date funds, which scale back holdings of stocks in favor of bonds as a \u201ctarget date\u201d (often retirement) nears.\n\nHe says these funds \u201cmature\u201d around the time an investor turns 65, but he or she could still have another 20 to 30 years of expenses ahead.\n\n\u201cI suspect that a lot of these haven't been quite as aggressive as they could have been,\u201d he says.\n\nMs. Ascarelli is an editor at MarketWatch.

They aim to serve the many investors who take into consideration companies\u2019 environmental, social and corporate-governance, or ESG, standards. These firms are becoming a force in markets, according to John Willis and Carolyn Roose of Sustainable Insight Capital Management, who say some 33% of companies report that inquiries from sustainability analysts have shaped their business strategy.\n\nHow to Invest in Real Estate There are a lot of ways to go about real-estate investment. But typically some combination of four options is considered: VIEW Interactive\n\nBut definitions of sustainability vary widely.\n\n\u201cIn one year, a large industrial company was recognized as a top 10 ESG performer by one data provider and a bottom 10 ESG performer by another,\u201d says John Goldstein, co-founder of Imprint Capital Advisors, which advised clients on socially responsible investing, and now a managing director at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which acquired Imprint last year. \u201cBoth firms had legitimate considerations, and this highlights the fact that large public companies are complex and dynamic in a way that does not lend itself to absolutism.\u201d\n\nStrength in diversity?\n\nJust in the past few months, both Morningstar Inc., in partnership with research firm Sustainalytics, and MSCI Inc. \u2019s MSCI ESG Research have rolled out platforms that rate mutual funds based on their environmental, social and governance characteristics.\n\nThey join other firms in the business like RobecoSAM, which works with S&P Dow Jones Indices, a unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc., to publish a series of sustainability indexes. Meanwhile, the nonprofit Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB, is trying to establish uniform disclosure of sustainability metrics by public companies.\n\nThe organizations differ not only in what type of information they consider pertinent to a company\u2019s sustainability, but also in what specific information they consider material within those parameters. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe there\u2019s one definition of sustainability or materiality,\u201d says Michael Jantzi, chief executive of Sustainalytics. \u201cWhile I think we need to bring some semblance of order, because I understand it\u2019s confusing, I also believe there\u2019s strength in the diversity of opinions.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s an investor to do?\n\nThe best bet, some in the rating business say, is to use any information related to sustainability as a starting point on the path to a judgment, not an end point.\n\nMr. Jantzi says he sees Sustainalytics as an information provider that informs its clients\u2019 decision-making processes. He says his company\u2019s analysts gather information on 4,500 global companies from sources including the companies themselves, social media, nonprofits and the media. These data are then re-examined by firms like Morningstar that make their own determinations around sustainability.\n\n\u201cWe accept the fact that our clients might have different points of view than we do,\u201d Mr. Jantzi says. \u201cWe deliver our insights in a very flexible way.\u201d\n\nDaniel Wild, RobecoSAM\u2019s head of sustainability investing research and development, says that last year his firm sent its annual survey to more than 3,500 companies, asking 100 to 120 questions to assess 20 to 25 criteria related to sustainability. Since only 860 participants filled out the latest survey, RobecoSAM analyzed the remaining companies using publicly available data from the likes of corporate social-responsibility reports and corporate filings that don\u2019t follow set standards for sustainability reporting.\n\nInvestors will have to continue making their own judgments about companies\u2019 sustainability.

No public company has yet used SASB standards in its 10-K, the annual report required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, says Amanda Medress, communications director for the SASB. \u201cHowever, we are aware of more than 50 companies that mention SASB in their sustainability report or corporate website, which may indicate their initial interest,\u201d she says.\n\nMeantime, investors will have to continue making their own judgments\u2014and accept the fact that even people whose job is to sort this out can come to different conclusions.\n\nIn his experience, says Goldman\u2019s Mr. Goldstein, he hasn\u2019t seen \u201ca single diversified equities portfolio, even from the most committed of responsible fund managers,\u201d that didn\u2019t have one surprising holding.\n\nMr. Davidson is a writer in San Francisco.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nWhen elderly parents become victims of a financial scam, it\u2019s often their adult children who are left to pick up the pieces.\n\nDoing so can be time-consuming, costly and stressful. It can be difficult to even discover exactly what happened, especially if parents are embarrassed by the fact that they were victimized or fearful about possible retribution by the scammer, says Michael Liersch, head of behavioral finance at Merrill Lynch Wealth Management in New York.\n\nParents may also deny they\u2019re being victimized and be unwilling to let their children help at all. And in any case it\u2019s often very difficult to recover all of the parents\u2019 money. Still, there are steps children can take to try to limit the damage and protect their parents from being scammed again.\n\nRunning into walls\n\nAbout two years ago, Angie Kennard had a feeling that something was \u201coff\u201d with her then 79-year-old father. During visits and on phone calls, the Fairfax, Va., mother of four says, he would tell her about the \u201cgirlfriend\u201d he met online and would occasionally send money to.\n\nMs. Kennard, who works full time, would ask her father, who was living in Phoenix at the time, about the woman, whom he never met in person. He said the woman would profess her love to him in emails and ask for money to feed her and her daughter.\n\nMs. Kennard says she repeatedly told her father she thought he was being conned and not to send the woman money. He wouldn\u2019t listen, and said he was only sending her small amounts anyway. \u201cHe said he had met the love of his life and they were going to get married,\u201d Ms. Kennard says.\n\nShe was concerned he was giving the scammer all his money, so she asked him to give her power of attorney so that she could act on his behalf to help manage his financial affairs. He refused.\n\n\u201cHe was mad that I was trying to interfere with his personal life, and the scammer made him think that all I wanted was money,\u201d she says.\n\nMs. Kennard decided to seek guardianship of her father\u2019s health and financial affairs, which would enable her to make decisions for him about those issues. During a visit in Phoenix, she had him evaluated by a doctor. But the doctor said he was fine, and lawyers told her she stood no chance of convincing a judge to give her guardianship.\n\nMs. Kennard, who is an only child, tried to get her father to move to Virginia so she could keep a closer eye on him. But he refused.\n\nIt was only when her father was hospitalized after a massive stroke that he gave her power of attorney and she discovered the scam\u2019s extent. On her father\u2019s computer, she found countless emails from the woman asking for money. She also found dozens of receipts from various wire transfers. All told, she says, her father sent the woman more than $700,000 over two years. \u201cHe essentially gave her his life savings,\u201d she says.\n\nEmpathy and action\n\nWhen a parent has been scammed, empathy for the victim is a key initial step to start moving forward in the most productive way, says Mr. Liersch of Merrill Lynch. \u201cSituations where family members are angry at the victim make it more difficult to identify the cause of the victimization, because the victim can shut down,\u201d he says.\n\nFor example, a client of Mr. Liersch told his father what a \u201cgenerous and kind\u201d individual he was after he had fallen for a crook\u2019s request for money. After showing empathy, the client said his father revealed how frightened he felt and shared the story about how he had been fooled.\n\nAs for concrete steps, it\u2019s important to report fraud to the parent\u2019s local police department and file a police report immediately, says John McManus, an attorney in New Providence, N.J. Even if an investigation doesn\u2019t identify the scammer or result in a prosecution, documenting the fraud can be helpful when disputing any account charges, Mr. McManus says.\n\nChildren should help the parent alert credit-card companies, banks and any other financial institutions where the parent has an account, he says. They also should review the parent\u2019s credit reports for suspicious activity. And the parent\u2019s bank accounts, insurance policies and investments should be reviewed to see if there have been any changes in beneficiaries or account ownership, or if loans have been taken out against the policies, Mr. McManus says.\n\nHe also recommends that victims change and unlist their landline and cellphone numbers to help protect against further abuse.\n\nAsking a parent for power of attorney, as Ms. Kennard did, is one way for a child to gain easier access to the parent\u2019s accounts and assert more control over them.\n\nThe limits of power\n\nHowever, as Ms. Kennard found, parents often refuse this request. Many parents resist giving a child power of attorney because they fear giving up control of their finances and their lives, says Suzanne Shier, chief wealth planning and tax strategist at Northern Trust in Chicago.\n\nIn these cases, a parent may be more willing to agree to a so-called springing power of attorney, Ms. Shier says. A springing power of attorney only takes effect when the parent is determined by at least one designated person, generally a physician, to be mentally incapable of managing his or her own affairs. That presents its own problems, because that judgment is subjective and can be difficult to obtain. But at least the child has something in reserve with a springing power of attorney if the parent starts to deteriorate, Ms. Shier says.\n\nPower of attorney granted by a parent who is still competent isn\u2019t foolproof either, says Lawrence Davidow, an elder-care lawyer in Islandia, N.Y. While it will help the child track and manage the parent\u2019s financial life, nothing prevents the parent from continuing to act on his or her own behalf by signing checks or transferring money, he says.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have power of attorney and suspect your parent is being swindled, visit the parent\u2019s bank or branch manager to discuss your concerns, Mr. McManus says. You possess no legal rights to the parent\u2019s financial information, but at least a visit puts the financial institution on notice that there may be a problem and they may be more likely to detect any fraud, he says.\n\nThe last resort\n\nChildren can help prevent parents from being conned in the first place by educating them about possible scams, Ms. Shier says. And regularly communicating with them and noticing any changes in their behavior, such as a sudden fear of losing their home or submissiveness toward a caregiver, can help catch a scam in its early stages, she adds.\n\nUsually seeking guardianship (or a conservatorship as it\u2019s called in some states) of a parent is the last resort, Ms. Shier says. A guardianship is only established when a court determines that an individual is partially or totally incapable of handing their personal and/or financial decisions. There is a rigorous court process that must be followed to implement it, since it involves limiting or terminating a person\u2019s right to make many of their own decisions, Ms. Shier says.\n\nNo resolution\n\nAs soon as she discovered her father was scammed, Ms. Kennard contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation and called a senior-citizens abuse hotline. She also spent countless hours on the phone with various banks and money-wiring companies trying to get her father\u2019s money back and track down the swindlers. But the crooks had used multiple names and accounts, making them impossible to find.\n\nMs. Kennard says the FBI eventually told her that her father had likely been defrauded by a Nigerian-based crime syndicate that had been scamming millions from other senior citizens. (The FBI declined to comment for this article.) Meanwhile, the stroke damaged her father\u2019s memory, leaving him with no recollection of the \u201clady\u201d he had planned to marry or the transfers.\n\nMs. Kennard took four months off from work to handle her dad\u2019s affairs in Phoenix. She packed up his apartment after the stroke to move him closer to her, and spent hours battling insurance companies and navigating Medicare and Medicaid. She also spent weeks trying to find a Medicaid nursing home for him in Virginia, since she couldn\u2019t afford to pay a home aid or remodel her house. Her father died Thursday.\n\nMs. Kennard estimates she spent more than $30,000 trying to help her father. Everyone told her his money is gone forever. \u201cIt makes me very sad and angry,\u201d she says.\n\nMs. Dagher is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York and host of the \u201cWatching Your Wealth\u201d podcast.

But is that 8% increase compounded annually, each year? Or is the 8% only of the full-retirement monthly benefit?\n\nEDWIN CHEN, Bethesda, Md.\n\nThe frequent misstatement of the 8% annual increase in Social Security benefits for those who delay collecting is a pet peeve of mine. The increase in benefits each year from full retirement age to age 70 is 8% of the benefit at full retirement age. That means that each year you delay, your benefit goes up by the same dollar amount\u2014which means that each year, it goes up by a slightly smaller percentage of the benefit you already are entitled to.\n\nConsider a worker who was born between 1943 and 1954 and is entitled to a benefit of $1,000 a month at the full retirement age of 66. If he or she delays the start of Social Security to age 67, the benefit would be 108% of the full-retirement-age benefit, or $1,080.\n\nIf this person starts Social Security at age 68, the benefit would be 116% of the base, or $1,160. That\u2019s 7.4% higher than for starting at age 67. Delaying from 68 to 69 (when the benefit is 124% of the base, or $1,240) is a 6.9% bump. At age 70, our worker would get $1,320, up 6.5% from the benefit starting at 69.\n\nThese figures are all before any annual cost-of-living increases.\n\n***\n\nA previous Encore article on Social Security mentioned that benefits are tied to your 35 years of highest earnings. Is that your earnings up to a cap\u2014and what is the cap? I\u2019m wondering if the cap is the breakpoint where withholding stops.\n\nGENE HARRIES, Phoenix\n\nYes, for each calendar year there is an earnings figure, called the \u201ccontribution and benefit base,\u201d that is significant for two reasons: It is the maximum amount of earnings subject to Social Security taxation. And it is the maximum amount of pay for that year that will be counted in the calculation of your Social Security retirement benefit. The figure for 2015 is $118,500, up from $117,000 last year, based on an index of wage growth in the U.S.\n\nThe earnings cap was just $3,000 when the Social Security program began in 1937.\n\nYour retirement benefit is based on your earnings in your 35 highest-paid years\u2014after the early years\u2019 pay has been adjusted upward based on average wage growth over the decades.\n\nFor an idea of the impact of that inflation adjustment, consider an example on the Social Security website of a hypothetical worker retiring this year at age 66. The worker\u2019s first annual pay covered by Social Security\u2014$14,100 back in 1975\u2014is increased to $66,509 in the benefit calculation.\n\nOf course, your actual payout depends on your retirement age as well as your earnings history. If you retire at full retirement age in 2015, your maximum benefit would be $2,685; at age 62, the maximum benefit would be $2,025.\n\n***\n\nIf a home has appreciated since a reverse mortgage was written, say, from $300,000 to $450,000, can the mortgage be renegotiated so as to extend the payout period? If yes, will it be worth it?\n\nMEYER ROTHBERG, Metuchen, N.J.\n\nIt is possible to refinance a reverse mortgage that was made under the government-backed Home Equity Conversion Mortgage, or HECM, program. A big jump in a home\u2019s value might give the homeowner access to a larger sum of money\u2014including additional payments in the case of a borrower who has already taken all the dollars available under the original loan.\n\nBut changes in the program\u2019s rules over the years will affect just how much additional money is available, and the borrower would have to weigh the benefits against the costs of refinancing.\n\nFor more information, a borrower should talk to his or her lender and/or to a government-approved reverse-mortgage counseling agency. (You can find information on local and national counseling programs on the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s HECM website.)\n\nIf you are looking to refinance, the lender must give you an \u201cantichurning\u201d disclosure form that details the estimated costs and the increase in the loan amount.\n\nEncore welcomes your questions at encore@wsj.com.

But typically some combination of four options is considered: VIEW Interactive\n\nThe top two funds in The Wall Street Journal\u2019s first quarterly contest of this year both do just that. Daniel Peris, manager of the winning Federated Strategic Value Dividend fund (SVAAX), and Michael Morey, co-manager of the runner-up Integrity Dividend Harvest Fund (IDIVX), don\u2019t pay nearly as much attention to the factors that will drive the stock prices of the companies they buy as they do to their dividends.\n\n\u201cWe are not in the stock business; we\u2019re in the business-ownership business,\u201d says Mr. Peris. \u201cInterest rates and the stock market aren\u2019t that relevant to us.\u201d\n\nMr. Peris\u2019s fund captured the laurels with a one-year return, as of March 31, of 11.39%. Mr. Morey\u2019s fund posted a one-year return of 10.85%. For the quarter, however, the two funds\u2019 positions were reversed, with Mr. Morey generating a return of 8.82%, beating Mr. Peris\u2019s 7.95%.\n\nSolid yields\n\nThe Federated fund generated a trailing 12-month yield of 2.94%, according to market-research firm Morningstar Inc., compared with the Integrity fund\u2019s 2.8%. That compares with the 2.04% average for the S&P 500 and the 2.56% average for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nDaniel Peris\u2019s fund was up 11.4% in a year, taking the crown. Photo: Scott Goldsmith\n\nEvery diversified U.S.-stock fund with at least $50 million in assets and a track record of more than three years is eligible for the quarterly Winners\u2019 Circle contest, as long as it is actively managed. Index funds and exchange-traded funds don\u2019t qualify, for that reason; leveraged funds also don\u2019t qualify. Hybrid funds that rely on combinations of fixed-income and equity-index products also don\u2019t make the cut.\n\nThe good old days\n\nMr. Peris is wistful when he looks back at the days when yields were much more substantial and companies managed their businesses to generate cash flow for their investors.\n\n\u201cOver history, that is how it was done. Otherwise, what people were doing was just trading and speculation,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the United States, markets departed from that norm in the 1980s and 1990s, and we are still suffering from the consequences\u201d in the form of exceptionally low yields. Any investor outside the U.S., he says, would recognize dividend-driven investing as standard investment theory. \u201cOnly in the U.S. is it a boutique approach,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Peris acquired many of his holdings in classic dividend plays like the tobacco stocks Philip Morris and Altria, telecommunications giants AT&T and Verizon, and utilities, such as Southern Co. and Duke Energy, during or before the financial crisis. \u201cComing out of the financial crisis, we found these bigger boats were able to handle the choppy seas more easily,\u201d he says.\n\nMichael Morey of Integrity Dividend Harvest Fund seeks companies that can boost dividends consistenly. Photo: Tina Lillemon/Integrity Viking Funds\n\nThese days, he tries to ensure that the average portfolio holding has a yield of 3%, but if a new position enters the portfolio, he wants it to have a yield well above that level\u2014at least 4%.\n\n\u201cWe will still hold on to positions as yields fall, though,\u201d he says. Given the choice between suffering a slide in the yield (as dividends come under pressure, not keeping up as stock prices climb) or letting the portfolio\u2019s quality suffer by chasing higher yields that can still be found but that require taking more risk, Mr. Peris says he\u2019ll opt to keep the portfolio\u2019s quality high.\n\nThat\u2019s why he has trimmed the fund\u2019s exposure to the energy sector roughly by half. \u201cWe owned some large, well-known companies a year ago that we don\u2019t own today,\u201d he says. (He declined to give any names.) But the fund does still hold shares of blue-chip integrated energy companies like Exxon Mobil.\n\nShared approach\n\nExxon Mobil is just one of the many companies the $11.8 billion Federated fund and the $57 million Integrity fund both own. Nor does Mr. Morey\u2019s investment approach differ too much from Mr. Peris\u2019s.\n\nMr. Morey seeks companies with robust cash flow and the ability to boost dividends consistently, regardless of what is happening to the stock market or the economy. Companies in the portfolio, he says, have increased dividends for an average of 30 years. The common element of his top holdings? \u201cThey are all companies that provide goods and services that people need or want on a daily basis,\u201d he says, from cellphone service and medication to cigarettes, fast food and soft drinks.\n\nBut in his quest for yield, Mr. Morey also will venture into territory that doesn\u2019t feature anywhere in Mr. Peris\u2019s list of top holdings. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to diversify out of consumer staples, which makes up such a large part of the dividend universe, and into sectors where we think the risk/return picture is improving substantially,\u201d he says.\n\nSo, while Mr. Peris has scaled back his allocation to energy, Mr. Morey has been looking for selective opportunities to buy stable businesses in that sector with high yields and good credit ratings. He also is willing to buy banks and other financial companies, which have taken a beating from the low-interest-rate environment, and has bought Wells Fargo. \u201cWe can\u2019t pinpoint when that turnaround will happen, but we are looking for investments, not trades,\u201d he says.\n\nMs. McGee is a writer in New England.

Bonds and cash still have a place. Illustration: Randall Enos for The Wall Street Journal\n\nLow-volatility stock funds have taken in gobs of money over the past year. The iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA fund (USMV), the biggest low-volatility exchange-traded fund, had about $8 billion in assets early this year. Now it has more than $13 billion, while other stock funds bleed assets.\n\nClearly, investors want stock exposure without the gyrations that normally come with it. And they think \u201clow-vol\u201d funds are how to get it.\n\nThat might be wishful thinking.\n\nA low-vol strategy, like other smart-beta strategies, tries to beat the stock market by picking stocks based on a factor that usually breaks the link between a stock\u2019s size and its position in a plain market index. In other words, the strategy underweights the most popular stocks.\n\nBut expecting a low-volatility stock portfolio to eliminate most of the painful turbulence that stocks deliver isn\u2019t realistic. If you want a serious cushion for volatility in your portfolio, you need some bonds.\n\n\u2018Low-vol\u2019 is still volatile\n\nThe low-volatility investment strategy owes its existence to Robert Haugen, a finance professor who died in 2013. Prof. Haugen spent his career arguing against the idea that more volatility was necessary to achieve greater reward.\n\nAccording to the theory, Tesla Motors may change the world with new technology and is fun to talk about at parties, but Procter & Gamble will put cash in your pocket more reliably by selling toothpaste and laundry detergent. And Prof. Haugen had backtests to prove it.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t think low-volatility stocks were substitutes for bonds. He thought the stock market was inefficient, and, like Benjamin Graham, the founder of value investing, surmised that he could beat it over time by avoiding the most volatile, glamorous stocks.\n\nLow-volatility stocks are still stocks, after all, and investors may be forgetting how volatile even boring stocks can be. USMV\u2019s top 25 holdings, representing 34% of its portfolio, fell on average by nearly 17% in 2008 during the financial crisis. That\u2019s better than the 37% swoon of the S&P 500, but still painful. Some of the fund\u2019s holdings like McDonald\u2019s were actually up during that awful year. But others, like UnitedHealth Group, dropped more than 50%.\n\nLow-volatility stocks also might be expensive now. The top 25 holdings of USMV have an average star rating of 2.7 from Morningstar.\n\nMorningstar rates stocks on a scale of one star, meaning a stock is expensive, through five, meaning a stock is cheap. A three-star stock means it currently trades at a price close to an analyst\u2019s fair-value estimate of its underlying business.\n\nSo an average rating of 2.7 stars means a group of stocks is a bit expensive. No firm\u2019s analysis is perfect, but certainly nothing in Morningstar\u2019s analysis indicates that low-volatility stocks are cheap.\n\nGet stability from bonds, cash\n\nThis means investors seeking to reduce a portfolio\u2019s volatility, as always, must consider cash and bonds.\n\nNo doubt, this is harder than it has been for much of history. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note is yielding less than 2% and might not allow its owner to keep up with inflation. Cash is yielding nothing, and, for now, is trailing inflation and reducing an investor\u2019s purchasing power.\n\nA quality portfolio of bonds of moderate-length maturity should still protect investors better than low-volatility stocks. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nNevertheless, part of a portfolio in low-returning but stable bonds is better than one fully invested in stocks that causes an investor to panic and sell after a market decline.\n\nInvestors should remember that core bond portfolios have produced standard deviations of returns of around 4% for the past quarter-century. That means their returns have mostly fallen in a range of 4% from their average return.\n\nBy contrast, according to a 2013 research paper from Newport Beach, Calif., asset manager Research Affiliates, U.S. low-volatility stocks had a standard deviation of around 11% for the 20-year period starting in 1993. That\u2019s lower than the 15% standard deviation that large-cap U.S. stocks produced, but it is still gut-wrenching compared with bonds.\n\nFor more perspective, investors should consider that low-volatility stocks have been even more volatile than junk bonds, according to the Research Affiliates paper.\n\nIt\u2019s true that investment-grade bonds may be more volatile in the future than they have been over the past 30 years or so. After all, interest rates have mostly done nothing but decline since the early 1980s, giving bonds the most favorable environment possible, since prices rise when rates fall and vice versa.\n\nBut a portfolio of bonds whose maturity is of moderate length and whose credit quality is high should still have far greater stability than a low-volatility stock portfolio.\n\nAnd low-volatility stock portfolios might not withstand a downturn as well as they have in the past given all the attention investors have lavished on them lately.\n\nMr. Coumarianos, a former Morningstar analyst, is a writer in Laguna Hills, Calif.

Similarly, funds on the left generally like shares with low price/earnings and price/book ratios; those to the right pursue higher such multiples\u2014shares of companies that often exhibit greater growth in earnings and book value.\n\nStyle boxes are so widely consulted, many fund managers strive to make sure their dot doesn\u2019t move from its current location on the grid.

My research shows that some funds with the best records over the past 15 years moved to a different part of the style box.\n\nA risk-adjusted test\n\nTo test my theory whether style drift could at times be a virtue instead of a sin, I looked at 106 large-cap stock and balanced funds with more than $1 billion in assets whose managers produced good 15-year risk-adjusted returns with an emphasis on downside protection. I then ranked these funds according to their Sortino ratio, a calculation that reflects an investment\u2019s return in relation to its volatility to the downside. The higher the ratio, the more return the fund was able to achieve compared with its downside volatility.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t surprising to see many balanced funds with higher Sortino ratios than pure stock funds\u2014an otherwise unusual occurrence for a 15-year period. That\u2019s because the S&P 500 index had a poor run for the 15 years ended in 2015. It produced a 5% annualized return versus a 5.6% annualized return for Vanguard Balanced Index Fund, which maintains 60% exposure to U.S. stocks and 40% exposure to U.S. bonds at all times.\n\nThe fund that landed at the top of the heap when ranking them by Sortino ratio was FPA Crescent (FPACX), a fund that usually has around 60% of its portfolio in stocks but varies the remainder widely among cash, junk bonds or even extra stock exposure, depending on which securities are offering the best risk-reward proposition in founding manager Steve Romick \u2019s view.\n\nFPA Crescent\u2019s Sortino ratio for the 2001-15 period was 1.15, more than double the 0.50 average reading for the 106 funds on the list. This tells you that it achieved significantly higher returns for the amount of downside volatility its shareholders had to endure.\n\nDon\u2019t be so style-driven\n\nExamining FPA Crescent further reveals that the fund has one of the most extreme \u201cstyle trails\u201d over time. In other words, mapping the fund\u2019s stockholdings for the 15-year period shows that its portfolio moved radically from small-cap stocks to large-cap stocks. It also moved from blend to value to growth.\n\nOver the 15-year period, the fund went from having its stock allocation almost exclusively in small-caps to having only 4% small-cap exposure. The average market capitalization of its stockholdings is now above $50 billion, according to Morningstar.\n\nA glance at two Russell indexes bears out the wisdom of FPA Crescent\u2019s move from small- to large-cap. From 2001 through 2010, the Russell Top 200, containing the largest 200 stocks, radically underperformed the Russell 2000 Index, containing the smallest 2000, 0.18% annualized compared with 6.33%.\n\nHowever, in the 2011 through 2015 period, the Russell Top 200 posted a 12.9% annualized return versus 9.2% for the Russell 2000. FPA Crescent and other flexible value funds proved prescient in thinking bargains existed among large-cap stocks around the end of the last decade.\n\nBecause of its willingness to hold cash when Mr. Romick finds most markets unappealing, FPA Crescent will lag behind major stock indexes for long stretches.\n\nBut for the 15-year period ended in 2015, the fund produced a 10.3% annualized return versus a 5.8% annualized return for the combined Russell Top 200 and Russell 2000 indexes. Style-box migration from small-cap stocks to large-cap stocks has contributed to that result.\n\nMr. Coumarianos, a former Morningstar analyst, is a writer in Laguna Hills, Calif.

And those efforts gained some momentum after an October ruling by the Labor Department cleared the way for managers of pension funds and 401(k) plans who had been concerned, based on a 2008 department advisory, that their fiduciary duty might not allow them to offer sustainable-investment options.\n\n8 Questions to Answer About Investing for Retirement Everyone hopes to enter retirement with enough money to pay the bills. The key is understanding how to save and invest long before you retire. VIEW Interactive\n\nFund providers have taken the initiative, rather than waiting for retirement-plan managers to seek out their offerings. \u201cI don\u2019t think the strategy of waiting for the market to come to you is the right one,\u201d says Scott Kilgallen, managing director at investment manager Neuberger Berman, a firm that includes what it calls a socially responsive investment fund among its many fund offerings.\n\nMr. Kilgallen says many companies are still surprised to hear his argument that sustainable investments don\u2019t necessarily sacrifice performance to achieve their social goals. The advisers who help plan sponsors formulate their retirement plans are a focus of fund providers\u2019 marketing efforts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of hand-to-hand with investors, advisers, consultants, big conferences,\u201d Mr. Kilgallen says. \u201cWe\u2019re always visible.\u201d\n\nHe says the effort of firms like his to get sustainable-investment funds into retirement plans has had its greatest success with managers of 403(b) accounts, the 401(k)-like vehicles for teachers and some nonprofits\u2014mission-driven institutions with an innate inclination to support social causes. The corporate market, he says, has been tougher to convince.\n\nOne factor behind that reluctance until recently was that there was little clarity on whether plans including sustainable-investment funds fulfilled companies\u2019 fiduciary responsibilities, under federal law, to protect employees\u2019 financial interests. Plan sponsors worried that sustainable investments were unproven financially and thus would expose employees to lower returns.\n\nLabor Department\u2019s blessing\n\nBut in October the Labor Department ruling, addressing plan fiduciaries\u2019 duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, said they \u201cdo not need to treat commercially reasonable investments as inherently suspect or in need of special scrutiny merely because they take into consideration environmental, social or other such factors.\u201d\n\nAnother challenge for the sustainable-fund industry is the explosive growth of target-date funds in recent years. Total net assets in target-date funds, which aren\u2019t in the sustainable-investment category, grew from $70.2 billion in 2005 to $763.4 billion last year. In the absence of sustainable target-date funds, the challenge will be to persuade people who have all of their retirement-plan money in target-date funds to shift some of it into sustainable investments.\n\nJoe Sinha, director of sales and marketing at Parnassus Investments, which runs the largest socially responsible mutual fund, Parnassus Core Equity (PRBLX), says he and his team lobby for his firm\u2019s offerings by meeting plan sponsors and sketching out scenarios that illustrate why sustainable investing is important. In one example he talks about two different companies with the same price/earnings ratio but different safety records. He then explains how a good safety record could affect future performance, including fewer lawsuits and more-successful recruiting efforts. Eventually, he says, plan sponsors come to understand the significance of social factors.\n\n\u201cI believe that there\u2019s been a shift in thinking\u201d among plan sponsors, he says. But many, he says, still haven\u2019t shaken the notion that a pure sustainable-investment play could compromise returns.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason he expects a shift in the market, with major fund providers offering sustainable-investment funds with a mix of holdings including some shares that might not meet some other providers\u2019 criteria for sustainable investment. For instance, such a fund might include the shares of a big oil company on the premise that the company is investing heavily in alternative fuels.\n\nA model menu\n\nProviders of sustainable-investment funds are hoping companies will follow the example of Qualcomm Inc. In 2011, the semiconductor company expanded its 401(k) offerings to include investments that focus on environmental factors, social concerns like labor practices, and religious or cultural beliefs.\n\n\u201cWe realized that there was employee interest to have investment options available connected to specific investing principles,\u201d a Qualcomm spokeswoman says. \u201cCurrently, employees can direct their retirement dollars to almost any stock, corporate or government bond, or mutual fund available on the open market.\u201d\n\nMr. Davidson is a writer in San Francisco.

Recent surveys show that investors still aren\u2019t adept at balancing their checkbooks. Only 57% of Americans passed a basic financial-literacy test, according to one recent global survey; in another survey, teens in the U.S. ranked between those of Russia and Latvia.

Prof. Willis, who works with the FoolProof Foundation, an educational organization that seeks to train investors in what she calls \u201cconsumer self-defense,\u201d argues that instead of conditioning consumers for a predatory market that they can\u2019t navigate on their own, the market itself should be restructured.\n\nPolicy makers have sought to give consumers more leverage, in addition to financial literacy. The creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau five years ago was such a step. In 2012, President Barack Obama began championing \u201cfinancial capability\u201d as opposed to literacy\u2014putting responsibility not only on consumers but on other players in the economic system. (In fact, the White House these days refers to April as National Financial Capability Month.)\n\nBut Financial Literacy Month has plenty of supporters. Bruce McClary, vice president of public relations at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, says the effort is still worthwhile, especially given recent economic weakness.

Richard Allen for The Wall Street Journal\n\nFor the first time in about seven years, investors approaching retirement may be facing one of their biggest financial fears: retiring into a bear market.\n\nBefore 2015, the stock market rose for six years in a row, despite many hiccups. Even last year, market averages set highs before sliding, and stocks are still in the red so far in 2016.\n\nNow, savers have to think about \u201csequence of returns\u201d risk: If they are forced to make withdrawals early in retirement from a portfolio that is declining precipitously, there will be fewer shares left over to benefit when the market eventually goes back up. That, in turn, raises the risk they could outlive their assets.\n\n8 Questions to Answer About Investing for Retirement Everyone hopes to enter retirement with enough money to pay the bills. The key is understanding how to save and invest long before you retire. VIEW Interactive\n\nObviously, the easiest thing to do is keep working, if you\u2019re willing and able to do it.\n\nBy delaying retirement, you can avoid withdrawing money when your portfolio is down and continue adding funds to your nest egg. \u201cThose contributions might be especially powerful if you\u2019re deploying money into stocks when they\u2019re falling,\u201d says Christine Benz, director of personal finance at mutual-fund researcher Morningstar Inc.\n\nMany people, however, don\u2019t want to\u2014or can\u2019t\u2014delay something they may have been anticipating for years. Here, then, are other moves retirees can take to mitigate bear-market risk.\n\n1. Tap a \u2018buffer\u2019 asset\n\nIdeally, retirement savers prepared in advance for sequence-of-returns risk by putting one to three years of income in cash. \u201cIf you\u2019re using that to spend from, that will keep you from having to invade your long-term assets when they\u2019re at a low ebb,\u201d says Ms. Benz.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have such a cash cushion, pulling money from an asset other than a retirement portfolio is an option\u2014assuming you have other assets, such as cash in a life-insurance policy or a home.\n\nIn recent research, Wade Pfau, a professor at American College and principal at McLean Asset Management, found that opening a reverse-mortgage line of credit\u2014despite the significant upfront loan costs\u2014can help protect retirees from sequence-of-returns risk. Reverse mortgages let homeowners who are 62 and older borrow against their home, with the loan due with interest when the borrower moves, sells or dies. These complicated loans, which require no monthly payments, have their fans and detractors.\n\nMr. Pfau\u2019s research suggests opening the credit line at the start of retirement, then letting it sit until needed. He describes the upfront loan costs as akin to an insurance premium.\n\nA home-equity line of credit is another option and has lower upfront costs, but retirees without a current income source may not qualify. Plus, with reverse mortgages backed by the federal government (known as Home Equity Conversion Mortgages), the unused portion of the credit line grows over time based on the loan\u2019s interest rate, and the lender can\u2019t change the amount. That usually isn\u2019t the case with home-equity lines of credit.\n\n2. Downsize\n\nDon\u2019t like the idea of a reverse mortgage but moving to a smaller home has always been part of your long-term retirement plan? Now may be the time to consider that option, if the home-sale proceeds would help you delay or reduce portfolio withdrawals.\n\n\u201cPeople may want to \u2018unlock\u2019 what is for many people their biggest asset\u2014their home,\u201d says Michael Falk, a partner with Focus Consulting Group Inc. in Long Grove, Ill.\n\n3. Cut costs\n\nTrim expenses to reduce portfolio withdrawals. \u201cGet in the frame of mind that when times are tough, \u2018I\u2019m pulling back a little,\u2019 \u201d says Tom Fredrickson, a Brooklyn-based financial planner with Garrett Investment Advisors LLC.\n\nPut another way: Adjust your withdrawal rate. The oft-cited \u201c4% rule\u201d\u2014in which you withdraw 4% from your portfolio the first year of retirement and increase that dollar amount each year for inflation\u2014assumes you generally increase spending each year. \u201cTaking less in weak markets and potentially taking more in up markets are strategies to help sustain a portfolio,\u201d Ms. Benz says.\n\nIt might be tempting to make an early grab for Social Security benefits as a lifeline when markets are in turmoil. Think carefully before doing that.\n\nYour benefits increase by about 8% annually each year you wait up until age 70, says Gordon Bernhardt, president of Bernhardt Wealth Management in McLean, Va. That higher dollar amount \u201ccould also benefit a surviving spouse if we assume the spouse with the higher income delays collecting his or her benefit and predeceases the other.\u201d\n\n4. Lock in income\n\nHow about exiting the stock market entirely\u2014and permanently?\n\nMr. Pfau describes a strategy of \u201cfunded ratio management,\u201d in which you look at your funded ratio\u2014all of your assets and income against your total spending needs through retirement. (This requires calculating the present value of both your future Social Security benefits and other income sources, as well as future liabilities.)\n\nIf a plummeting portfolio has you headed into the \u201cretirement at risk\u201d zone, \u201cit could be reasonable to bail, to lock in your income and avoid the risk that maybe the market will fall another 10%,\u201d he says.\n\nThere is no hard-and-fast rule about when to make that jump, Mr. Pfau says. \u201cIf you\u2019re at 135% funded, you\u2019re in pretty good shape. But if, with market declines, you start getting down to 110 or 105, you might want to think about locking in.\u201d\n\nOne option is to move the money you had in stocks into an annuity. \u201cYou give up future upside and you\u2019re also eliminating future downside,\u201d he says.\n\nYou may be selling low but it isn\u2019t because \u201cyou freaked out and panicked,\u201d Mr. Pfau says. \u201cIt\u2019s because you are realizing that, if you want to maintain your lifestyle, it\u2019s time to lock it in.\u201d\n\n5. Shop carefully\n\nStocks are on sale, right? Sure, but they might get even cheaper, warns Ms. Benz. \u201cThe energy sector is probably a great example. A lot more could go wrong before things get better.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re bargain hunting, she says, make sure \u201cyou have an appropriately long time horizon and that maybe you\u2019re offsetting those names you\u2019re buying with more defensive positions.\u201d\n\nIllustration: A. Richard Allen for The Wall Street Journal\n\nKeep diversification in mind, too, Ms. Benz says. Rather than making a big bet on one company or a single-sector fund, consider a value-oriented stock fund or exchange-traded fund for \u201cbroadly diversified exposure to unloved sectors,\u201d she says. And review your holdings before you start buying into deals. That energy ETF you\u2019re eyeing? The manager of your value-oriented stock fund might be focused on the energy sector, too, Ms. Benz says. \u201cCheck to see what your weighting there looks like.\u201d\n\nFinally, she says, \u201cdollar-cost averaging into positions can help ensure a range of purchase prices in case some of these unloved holdings fall further still.\u201d\n\n6. Don\u2019t panic\n\nThis is also known as: Stick with your investment plan. For investors with diversified portfolios, their losses \u201caren\u2019t nearly as big as the market,\u201d says Rick Kahler of Kahler Financial Group in Rapid City, S.D. \u201cThese dips are to be expected.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s never a good idea to manage investments based on headlines. You\u2019ve read the U.S. may be heading into a recession? Don\u2019t make portfolio changes based on that fear because you\u2019re too late, says Charlie Bilello, director of research at Pension Partners LLC in New York. \u201cBy the time they hear about the recession in the news, the markets are already pricing that in.\u201d\n\n7. Don\u2019t believe everything you hear\n\nThat said, just because everyone is saying something doesn\u2019t mean it is right for you. Take the idea that you shouldn\u2019t sell in a down market. Generally, that makes sense\u2014but selling might be the right decision for you, depending on your individual circumstances, Ms. Benz says.\n\nFor the first time in seven years, people getting ready to retire are doing so after a down year for the market. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re 64 and you have an 85% weighting in equities, maybe lightening up on equities is the right answer for you,\u201d she says.\n\nOf course, if you can tolerate the volatility financially and emotionally, waiting is usually more prudent, says Mr. Bernhardt. \u201cIf their portfolio needs to be adjusted to fit their risk profile, I\u2019m going to try to discourage them from making it during this market downturn,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s wait for a rebound.\u201d\n\n8. Consider a Roth conversion\n\nThere can be silver linings to a bear market. It might be a good time to shift assets from a traditional individual retirement account into a Roth IRA. Since Roths are funded with after-tax dollars, taxes will be due on the amount converted. However, the saver will be able to make tax-free withdrawals from the Roth after age 59\u00bd.\n\nPrevious Coverage How to Survive a Bear Market by E.S. Browning (March 8, 2015)\n\n\u201cThe idea is that there\u2019s a selloff and then over a period of time, it floats back up and you get the benefit of that account without having to pay taxes on the amount that it grew by,\u201d says Garrett\u2019s Mr. Fredrickson, who advises converting only assets you don\u2019t need immediately.\n\nStill, think carefully about the tax bill if you don\u2019t have any money set aside, warns Mr. Pfau.

She says investors and the industry will profit from more women following the trail she blazed.\n\nIndustry research shows just how far there is still to go. In last year\u2019s study on manager gender from fund researchers Morningstar, only 184 funds, or 2% of the roughly 7,700 in the sample, had solo female managers. A further 1,450 funds were managed by men and women. Overall, only 9% of fund managers were women.\n\nThis could be a case of what researchers at CFP Board, a trade group for financial advisers, recently called a \u201cfeminine famine.\u201d The other revelation in the Morningstar study: The average female manager produced returns in line with the average male, even though they were mostly managing niche funds that had higher-than-average expenses.\n\nMs. Hirsch, for her part, has beaten the S&P 500 for the past three, five and 10 years.\n\nA start at Drexel\n\nWhen Ms. Hirsch joined the brokerage Drexel Burnham & Co. as a secretary in 1975, she was attending Brooklyn College at night and expecting a child. To make sure she returned after her maternity leave, Ms. Hirsch\u2019s boss, in the research department, said he would promote her from secretary to an assistant analyst upon her return. She was soon one of only a handful of female analysts at the firm. With her lack of experience, she didn\u2019t get a coveted beat like chemicals or paper, but had to toil in a fringe sector known as \u201ccomputers and communications.\u201d\n\nWhile she says she never felt harassed or discriminated against, Ms. Hirsch often had the sense that \u201ceverybody\u2019s looking at you,\u201d simply because female analysts were unusual.\n\nTIAA\u2019s Susan Hirsch says in the 1970s on Wall Street, she often had the sense that \u2018everybody\u2019s looking at you,\u2019 because female analysts were unusual. Photo: Stephanie Diani\n\nWhen she went out on a limb to downgrade printer Moore Business Forms, the glare became even more intense. The idea that a big printing company could lose business to electronic competition was, to many investors of the day, like saying Hyperloop trains will put airports out of business. When The Wall Street Journal wrote about her downgrade and she began to get calls from irate shareholders, Ms. Hirsch says, she felt like hiding under the table.\n\nLater, Ms Hirsch worked as an analyst at Smith Barney, where she says male analysts still outnumbered women by about 10 to 1.\n\nAsked whether she felt she was taken seriously as a female analyst in those days, Ms. Hirsch goes back to an example from her time as an analyst at Lehman Brothers in the 1990s. An Ivy League graduate, an intern, worked as her assistant as she built a model for valuing growth stocks. \u201cA very young guy, very impressive. Inevitably, we would go into a room and people would ask him questions about \u2018his\u2019 model. But it wasn\u2019t his, it was mine!\u201d\n\nEvery sell-side (or brokerage) analyst hopes that their model will be adopted by someone on the buy side (such as a mutual fund). In Ms. Hirsch\u2019s case, that dream came true. Lehman Brothers liked her system of selecting growth stocks enough to give her a mutual fund to put it into practice, she says. And even when Lehman changed its strategy and decided to leave money management, the firm helped Ms. Hirsch keep her fund alive as an independent entity.\n\nRoad to TIAA\n\nRunning her own shop was no fun, however. Prudential Financial invited Ms. Hirsch to manage a midcap growth fund for them. After a decade there, she has spent a decade at TIAA Global Asset Management, founded to serve academics and others (and until recently known as TIAA-CREF).\n\nIn that time, the 63-year-old Ms. Hirsch says, she has seen marked growth in the number of women in supporting roles. It is no longer as unusual to see a female tech analyst as it was when she started at Drexel. She also cited the relatively large number of senior female money managers at TIAA as a sign that the money-management industry is slowly changing.\n\nEdited excerpts from a recent interview:\n\nWSJ: Does it surprise you that Morningstar\u2019s survey found such a low percentage of women money managers?\n\n\u2018I think men insist on the fact that they\u2019re right. That\u2019s the reason they don\u2019t ask for directions.\u2019 \u2014Susan Hirsch on the temperament of male and female fund managers\n\nMS. HIRSCH: It doesn\u2019t surprise me that you have only 2% of mutual funds managed by solo female managers. I think there are a lot more women I see in research as opposed to portfolio management, though I think that\u2019s beginning to change. I think research was the first area to accept women, because many came from good schools, and they were very detail-driven and focused. And great researchers. Excellent researchers.\n\nWSJ: Why do you think the number of female money managers has remained low, even as the percentage of women grows in other financial roles?\n\nMS. HIRSCH: They don\u2019t want you to become a portfolio manager and drive the returns unless you\u2019ve proven you\u2019ve done it before. So someone has to give you a chance. So what comes first? It becomes a little tricky.\n\nWSJ: What can a woman bring to a portfolio-management role that a man could not?\n\nMS. HIRSCH: Women do have a better temperament for money management because they have an instinct for the recognition that perhaps you\u2019re missing something. Women recognize that early on. I think men tend to insist on the fact that they\u2019re right. That\u2019s the reason they don\u2019t ask for directions\u2026because they\u2019re right. That way, you end up being not just a bit wrong, but very, very wrong. Women tend to pull back much more quickly, and [then tend to] think maybe this isn\u2019t the right approach.\n\nWSJ: A recent study that appeared in the journal Scientific Reports suggested that male hormones can drive reckless trading decisions. Does that jibe with your experience?\n\nMS. HIRSCH: When I was at Lehman, I remember working with one of the traders who would double down whenever a stock broke down. As a money manager and a female, if a stock is breaking down, it means there\u2019s something we missed. It\u2019s an indication of larger issues.\n\nWSJ: Is there any hope for significant growth in the number of female fund managers?\n\nMS. HIRSCH: There has to be an educational component that allows women to be more comfortable with these positions. I was lucky to have a research background\u2026. I\u2019d love to see that at school, financial research where logic is rewarded and investment sense is taught. I\u2019ve seen it happening selectively. My niece called me while she was in school [about 10 years ago]. There was a school stock-picking contest. She had chosen Taser as her stock choice.\n\nPrevious Coverage Where Are the Female Fund Managers? (July 2015)\n\nIt was one of these moonshots and she wanted to know: When do you sell it?\n\n\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d she asked.

Richard Allen for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe stock market most likely will rally at some point this summer. But that doesn\u2019t mean there will be a Summer Rally.\n\nThe distinction is important because, every year around Memorial Day and early June, many advisers start referring to a Summer Rally as something above and beyond the garden-variety rallies that occur at any time of the year. But there is no evidence that the stock market rallies more regularly or strongly during the summer months than it does in the spring, fall or winter.\n\nThe absence of a distinctive Summer Rally means that the rallies you can legitimately expect this summer are no more worth betting on than those that occur any other time. To put this another way: The stock market might rise powerfully between now and Labor Day, but if so its strength will have nothing to do with those three months being June, July and August.\n\nTo be sure, I have never found a precise definition of what the Summer Rally is supposed to entail. So it is always possible that a Summer Rally defined in some arcane way does in fact exist. But if we focus on any of the usual ways in which most investors picture a rally, this seasonal pattern turns out to be yet another urban myth.\n\nOverall lull\n\nThe first clue that a Summer Rally is fictional comes from the stock market\u2019s weak performance overall during the summer months. In fact, the months of June, July and August are one of the weakest three-month stretches of any in the calendar. Over the past 60 years, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has produced an average monthly return of just 0.1% during these three summer months, compared with a 0.7% average for all other months.\n\nLet\u2019s try a different approach: Even though the summer months as a whole are mediocre ones for equities, it\u2019s still possible that the stock market could stage an especially powerful rally along the way. To test for this possibility, I calculated the Dow\u2019s return over the years from its lowest close in June to its highest subsequent close through the end of August.\n\nOnce again, I failed to find anything special about the market\u2019s rally potential during the summer. Over the past six decades, the Dow gained an average of 6.9% from its lowest June close through its highest subsequent close over the next two calendar months. While you might think that is worth betting on, it in fact is nothing special: The comparable calculation for each of the other 11 months of the year shows that their rally potentials are stronger, averaging 8%.\n\nSummer of \u201932\n\nWhy, then, did investors ever come to think a Summer Rally really exists? There is no way of knowing for sure, of course. But one possibility is that it traces to the spectacular rally that occurred in the summer of 1932, at the depths of the Great Depression. The Dow gained 76.5% from its closing low in June of that year to its highest close in August. And if I extend my earlier historical analysis back far enough to include the decade of the 1930s, the Summer Rally\u2019s record does improve. But not by enough to convince a statistician that there is anything special about the stock market\u2019s potential during the summer months.\n\nThe stock market has had a weak performance overall during the summer months. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nIt is also possible that the origin of the Summer Rally is more cynically based in Wall Street\u2019s need to generate commission income. After all, the June-through-August period comes right in the middle of a six-month stretch that historically has been unfavorable for the stock market\u2014a pattern that explains the saying \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d In contrast to the Summer Rally, this \u201cSell in May\u201d pattern enjoys strong statistical support. The Summer Rally, then, could serve as a superficially plausible rationale for why investors should instead stay and not go away.\n\nLesson learned\n\nI suppose there is a roundabout way in which the Summer Rally can help us to become better investors: by teaching us the need to subject our hunches to rigorous scrutiny. The next time your broker or adviser refers to some pattern or another as a reason to make changes to your portfolio, ask him or her whether that pattern can be shown\u2014at standard levels of statistical significance\u2014to be more than just random noise.\n\nMost of what Wall Street talks about can\u2019t pass this test, which is one reason why so few beat the market over time.\n\nMr. Hulbert is editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest and a senior columnist for MarketWatch.

Here are some of the recent questions, as well as answers from experts:\n\nMy grandson is a joint tenant in stock that I own, with dividends reported under my taxpayer ID. I realize that when he applies to college he must report his assets, but if I do not tell him about the asset, is he under any obligation to report these stockholdings?\n\nYes. \u201cThe assets in the account are considered owned by each party, and failing to report assets when applying for financial aid could be considered unlawful and may jeopardize any aid that your student could benefit from,\u201d says Mikel Van Cleve, director of personal-finance advice at USAA. Check with your lawyer to see if there\u2019s a way your grandson can benefit from your stockholdings without disadvantaging his college financial-aid applications.\n\nDoes it make sense to manage a 529 for a child so that some funds will be left over for a potential grandchild, harnessing the power of compound interest?\n\n\u201cIt does make great sense to \u2018harness,\u2019 as you say, the power of compounding by starting early, especially if financial-aid eligibility is not critical,\u201d Mr. Van Cleve says.\n\nBut don\u2019t be too quick to pay for your child\u2019s college education with funds outside a 529 just so you can preserve the account for a future grandchild, says John Grayson, a vice president at U.S. Bancorp Investments. It\u2019s impossible to know what the family\u2019s situation will be once that hypothetical grandchild goes to college. \u201cThere could be tax-law changes, or the grandchild may not need the funds in the plan,\u201d Mr. Grayson says.\n\nThis strategy can be smart, nevertheless, because you\u2019re ensuring that the money must be spent on education, allowing you some control\u2014even if you are no longer living at the time. A caveat: Assuming the tax laws stay the same, your future grandchild will face financial-aid implications when he or she begins making qualified distributions from the 529.\n\nIf I use my IRA required minimum distribution to directly pay for my daughter\u2019s tuition, is there income tax due?\n\nYes. You\u2019ll have to pay income tax on the distribution, although exceptions may apply if you\u2019ve made after-tax contributions, says Mr. Van Cleve. If you take the money out and immediately pay it to the college, you are allowed to exceed the $14,000 annual gift-tax exemption for each beneficiary (in this case, your daughter). Using the distribution for educational purposes will get you an exemption from the 10% early-withdrawal penalty if you are below age 59\u00bd; if you are above that age, there is no 10% penalty in any event, Mr. Grayson says. You will want to check with a tax expert about your particular situation.\n\nAt what balance do you recommend stopping contributions to a 529 plan and switching to a different investment vehicle?\n\nRules limiting contributions to a 529 plan vary from state to state, but a ceiling of around $350,000 is average, Mr. Grayson says.\n\nFigure out your goal, Mr. Van Cleve says: \u201cThis includes understanding how much the beneficiary\u2019s educational cost will be, how much of it you would like to fund, and how much you will need to save based on the time frame you have and the level of risk you are willing to take.\u201d\n\nThe power of compound interest can come into play here as well: If you fund a 529 early in the student\u2019s life, that money will have time to grow tax-free, potentially allowing the account to exceed the limit you could have contributed.\n\nOur child received a full scholarship to college, so we withdrew the money we had saved in a 529 and put it in a regular investment fund in the child\u2019s name. It now has about $150,000, which we think is too much to give to a recent graduate who should be learning to live within his own means. How can we keep him from knowing about or getting his hands on this money until he\u2019s older?\n\nCongratulations on raising a scholarship winner. Unfortunately, if you have already transferred the money into your son\u2019s name, \u201cthe cat may already be out of the bag,\u201d Mr. Van Cleve says. Upon reaching the age of 18 or 21, depending on the state of residence, a custodial account for a minor terminates by law\u2014and the child is entitled to all the money.\n\nIf this happens again with a younger child, Mr. Van Cleve says, consider leaving the money in the 529 plan.\n\n\u201cThe IRS allows a dollar-for-dollar offset when scholarship funds are received, which allows you to avoid the tax penalty for nonqualified withdrawals,\u201d says Mr. Van Cleve.\n\nIf you do take out the money, don\u2019t make the same mistake by putting it in a custodial account.\n\n\u201cThe primary way to restrict access to assets would be to place the funds in a trust and specify in the trust language how to distribute the money,\u201d says Mr. Grayson. Moving the funds into a limited-liability corporation that you control and then giving the child a membership interest in the LLC may also work.\n\nRules limiting contributions to a 529 plan vary by state, but a ceiling of around $350,000 is average. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nCan I use a single 529 account for all three of my grandchildren?\n\nYou can, but you shouldn\u2019t. An account can only have one beneficiary, and you can change the beneficiary once a year.\n\n\u201cIf you want to use the funds for each grandchild while in college, one account would not work if they are in college at the same time,\u201d Mr. Grayson says. Another issue: You may want to make sure your contributions to the 529 do not exceed the annual gift limits, says Mr. Van Cleve: \u201cYou can contribute more by establishing a separate 529 plan for each grandchild, assuming no other gifts have been made,\u201d he says. Depending on the age spreads between your grandchildren, it may also make sense to invest the funds at a different time horizon.\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

Photo: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nMost investors in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds probably don\u2019t worry much about liquidity. After all, fund shares can be bought and sold easily anytime online, and trades are completed in one to three business days.\n\nBut there is another layer of trading\u2014the trading the funds themselves do when a wave of selling by investors requires the funds to sell some of their assets\u2014that has the Securities and Exchange Commission worried about liquidity. And the commission wants investors to be more aware of the risks it sees.\n\nThe issue is particularly pertinent for the fixed-income fund market, because assets that some of those funds hold are very thinly traded. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s involved.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s concern is that some mutual funds and ETFs might hold too many securities that aren\u2019t easy to sell quickly. As a result, the funds might not always be able to adjust their holdings without \u201cmaterially affecting\u201d the funds\u2019 net asset value per share, the commission said in its September announcement of proposed new liquidity-risk management rules. In other words, selling a substantial amount of illiquid securities quickly could drive down their price, resulting in a big loss for a fund, lowering its value.\n\nThe 15% solution?\n\nAmong other things, the proposed rules would require funds to categorize the liquidity risk of their holdings according to how many days it would take to sell the assets without greatly affecting their market price, and disclose those risk assessments to investors. The SEC also proposed to strengthen and clarify an existing guideline that no more than 15% of a fund\u2019s assets should be held in securities that would take more than seven days to convert to cash.\n\nSeveral ETF issuers, as well as the Investment Company Institute, a fund industry trade group, have said in comment letters that the SEC\u2019s proposals aren\u2019t relevant to most ETFs, because the funds are structured differently from mutual funds.\n\nMutual-fund investors buy and sell their shares directly from or to the fund. So mutual funds regularly need to sell assets on the open market to pay investors who are redeeming their shares. But ETF shares are traded among investors, not between investors and the fund. So most ETFs usually don\u2019t have to sell assets when investors sell their shares, because the shares are being bought by other investors, not being redeemed by the fund.\n\nETF shares are only created or redeemed, and the underlying assets bought or sold, when doing so is necessary to keep the market price in line with the net asset value of the fund\u2019s holdings. Those transactions are done between the funds and financial institutions called authorized participants, or APs, which often also serve as market makers in the ETFs and other securities.\n\nHere is how it works in most cases: If heavy selling is driving an ETF\u2019s market price below the fund\u2019s net asset value, a market maker, acting through an AP or acting as an AP itself, will buy up shares and deliver them to the fund in the form of a so-called creation unit\u2014taking them off the market\u2014in return for an equal value of the underlying assets held by the fund. It\u2019s then up to the trading firm to decide if it wants to hold those assets or sell them.\n\nThe argument ETF issuers are making to the SEC is essentially that this process insulates ETF investors from the dangers of a fund having to sell illiquid securities on the open market.\n\nStill worried\n\nThe opposing argument, made by the SEC and those who favor the proposed new rules, is that there is a risk that the AP might not be willing to take on assets that are very hard to sell quickly, throwing a wrench into the whole process of keeping the fund\u2019s net asset value in line with its share price. That would be reflected in a widening of the bid-ask spread for the ETF\u2014the difference between the price investors can get for selling shares and the higher price they would have to pay to buy the shares.\n\nThe concern that this could happen to a fixed-income ETF is based in part on changes in recent years in the fixed-income markets. Financial institutions in general are more averse to the liquidity risk that some debt securities pose, in part because of increased regulation governing the institutions\u2019 risk exposure. Investment banks, for instance, hold 80% less corporate bond inventory than a decade ago.\n\nUltimately, according to many traders and market participants, concerns around ETFs and fixed-income holdings will only be mitigated when there is more transparency in the market, as more securities are quoted and traded electronically. Currently, only about 10% to 25% of the secondary trading in corporate bonds\u2014depending on the amount of each bond in the market and the issuer\u2019s credit quality\u2014is electronic. The rest is done via online messaging and phone calls.\n\nThe accompanying graphic explores the facts and figures of bond liquidity and ETFs.\n\nMr. Weinberg is a writer in Connecticut.

But new research suggests that having too many choices in a 401(k) retirement plan could be costly for participants.\n\nResearchers studied a 401(k)-type plan that reduced the number of mutual funds it offered by close to half. They found that investors who were forced to shift their money out of the funds being eliminated from the plan tended to move into funds with lower fees\u2014even though the funds available after the plan was streamlined had almost exactly the same range of fees as the menu of funds before the choices were reduced.\n\nThe estimated savings averaged more than $9,400 over a 20-year period for each participant who had to change investments, or $470 a year, says a report published last month by the National Bureau of Economic Research. (NBER is the organization known for tracking economic cycles, including declaring recessions.)\n\nThe researchers didn\u2019t have any information on why plan participants chose the funds they did. But they offered one possible explanation for the movement into lower-cost funds: \u201cToo many choices may create confusion, resulting in poorly informed consumer decisions,\u201d says the report, written by Donald B. Keim and Olivia S. Mitchell, both professors at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe professors also found a difference in investors\u2019 risk levels after the number of choices was reduced\u2014even though, as with fees, the risk levels available before and after the streamlining were nearly identical. \u201cAfter the reform, streamlined participants held significantly less equity and exhibited significantly lower risks\u201d than previously, according to the paper.\n\nDozens of funds cut\n\nThe researchers studied a large nonprofit organization in the U.S. that had almost 90 choices in its retirement plan, including sector funds holding assets such as real-estate investment trusts and commodities, as well as broader stock and bond funds and target-date funds.\n\nWharton\u2019s Donald B. Keim, shown, and Olivia S. Mitchell say too many choices may create confusion. Photo: University of Pennsylvania\n\nIn 2011, the nonprofit, which isn\u2019t named, decided to eliminate 39 investment choices. The participants who were in the funds to be eliminated could move their money into any of the other funds or opt for a brokerage account that gave them access to the eliminated funds plus more alternatives\u2014an option that few investors chose. Those who didn\u2019t make either of those choices would have their money moved to an age-appropriate target-date fund.\n\nThe decision on which funds to eliminate was based on a variety of factors including annual expenses, as well as how many participants and dollars were in each fund. The surviving funds included similar asset classes to those that were cut. Before the change, \u201cthere may have been six or seven choices in the same asset class, so there was a lot of redundancy of choice,\u201d says Dr. Keim.\n\nThe new funds chosen by participants who moved their money had lower turnover rates overall than the funds those participants moved out of, meaning the fund managers made fewer trades, which translates to lower transaction costs and lower fees for investors.\n\nA guiding hand\n\nThe question of whether retirement plans should give participants as much choice as possible or take a more paternalistic approach by limiting choices has long been an issue.\n\nCould fewer choices save you $470 a year?

The poor start came after the index\u2019s six-year winning streak ended in 2015. What\u2019s more, stocks may not have seen the lows for this correction yet, money managers caution.\n\nBut big market moves present opportunities, and there are things that investors might do\u2014or avoid doing\u2014to enhance future returns, professionals say. With valuations now lower, it might make sense to add to current stock positions or diversify to trim overall risk in a portfolio, they say.\n\nStill, investors should think in terms of tuning up, not tearing up, portfolios, says Daniel Culloton, associate director of fund analysis at Morningstar Inc. Because events that drive trading can be transitory, most people are better off \u201csetting a long-term plan, evolving it and then sticking with it,\u201d he says.\n\nHere is a closer look at seven domestic and global events affecting stocks\u2014including oil, China and the U.S. election\u2014and how investors might want to play them, now that the overall market isn\u2019t shrugging off every challenge.\n\n1. The slide in oil\n\nCrude oil\u2019s plunge has fanned fears of global recession, a financial squeeze for oil-producing countries and bond defaults by some debt-laden U.S. producing companies.\n\nWith energy stocks sharply lower, is now the time to step in? It is impossible to gauge whether those stocks are attractively valued without knowing where oil is headed from here, says Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment manager at Eaton Vance Investment Management, Boston. If investors want to venture in, a sensible strategy might be \u201cdollar-cost averaging,\u201d or making modest purchases at regular intervals regardless of where prices stand, he says. That would lower the risk of mistiming purchases.\n\nBut don\u2019t rush to buy, adds New York-based adviser Richard Bernstein, former chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch & Co. Typically, he says, as any market nears a cyclical bottom, the last move along the way can be steep. Individual investors often do better by being late to the party rather than early, he adds.\n\n2. China\u2019s slowing growth\n\nAlthough it is the world\u2019s second-largest economy, behind the U.S., China\u2019s direct impact on U.S. stocks is modest: S&P 500 companies probably get less than 8% of revenue from all of Asia, estimates S&P Capital IQ and SNL, a division of McGraw Hill Financial.\n\nStill, because China news can drive big moves in markets, it is difficult to find stocks that are totally unaffected, says Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer for equities at Charles Schwab Investment Management. But the fundamental impact might be less for small-cap or midcap stocks with a domestic focus than for big, multinational companies with a presence in Asia, Mr. Aguilar says.\n\nBlackRock Inc. \u2019s iShares unit, Vanguard Group and State Street Global Advisors all offer ETFs that trade the Russell 2000, a benchmark for small-cap stocks.\n\nFor investors who want a professional manager, some active funds have a strong domestic focus. Diamond Hill Small-Mid Cap (DHMIX), which holds Morningstar\u2019s top gold rating, owns stocks such as Jarden Corp. (JAH), a maker of outdoor equipment and kitchen appliances, and medical-device maker Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX).\n\n3. The corporate-profits recession\n\nWith markets so fixated on oil and China, it is unclear whether corporate profit reports are having as much impact as usual, says Sam Stovall, U.S. equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ and SNL. But if investors are paying attention, they have likely noticed that the news has been dismal.\n\nProfits for the fourth quarter of 2015, now being reported, could be off as much as 6% on average from a year ago, led by an expected 60% drop in the energy sector, Mr. Stovall says. Besides the energy price collapse, a major headwind is the strong dollar, which has made U.S. goods less competitive in overseas markets.\n\nBut investors shouldn\u2019t bail out of stocks merely because of worries about the latest quarterly profits, Mr. Stovall says. One reason, he says, is energy stocks are the prime reason for the broad decline. If oil prices level off later this year, comparisons would look much better. Fourth-quarter 2016 profits actually could post a double-digit rise, he adds.\n\n4. Volatility and shifting sentiment\n\nIt can be scary to own stocks when markets are gyrating. Fear often prompts people to make decisions that haunt them later, professionals say. Generally, people who can\u2019t commit to a position in stocks for, say, five years shouldn\u2019t own them, says William Barker, a fund manager at Motley Fool Funds.\n\nInvestors who want a more conservative strategy could consider shares in big blue chips, particularly those that pay regular dividends, have dominant positions in their markets and strong balance sheets. Those tend to be less volatile.\n\nA fund that focuses on large-cap companies with a record of strong financial performance is Jensen Quality Growth (JENRX), which gets Morningstar\u2019s silver rating, the second highest. Morningstar\u2019s Mr. Culloton also cites Vanguard Dividend Growth fund (VDIGX), which focuses on large-cap companies that consistently pay or raise dividends, such as Coca-Cola Co. and McDonald\u2019s Corp. It holds Morningstar\u2019s gold rating.\n\nAnother such fund is Royce Special Equity (RYSEX), a small-cap fund. Mr. Culloton says its manager, Charles Dreifus, is a \u201cvery meticulous stock picker with very high standards who delves into the accounting of all the companies he wants to own and will avoid sectors he thinks he can\u2019t understand well.\u201d The fund holds a gold Morningstar rating.\n\n5. Long-term macroeconomic trends\n\nBesides reacting to daily news, stocks also are being buffeted by long-term trends, says Jack Rivkin, chief executive of Altegris Investments Inc. in La Jolla, Calif., and former head of world-wide equities at Lehman Brothers. Among those trends, he says, is the continuing transition to a services-focused economy in the U.S. While declining to name stocks, Mr. Rivkin says investors should look for growth in service areas such as restaurant and hotel chains, cloud-computing concerns, professional-services firms and financial companies, among others.\n\nMr. Bernstein, the New York-based adviser, points to the consumer sector as another area of strength in the U.S. economy. Two popular ETFs that invest in less-volatile securities recently held about a fourth of their portfolios in the consumer sector: PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) and iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility (USMV).\n\n6. The U.S. election\n\nInvestors hate uncertainty, notes Mr. Stovall of S&P Capital IQ. And because uncertainty rises whenever the nation is preparing to elect a new leader, stocks often have a negative year.\n\nSince World War II, the decline has averaged minus 1.4% in the eighth year of presidential terms, Mr. Stovall calculates.\n\nBut investors who stand pat can get rewarded. In the first year of each new presidential term, stocks have posted average gains of 6.2%. The rise is even stronger in the first year of a president\u2019s second term, averaging nearly 10%.\n\nWill those trends hold this year and next? Market strategists say it is too early to tell, because the field of candidates remains crowded and poll results have been shifting significantly.\n\n7. The Fed and interest rates\n\nOver the past three years, hints that the Federal Reserve was considering its first rate increase since the 2008-09 financial crisis sometimes rattled markets. But after policy makers finally nudged short-term rates up by a modest 0.25 percentage point in December, it currently looks as though the Fed is unlikely to make more than one rate increase in 2016, says Rick Rieder, a top fixed-income strategist and bond-fund manager at BlackRock.\n\nConcerns about further tightening have mostly dissipated because of an apparent slowing in U.S. growth and other events that have caused stocks to drop sharply, says Mr. Rieder.\n\nIf the Fed does raise rates slowly from here, it would be bullish for stocks, equity strategists say, because it might limit further gains in the dollar, helping U.S. exports. If the dollar were to level off, that would aid sectors that have been under pressure, such as manufacturing, says Eaton Vance\u2019s Mr. Perkin. Conversely, if the dollar were to head higher, he says, that would further pressure oil prices and weaken appetites for stocks.\n\nMr. Pollock is a writer in Ridgewood, N.J.

But those who fall short on financial planning can pay a big price.\n\nFor the 380,000 retirees who live abroad, according to the Social Security Administration\u2014up from 307,000 in 2008\u2014the potential missteps are numerous. Amid a U.S. crackdown on money laundering, tax evasion and non-compliance with tax-reporting obligations, some expats are being cut off by their banks and brokerage firms. Others are running afoul of the Internal Revenue Service. Many are discovering that tax treaties don\u2019t always fully protect them from double taxation.\n\n\u201cPeople rarely understand the complexity of cross-border moves,\u201d says Jonathan Lachowitz, founder of White Lighthouse Investment Management of Lexington, Mass., and Lausanne, Switzerland. \u201cYou have to give planning a lot of time.\u201d\n\nWhat follows are six common financial mistakes people make when retiring abroad, and how to avoid them.\n\n1. Closing U.S. accounts\n\nTo pay rent and utility bills, you\u2019ll need to open a bank account in the country you are relocating to. But don\u2019t close your U.S. accounts.\n\nExperts say expats generally should keep the bulk of their wealth in the U.S. That way, they can continue to take advantage of U.S. retirement accounts, such as traditional and Roth 401(k) and individual retirement accounts.\n\n\u201cMost foreign institutions cannot hold 401(k)s and IRAs and these accounts don\u2019t often have equivalents in other countries that the IRS gives tax-preferred status to,\u201d says Mr. Lachowitz.\n\nBy keeping most of your money in the U.S., you will also minimize the foreign assets you must report annually to the IRS\u2014an obligation that can trigger stiff penalties if you miss filing deadlines or underreport assets.\n\nIt is easy to make periodic transfers from U.S. retirement and bank accounts to a foreign bank account. Expats who use U.S. brokerage firms and banks also potentially save on fees and preserve conveniences.\n\nFor example, U.S. banks typically charge no fees for services including depositing and cashing checks\u2014something that isn\u2019t always true of their foreign rivals, Mr. Lachowitz says. But rates for services like currency conversions differ significantly, so ask around to identify the most competitive banks in your new home.\n\n2. Failing to investigate firms\u2019 policies\n\nDue in part to concerns about U.S. crackdowns on money laundering and tax evasion, some U.S. banks and brokerage firms are dropping customers with foreign addresses, says Roland Sabates, director of operations of H&R Block\u2019s U.S. expat tax services.\n\nAt least six months before packing your bags, call the firms with which you do business to ask about their policies. \u201cEach firm is different and some of them are more or less comfortable depending on which foreign country\u201d you move to, says Mr. Lachowitz.\n\nIf a firm warns that it doesn\u2019t accept expats as customers, be sure to move your money before you leave the U.S. While many companies (including Vanguard Group and T. Rowe Price Group) generally let expats keep existing accounts, some (Vanguard and T. Rowe Price included) won\u2019t permit them to open new accounts with an overseas address. (Charles Schwab & Co.\u2019s policies vary by country.)\n\nBecause corporate policies change, Mr. Lachowitz suggests having two U.S. bank, brokerage and credit-card accounts. \u201cHave a backup in case one institution decides not to work with you,\u201d he says.\n\nBe aware, too, that most financial firms in the U.S. won\u2019t provide investment advice to residents of foreign countries. Nor will they generally let expats buy new shares in U.S.-listed mutual funds. Instead, plan to buy individual stocks and bonds or exchange-traded funds.\n\nSteer clear of non-U.S. mutual funds, which \u201cfor U.S. tax purposes are treated very punitively,\u201d says David Kuenzi, founder of Thun Financial Advisors in Madison, Wis.\n\n3. Failing to shop for the best deals\n\nWhen shopping for a bank in your new country, compare fees on services like wire transfers and exchange rates. Because credit cards \u201coften offer better exchange rates than banks,\u201d it can make sense to favor plastic over cash, says Mr. Kuenzi, who recommends cards that don\u2019t levy foreign transaction fees. Such fees typically amount to about 2% of a transaction\u2019s value. Companies including Capital One and American Express have no-fee offerings.\n\n4. Failing to file U.S. income tax returns\n\nIf you are a U.S. citizen, your income is subject to U.S. income tax regardless of how much you make or where you live. If you don\u2019t file a U.S. tax return, you could face penalties and interest, and even criminal prosecution.\n\nTo owe no state income tax, you must \u201cbreak your domicile,\u201d says Mr. Kuenzi. In many states, that simply means selling your residence. But some states consider rental properties, storage facilities, driver\u2019s licenses and voter registrations as evidence of ongoing ties and a basis for taxation.\n\n5. Failing to budget for double taxation\n\nIf you move to one of more than 65 countries with which the U.S. has income-tax treaties, you may think you will pay tax to only one country. But that isn\u2019t always the case.\n\nSometimes, the treaties agree on definitions of residency, acknowledge one government\u2019s right of first taxation, or coordinate taxes on pensions, including Social Security, says Mr. Kuenzi.\n\nStill, they don\u2019t always protect expats from paying tax to both countries. Indeed, often the IRS expects to be paid on top of what is owed to the host country.\n\nConsider a retired American couple who moves abroad and sells $150,000 worth of stock. If the couple purchased the stock for $50,000, they will owe a capital-gains tax on their $100,000 profit. Assuming their new home country has a 10% capital-gains tax rate and calculates the tax on the stock purchase price, the couple will pay $10,000 to that government.\n\nPhoto: Shaiith/Getty Images\n\nAs a result, the couple typically can claim a $10,000 tax credit on their U.S. return. But that won\u2019t fully offset the capital-gains tax they will owe the U.S., which has a maximum long-term capital gains tax rate of 20%. As a result, the couple must pay Uncle Sam up to an additional 10%, or $10,000.\n\nUnanticipated taxes can also arise if the tax systems in the two countries differ. Consider Switzerland, which\u2014unlike the U.S.\u2014has no capital-gains tax on securities but levies a wealth tax, which is a tax on the total value of one\u2019s assets. An American who moves to Zurich could wind up paying both taxes in full\u2014a capital-gains tax to the U.S. and a wealth tax to Switzerland\u2014without any offsetting tax credits.\n\n\u201cA tax credit can only be claimed if you pay the same kind of tax in both countries,\u201d says Mr. Kuenzi, who adds that some tax treaties specify which taxes correspond.\n\nRetirees who move to a country that doesn\u2019t have an income-tax treaty with the U.S. can generally claim tax credits for foreign taxes paid\u2014but only when \u201cthere is a corresponding U.S. tax due,\u201d says Mr. Kuenzi.\n\n6. Failing to file tax disclosures\n\nIn addition to filing U.S. tax returns, most expats have to submit a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, or FBAR, to the Treasury Department. This is required if the cumulative balance in your foreign financial accounts exceeds $10,000 at any time during the year. The penalties for failing to do so can be the greater of $100,000 or half of the account value for every year you failed to file.\n\nIndividuals with more than $200,000 and couples with more than $400,000 in foreign financial assets on the last day of the year\u2014or with more than a respective $300,000 or $600,000 any time during the year\u2014must also file IRS Form 8938, a Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets.\n\nStarting in 2016, foreign financial institutions must disclose U.S. customer account values to the IRS. This will allow the IRS to verify taxpayer disclosures, says Mr. Kuenzi.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nA photo caption in an earlier version on this story suggested the picture was of Switzerland.

It isn\u2019t unusual, for instance, for an organization to spend thousands of dollars in staff time and logistics to secure a large donation, including on things like site visits, facilities tours and meetings with a charity\u2019s executive director, says Jacob Harold, chief executive of GuideStar, which publishes data on charitable institutions.\n\n\u201cIn a big organization, they likely have an entire development team handling details, so it is an efficient use of an executive director\u2019s time to meet with large donors,\u201d says Mr. Harold. \u201cBut in a four-person nonprofit, the time it takes to arrange meetings and give tours and site visits is proportionately more of a burden.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say donors shouldn\u2019t do their homework before making a big gift, says Mr. Harold, but if they are targeting smaller organizations they should try to do it as efficiently as possible.\n\nDonors also should give plenty of consideration to where a nonprofit organization is in its life-cycle. Big gifts are likely to give donors more of a voice in newer, smaller charities as opposed to more established nonprofits that already have workable systems and plans in place.\n\nWhen an organization is in \u201cstartup mode,\u201d it requires all hands on deck and a level of engagement that involves pretty much everything, versus a more established organization that can use or leverage its board members or donors more tactically, says Andrew Hauptman, chairman of private investment firm Andell Inc. and co-founder and chair emeritus of the Los Angeles site of education nonprofit City Year.\n\nHaving a \u201cclear and frank\u201d discussion about both the donor\u2019s and nonprofit\u2019s goals helps set expectations and avoid misunderstandings, says Neil Kawashima, a Chicago-based partner at law firm McDermott Will & Emery LLP who focuses a significant part of his practice on philanthropic matters.\n\n\u201cA lot of times, there\u2019s a disconnect between what a donor wants and expects, and what the charitable organization wants or expects,\u201d he says.\n\nPutting those goals in writing, in the form of a legal gift agreement, is one way that donors can make sure their expectations are in line with those of the charity. The agreement or discussions also could iron out how much more, if anything, a donor is willing to give the organization and under what circumstances. That makes it easier for the charity to plan and the donor to avoid the awkwardness of having to turn down future requests.\n\nExit plan\n\nTo be sure, some experts caution against focusing too much on the business arrangement, especially with smaller nonprofits. But \u201cif you\u2019re talking about an eight-figure grant, it\u2019s understandable why there would need to be a legal contract,\u201d says GuideStar\u2019s Mr. Harold.\n\nAnother point for large donors to consider is whether to make their gift anonymous.\n\nMiss Manners may say it isn\u2019t polite to brag, but some philanthropic experts say putting a name to a large donation can help encourage more giving from a community.\n\n\u201cThere are benefits in terms of creating awareness and perhaps inspiring others to give,\u201d says Loren Brown, president and chief executive of the Catholic Foundation in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nIt can also get tricky when it\u2019s time for a large donor to end a gift, whether because of changing financial circumstances, a shift in personal views or even something as simple as moving away from the community served by the charity.\n\nAs with outlining expectations, planning for an exit from the get-go can go a long way in avoiding future conflict, experts say.\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\n\u201cFor more experienced nonprofits, a donor or foundation exit is an expected and normal part of philanthropy,\u201d says Jill Rademacher, chief donor experience and engagement officer at Silicon Valley Community Foundation, a Mountain View, Calif.-based organization that manages charitable funds and provides guidance to philanthropists.\n\nHowever, a multiyear grant can help smooth out the process, by setting expectations and informing the charity early on in the process that the donor won\u2019t be there forever. \u201cThat is the greatest respect you can show to an organization,\u201d she says.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nTotal contributions from individuals, foundations, bequests and corporations to various causes totaled more than $350 billion in 2014, according to Giving USA. An earlier version of the Where the Money Went chart in this article incorrectly stated that the total was for individuals.

Photo: Society of Grownups\n\nScarred by the Great Recession and laden with student debt, few millennials are in the mood, or in a position, to seek out a traditional financial adviser. But they need financial advice just the same.\n\nHence the arrival of new and unconventional approaches that try to help 20- and 30-somethings start saving and investing. These range from largely free or inexpensive services offered by financial-services providers\u2014including those the hipsters have tended to shun\u2014to podcasts and blog posts hosted and written by financially savvy young people working hard to win over a generation of skeptics.\n\nThere are new and unconventional approaches that try to help 20- and 30-somethings start saving and investing. MarketWatch's Jillian Berman discusses financial options for millennials. Photo: Getty\n\nTwentysomethings are \u201cstill going somewhere for the information,\u201d says Stefanie O\u2019Connell, 29, whose blog posts about personal finance from her perspective as a young actress getting by in New York led her to a book-publishing deal earlier this year. Ms. O\u2019Connell has blogged for Northwestern Mutual, Barclaycard and hosted a \u201cMillennials & Money Trivia Night\u201d for Capital One.\n\nNorthwestern Mutual has a personal-finance site, the Mint Grad, geared toward college students and recent college graduates. The site features young-adult bloggers who have experience managing their student loans or climbing out of credit-card debt. They come across as more authentic and less preachy than older advisers, says Emily Holbrook, director of the young personal market at Northwestern Mutual.\n\nSeeking credibility\n\n\u201cThat peer-to-peer contact, and content, is really important,\u201d says Ms. Holbrook. \u201cIt really gives a ton of credibility.\u201d Such posts can help get young adults in Northwestern Mutual\u2019s door, she says, and potentially drum up clients for life insurance, a core product, by focusing on how it can benefit them today instead of just 50 years down the line.\n\nMassMutual Financial Group has created a social club of sorts it calls Society of Grownups, which has its own physical space in the Boston area with light-wood furniture and an open-air feel that\u2019s more like a friend\u2019s loft than a bank. Twenty- and 30-somethings can choose from a variety of classes and programs offered at the site. These include dinners at which financial planners lead discussions on topics like similarities between a fine wine and a good investment, networking events and one-on-one meetings with certified financial planners.\n\nThe company uses a combination of word-of-mouth, social media and advertising, including on local subways, to draw young people in. Typically, classes draw at least six students and are capped at 12. Classes that cover less-complicated subjects, tips about travel, for instance, cost about $10. On average, six to eight events are hosted each week, with prices that vary depending on the level of information. Networking events, which tend to draw 20 to 30 people, are typically free. Events that include in-depth advice from a financial planner, as well as food and wine, cost about $40.\n\nKaren Carr, a 27-year-old certified financial planner with Society of Grownups, hosts some of the larger events and meets with clients who sign up for individual sessions. The question she hears most: \u201cAm I going to be paying student loans until the day I die?\u2019 \u201d One-on-one sessions cost $20 for 20 minutes and $100 for 90 minutes. Planners aren\u2019t allowed to sell products, says Nondini Naqui, CEO of Society of Grownups.\n\nDifferent goals\n\nSome of the millennials Ms. Carr helps are saving money, she says, but tend to have goals that are somewhat immediate and lifestyle-oriented, such as finding the money to travel. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about your accumulation of wealth,\u201d she adds.\n\nThe ability to weave financial advice into issues young people commonly face is part of what gives Erin Lowry\u2019s blog, Broke Millennial, its currency. Her blog has been featured by CBS Sunday Morning, USA Today, Yahoo!, Reuters and others.\n\nRelationships and emotions are frequent fare. She framed one of her posts as a love letter from the stock market to millennials to convince them to take a little risk, she says. Another, titled, \u201cGetting financially naked with your partner,\u201d focused on how she and her boyfriend broached the subject of his student debt, with an eye toward how that debt could effect their plans as a couple.\n\n\u201cI like to trick people into learning about money,\u201d says Ms. Lowry, who has a second job writing and editing blog posts for Magnify Money, a financial-comparison site. She also has written posts for credit-reporting company Experian and tax-preparer H&R Block.\n\nFarnoosh Torabi, 35, host of the \u201cSo Money\u201d podcast series, keeps her personal-finance message free of nitty-gritty investment strategies. Instead, she interviews experts and celebrities, like fashion personality Tim Gunn, about how they approach financial health. She says millennials appreciate advice that\u2019s more than just quick tips or calculations they could look up on Google. Aspirational 20- and 30-somethings are looking for ways to sort through their emotions surrounding money, Ms. Torabi says. Hearing candid stories from guests about how they worked through some of their biggest money problems helps empower her listeners to make their own money decisions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really about the numbers on the show, it\u2019s about the behaviors,\u201d says Ms. Torabi. Her podcast, launched in January, is on track to surpass 1.5 million downloads by the end of the year.\n\nHelpful apps\n\nAmong apps offering financial advice, Stash-it is about saving money, and geared toward young women. Users set saving goals and deadlines, then the app calculates how much they need to save each week to reach those milestones. The app peppers its users with tips like limiting ATM withdrawals to once a week to practice budgeting.\n\nThe app\u2019s creator, 35-year-old Helen Bui, says she received her own wake-up call about money as a 20-something working in New York City when, despite her drive and full-time employment, she found herself living paycheck to paycheck. She realized that things like multiple sushi dinners each week were luxuries she couldn\u2019t afford and that she had to make trade-offs. She says that Stash-it was launched in the Apple Inc. app store on Oct. 20 and that so far downloads are growing by 50% per week.\n\nDigit, a robo-savings tool, also nudges users, who are 27 on average, to think more about saving. The company\u2019s 30-year-old CEO, Ethan Bloch, says the inspiration for the service, which links to users\u2019 bank accounts and periodically stashes away small sums for them, came in part from watching his friends work very hard at decent-paying jobs but still struggle to get out from under student-loan or credit-card debt.\n\nWhen users reach savings goals they receive congratulatory text messages featuring celebrity pictures and comments like \u201cIt\u2019s raining savings.\u201d\n\nSays Mr. Bloch, \u201cWe\u2019re activating a customer segment that doesn\u2019t really get spoken to well by traditional banks.\u201d\n\nMs. Berman is a reporter for MarketWatch in New York.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-surprising-relationship-between-taxes-and-charitable-giving-1450062191", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Illustration: John Kuczala\n\nWhen it comes to charitable giving, it\u2019s well known that taxes matter. The promise of a big deduction is a great way to get people to open their checkbooks.\n\nYet the relationship between taxes and giving isn\u2019t as simple as it looks.\n\nResearchers have been studying the issue for years, some by sifting through masses of tax-return data, others by handing people money and seeing how their donation decisions change when they are \u201ctaxed\u201d in various ways. The results show that the money and taxes relationship is a lot more nuanced than the idea that a bigger deduction means a bigger donation\u2014with significant implications for both charities and policy makers.\n\nFor instance, research suggests that the system of itemized deductions the U.S. has been using for decades is much less effective at spurring donations than tax systems in other countries that, for instance, offer charities matching donations. Still other research suggests people may even be willing to give money voluntarily to the government\u2014if the government gives them the chance to direct the money to a cause they approve of.\n\nMeanwhile, some scientists have found that the brain reacts the same way to making donations as it does to paying taxes, if the taxes are clearly being used for a good cause\u2014suggesting that people may be more willing to pay taxes if they know how the money\u2019s being used. And some findings even suggest that offering deductions for charitable giving may promote good health.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the findings, and the lessons they hold for policy planners.\n\nWatch what people do, not say\n\nOne of the basic findings of the recent tax research is that people don\u2019t admit how important taxes are until push comes to shove.\n\nConsider the findings from the U.S. Trust Study of High Net Worth Philanthropy, conducted by U.S. Trust and the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy every two years since 2005. According to the survey, people\u2019s main motivations for giving were to make a difference (73.5%) and for personal satisfaction (73.1%). Receiving a tax benefit came way down in 11th place in the list of possible reasons, cited by just 34.4% of respondents. And most people insisted that they\u2019d still give the same amount even if they received no income-tax deduction for charitable giving.\n\nBut their answers changed when there was a real possibility of that tax deduction being reduced, indicating that people were happy to say that the tax deduction wasn\u2019t all that important, until they came face to face with the likelihood that it might go away. In 2009, when the future of the charitable deduction was being debated, 67% of people said they would decrease charitable giving if the deduction were eliminated, up from 46.6% in 2005. In 2013, when the debate about capping the deduction had died down, the results returned more or less to the 2005 levels.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as expected, when tax rates are higher, people are generally willing to give more. Jon Bakija of Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., examined income-tax-return data to track donations over almost four decades. Back in the 1970s, when the top rate of federal income tax was 70%, wealthier Americans (people with incomes of over $500,000 in 2007 dollars) gave around twice as much of their money to charity than they did in 2007, when the top rate had fallen to 35%. People in other income brackets, on the other hand, saw smaller changes in their tax rates, and made smaller changes to their charitable giving.\n\nThe reason: A higher tax rate tends to favor charitable giving, because it gives people a larger charitable deduction, and hence a lower price of giving. If you pay tax at the 28% rate, for example, the \u201cprice\u201d of making a $1 donation is 72 cents, because you get 28 cents back as long as you itemize the deduction on your tax return. If your tax rate is 40%, making a donation becomes even cheaper: Your price is 60 cents.\n\nDeductions may not be the best way to go\n\nFor decades, Americans have been using the same tax system to handle donations: itemized deductions. But some recent research suggests that this venerable method may not be the best way to spark giving.\n\nPhilip Grossman, economics professor at Monash University in Australia, has conducted several experiments with Catherine Eckel of Texas A&M University and others. They looked at itemized deductions versus a matching system such as that used in the U.K., where charities can claim an extra 25 pence from the government for every pound donated by a taxpayer.\n\nIn one experiment, they gave people money and offered them a list of charities to which they could donate. Some people were offered a 50% rebate on their donations, others a dollar-for-dollar match with no rebate or deduction. In both scenarios, the charity received $1 for every 50 cents the participant donated. But people\u2019s reactions were far from equal.\n\n\u201cWe found consistently that subjects gave more under the matching system than the rebate system,\u201d says Prof. Grossman.\n\nIn a follow-up study, Prof. Grossman and his colleagues offered people a choice between getting a rebate and getting a match, and were surprised to find that about half chose each option, meaning they didn\u2019t see one as being more advantageous than the other. And, again, the people receiving the match gave more generously than those receiving the rebate.\n\nSeparate research by Kimberley Scharf at Warwick University and Sarah Smith at the University of Bristol has reached similar conclusions: People respond more to the match than the rebate.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, other research has found that the amount of a match doesn\u2019t necessarily matter\u2014just the fact that there is a match.\n\nJohn A. List of the University of Chicago and Dean Karlan of Yale University reached this conclusion by conducting a large-scale field experiment, joining with a nonprofit to send fundraising letters to 50,000 households. Some were offered various levels of matching donations by a wealthy supporter of the charity, while others were simply asked to donate, with no match available.\n\nThe subsidy had a substantial effect: Just by offering a match, the charity was able to raise about 20% more money. But the amount of the match \u201cdidn\u2019t matter at all,\u201d Prof. List says. Those who were offered a one-for-one match gave about the same as those who were offered a 2-for-1 or three-for-one match.\n\nSince the original 2006 study, Prof. List and his colleague have repeated the experiment in slightly different forms and found that the results are \u201cpretty stable\u201d: a subsidy leads to more giving, but the amount of the subsidy doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nThe implication for tax policy, Prof. List says, is that increasing the amount of an existing incentive is likely to be less effective than creating an entirely new incentive. \u201cGoing from zero to something positive is a big change, but going from something positive to something a little more positive is less important. So we should look for places where there is not currently any charitable contribution benefit. Those are the places where we\u2019ll find the largest changes in behavior.\u201d\n\nGovernment grants can hurt giving\n\nAnother aspect of government policy that may be damping donations is making grants directly to charities.\n\nA. Abigail Payne of McMaster University in Ontario and James Andreoni of the University of California, San Diego, have combed through the tax returns of thousands of charitable organizations, looking at their funding sources and using a variety of statistical techniques to establish the effect of government grants on subsequent private donations.\n\nTheir overall results: A government grant of $10,000 reduces giving by about $7,500. Part of this is because of an economic effect called \u201ccrowding out\u201d\u2014when people know that the government is contributing to a charity, they feel less need to make personal contributions, because their tax money is already going to that cause. But it\u2019s also because of the behavior of the charities themselves.\n\n\u201cA lot of that fall in private giving is attributable to the charity cutting back on its fundraising efforts\u201d when they get government grants, says Prof. Payne.\n\nSo, should the government stay out of the grant-giving business? That\u2019s probably not a good idea, Prof. Payne says. The government has an important role to play in supplementing private donations and ensuring a fairer distribution of cash. Otherwise, charities in rich areas would likely receive more money than those in poor neighborhoods, and those that tug at the heart strings (such as puppy shelters) would receive more than those that serve important but less-popular causes (such as halfway houses for parolees).\n\n\u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t do something, there will be an underprovision,\u201d Prof. Payne says. \u201cThe question is, what\u2019s the most effective way for the government to be engaged so that it actually adds to the provision, and it\u2019s not just serving as a substitute.\u201d\n\nHer recent research suggests a possible answer to that question. She and her colleagues studied charities in the U.K. that had won grants from the National Lottery\u2014and found that these grants did not crowd out other sources of income.\n\nThe difference, she says, could be that the lottery grants were mostly for very specific functions that were separate from the charities\u2019 day-to-day activities. So rather than replacing existing funding, they added something new. She gives the example of a homeless shelter that wins a grant to start up a new nutrition program. The money will go into establishing a new program, but the organization will still need to raise money from private donors to fund the shelter.\n\nPeople will give extra to government\n\nTaxes are one thing\u2014they\u2019re inevitable, and people are resigned to them, even if they would like to keep their payments as small as possible. But researchers have found that people will actually give extra money to the government under the right circumstances.\n\nIn another experiment by Prof. Grossman and his colleagues, people were given money and provided with a list of organizations to which they could donate: governmental organizations and equivalent private charities.\n\nAlthough people did give more to the private charities, it was much closer than Prof. Grossman had expected: People gave on average 22% of their money to government and 27% to the private charities. In a separate experiment published this year, the same researchers found that people are more likely to give donations to the government when they\u2019re given more choice over where their money goes. \u201cPeople are probably never going to be overly generous to government,\u201d says Prof. Grossman, \u201cbut when you give them some choice in how the money they\u2019re contributing is going to be spent, it might make taxation a bit less negative in their minds, and you might get a bit more.\u201d\n\nWaste drives down donations\n\nBeyond the simple higher-taxes-spur-more-giving equation, some studies reveal a more complex dynamic at work. For instance, when facing high taxes, some people may give less than they otherwise would if they think the government is wasting their tax dollars.\n\nRoman Sheremeta of Case Western Reserve University, and his colleague Neslihan Uler of University of Michigan, had students perform tasks for which they could earn money and gave them the opportunity to donate part of their earnings to charity. Their income was then taxed and the money redistributed among the group. The idea of the study was to mimic the setup of society as a whole, in which the government raises taxes and uses the money for the common good\u2014in theory at least.\n\nIn one variation, some participants were told that a portion of the tax money would simply be kept by the experimenter, the equivalent of the government wasting tax dollars. When that was the case, donations tanked. One theory is that people felt angry at their money being wasted, and that reduced their altruism toward charitable causes, or made them view the charities as potentially wasteful.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a perception among many people that government is wasting money or using it on issues they don\u2019t care about,\u201d says Prof. Sheremeta. \u201cOur study shows that this has an effect on charitable giving. So maybe we should be talking less about the amount of taxation, and more about the perception of waste.\u201d\n\nFor policy makers, that means \u201cit might be worthwhile to make an effort to convince individuals that collected taxes are being used for public services efficiently,\u201d he says.\n\nPaying taxes feels a lot like giving\n\nOther researchers have been approaching the topic of voluntary and involuntary giving from a very different angle: conducting brain scans on people as they give money to charity and as they pay a \u201ctax.\u201d The surprising result is that people\u2019s brains react in very similar ways in both situations.\n\nUlrich Mayr, a psychology professor at the University of Oregon, and his colleagues gave subjects $100 each, and then presented them with different scenarios. In some, they were allowed to choose whether to give money to a local food bank, and in others they simply had money taken away from them and given to the same charity. All the while, their brains were being scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nThe brain scans showed very similar \u201creward\u201d responses in most people\u2019s brains whether they chose to keep the money, donate it or had it taken away from them. The initial study in 2007 tested just 19 people, but Prof. Mayr and his colleagues have spent recent years conducting similar experiments on a much larger scale, and expect to publish those findings soon.\n\nProf. Mayr acknowledges that his experiment represents a \u201cvery idealized tax situation.\u201d A food bank is a cause more people can agree with than supporting the government, and it\u2019s unlikely that many people will experience great satisfaction when writing a check to the Internal Revenue Service. But it does point to an opportunity for policy makers, he says. If the government can do a better job of explaining what tax revenue is used for and showing how it contributes to the common good, people might feel better about paying taxes, and might view it more like charitable giving.\n\nDeductions may improve your health\n\nFinally, tax subsidies for charitable giving may have some positive unintended consequences, according to research by Baris Y\u00f6r\u00fck at the University at Albany, State University of New York. Prof. Y\u00f6r\u00fck has dedicated several studies to looking at what he calls the \u201cspillover effects\u201d of charitable tax benefits. Since the charitable tax deduction boosts donations, and separate studies have found that giving to others reduces stress and strengthens the immune system, he decided to combine the two ideas. \u201cMy hypothesis was that if giving to others is better for health and if tax subsidies significantly increase charitable giving, then increasing tax subsidies may positively affect health,\u201d he says.\n\nHe analyzed data from the Philanthropy Panel Study, a regular survey in which heads of households report both their level of charitable giving and their health. Factoring in changes in the tax code and a range of other variables, he found that a 1% increase in a tax subsidy for charitable giving is associated with a 0.1% increase in the health index. Applying similar methodology, he has found that other \u201cspillover effects\u201d of the tax subsidy for philanthropy include higher rates of voting, more religious attendance, and more donations to political as well as charitable causes.\n\n\u201cMy findings imply that further expansions in tax subsidies for charitable giving would positively affect the health status of individuals in the U.S., but more research is needed,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Blackman is a writer in Crete.

Illustration: A. Richard Allen\n\nIt was 20 years ago that Congress legislated \u201c529\u201d plans, tax-advantaged programs to encourage families to save for college. By most measures, the plans have been a blockbuster success, exploding to $250 billion in assets in more than 12 million accounts and helping parents mitigate the rise in tuition costs and fight the student-debt tsunami.\n\nBut even blockbusters can be improved. As 529 plans graduate to adulthood, experts say they would like to see several changes to make them even better.\n\nThese state-sponsored plans\u2014named for a section of the tax code, and which typically invest in mutual funds\u2014allow college savings to grow tax-free. There is no income limit on who can contribute, and the account can be reassigned to direct relatives of the original beneficiary\u2014a child\u2019s cousins or siblings, for instance\u2014if there is money left over or if the beneficiary doesn\u2019t go to college.\n\nParents or other adults set up an account as early as possible after a child is born, and contributions up to $14,000 (or $28,000 a couple) in after-tax money during the year are exempt from gift-taxes reporting.\u200bThe money grows within the plan tax-free and, if it\u2019s withdrawn for qualified higher-education expenses like tuition, room and board, or a computer, no tax is due. The plans often also come with state tax benefits for residents of specific states.\n\nBut the plans\u2019 design can be clunky. Here is how financial advisers and college-savings experts say that aspects of the accounts and their use could be improved.\n\n1. Entice companies to do a \u2018match\u2019\n\nOne federal tax-code change that could juice participation rates would be to make it advantageous for employers to offer 529 matching for employees, similar to the way 401(k) plans operate for retirement savings, says Andrea Feirstein, a 529 consultant to states and managing director of AKF Consulting Group in New York City.\n\nCurrently, companies don\u2019t receive any federal tax benefits related to 529s, although some do offer payroll deductions to their employees. If employers match employee contributions to 529s today, that money is considered taxable income to the employee.\n\nThree states do offer tax inducements for companies that contribute to home-state plans on behalf of their workers. Utah has a $1,900 state tax deduction per beneficiary, and Nevada and Illinois each offer a state tax credit up to $500 on 25% of matched 529 contributions.\n\nA federal-tax-code change would cost the government in forgone tax revenue, but policy makers might choose to make this switch anyway if it inspired more parents to save for college instead of relying on loans, she says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a point, from a policy standpoint, where you make a judgment, like we did with retirement, that retirement security mattered,\u201d Ms. Feirstein says.\n\n2. Give poorer families a credit\n\nAnother item on Ms. Feirstein\u2019s wish list is a federal tax credit to encourage low- and moderate-income families to save money in 529s. These are the families that have trouble putting away money in 529s because they are\u2014wisely\u2014saving for their own retirement, which, unlike college, can\u2019t be financed with borrowing.\n\n\u201cIf someone came to me and said, \u2018I have X dollars to save, where should I put it?\u2019 I would always tell them to save for retirement first,\u201d she says.\n\nThe deferred tax benefits currently available through 529s are helpful, but a more-immediate federal tax incentive, like a credit or deduction, would help convince parents, says Brian Boswell, vice president of research and development at SavingForCollege.com.\n\n\u201cWhen TurboTax pops up and asks you, \u2018Have you taken advantage of this tax credit or deduction?\u2019 that\u2019s even better,\u201d he says.\n\n3. Allow more changes\n\nOnce parents or other adults have set up 529 accounts, they have to work through the plans\u2019 regulatory restrictions, such as biannual trading limits. Investors in the plans are allowed by law to make changes to their investment holdings only twice a year (it used to be only once a year, but in 2015 that Internal Revenue Service restriction was expanded to twice a year\u2014which is still a tough restriction, in some experts\u2019 view).\n\n\u201cIf there are sudden market movements and you\u2019ve already made your twice-per-year exchange, your hands are tied,\u201d Mr. Boswell says.\n\nGroups providing information to investors\u2014such as the College Savings Plans Network, affiliated with state treasurers\u2014had campaigned for four permissible investment changes a year, though the College Savings Plans Network says it supported the modest expansion that was ultimately awarded last year.\n\n4. Provide a longer menu\n\nThe plans also don\u2019t offer owners as many investment options as they would have with a brokerage account, which makes some sophisticated investors chafe.\n\nEach plan has a menu of investment options, often target-date funds that start with a heavy weighting of stocks and move toward bonds as the child\u2019s projected high-school graduation date approaches.\n\n\u201cSome people feel it just doesn\u2019t give the right investment choices for them,\u201d says Keith Bernhardt, vice president of retirement and college products at fund manager Fidelity Investments.\n\n5. \u200bChange financial-aid calculations to exclude 529s\n\nExceptions should be created so that college applicants who plan to go on to graduate school can have their 529 accounts excluded from calculations about whether they qualify for undergraduate aid, says Dominick Ferraro, founder and CEO of College Select in Greenville, S.C. Aid isn\u2019t as available for graduate students as it is for undergrads, Mr. Ferraro says. \u201cFellowships or assistantships available to grad students are extremely limited to the type of degree and to a particular student,\u201d he says. Deferring use of a 529 plan until graduate school thus could be a good option for some.\n\n6. Get the word out\n\nFor Nancy Farmer, president of Private College 529 Plan, the major challenge facing 529s isn\u2019t regulatory, but rather a lack of public awareness. Three out of four Americans don\u2019t know what a 529 is, an annual survey conducted by brokerage house Edward Jones found in May. And that number has increased over time, starting at 63% in 2012. The result is that a helpful aid for college savings, the 529 plans, might be benefiting only some sophisticated Americans and bypassing many others who could use it.\n\nThis also points out an overarching problem with college savings, Ms. Farmer says: Most families don\u2019t understand what college will cost, and they don\u2019t know how they will save the money. She suggests visiting the nonprofit College Board\u2019s Big Future website to run cost calculators for various types of colleges.\n\nDespite the growth of 529s, three out of four Americans still don\u2019t know what a 529 is, an Edward Jones survey found in May. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe low awareness isn\u2019t because plan sponsors and state governments aren\u2019t trying to educate parents, Mr. Boswell says: \u201cA lot of people tune it out because it\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\nWhat are the chances of some of these changes getting through Congress? The momentum is usually for having more, not less, with 529s. Early last year, President Barack Obama proposed, and then quickly dropped, an idea to curtail the tax benefits for 529s. Instead, Congress made the popular plans even more alluring, by allowing computers as a qualified expense.\n\nRep. Lynn Jenkins (R., Kan.), a legislator behind the bipartisan computer-expense change, says, \u201cThese college-savings plans are already changing, and I believe we will continue to expand and enhance them.\u201d\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News\n\nA big rule change is coming from the Labor Department that will enforce tighter standards on retirement-account advice.\n\nSix years in the making, the rules require brokers and other financial professionals offering retirement advice to operate under a \u201cfiduciary\u201d standard, meaning they have to keep their clients\u2019 best interests in mind when giving advice on money in individual retirement accounts and 401(k)s. At the moment, brokers need only make \u201csuitable\u201d recommendations, which can lead to conflicts of interest, such as recommending items that may be fine for investors but that the broker has a stake in selling.\n\nHow to Invest in Real Estate There are a lot of ways to go about real-estate investment. But typically some combination of four options is considered: VIEW Interactive\n\nThe regulations are meant to help investors make the most cost-effective savings decisions and get rid of hidden fees. But the pending standard\u2014which may be completed as early as this week\u2014could also reshape how investors do business with their financial advisers, brokers and industry analysts say.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the ways the relationship may change.\n\n1. A new layer of paperwork\n\nOne big change will affect IRA holders working with brokers who take commissions, says Stephen Wilkes, an attorney at San Francisco\u2019s Wagner Law Group, which specializes in retirement law and represents brokers.\n\nUnder the fiduciary standard, commission-based accounts won\u2019t be permitted unless investors sign a new type of agreement called a best-interest contract. This allows advisers to recommend investments they\u2019re getting paid to sell, but only if it is in the client\u2019s best interest and with detailed disclosure of the adviser\u2019s potential compensation.\n\nThe Labor Department and some supporters of the best-interest-contract exemption, or BICE, in the brokerage industry say that BICE is practical and ensures that brokers can still receive commissions. Brokers, though, say some aspects of the contract require an onerous level of disclosures, and could add tension to the client-broker relationship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fearful that the very investors we\u2019re trying to protect might become more paranoid as we\u2019re asking them to sign pieces of paper,\u201d says Andrew Crowell, president of Crowell, Weedon & Co., a money-management firm in Los Angeles.\n\nIf investors don\u2019t want to sign the contract, in some cases they can convert their IRAs to fee-based accounts, which don\u2019t take commissions that entice advisers to operate in their own interest.\n\nBrokers, however, argue the fees may be too expensive for some, especially if the investor is paying an adviser only sporadically for transactions, such as a brokerage account that holds only a target-date retirement fund. The added fees might then require investors to pay more for the same level of care.\n\n2. Possibly getting dropped\n\nSmall investors with modest IRAs also face the possibility of getting dropped, brokers warn, since some advisers may not want to deal with the regulatory hassles required to hold on to less profitable accounts. According to a report by Fidelity Investments, 62% of 485 advisers surveyed say they plan to let go of some smaller, commission-based accounts or help them move to other firms.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to say, \u2018Gosh, if I\u2019m dealing with [a big investor\u2019s] IRA with $1 million in it, I\u2019m willing to jump through some hoops\u2019 \u201d to comply with the rules, Mr. Wilkes says. \u201c \u2018But what about Joe Middle America who has $35,000 in his IRA? Do I even want to bother?\u2019 \u201d\n\n3. Changing conversations\n\nAnother thing that will change is the complexion of the conversations advisers are allowed to have with their clients, says Fred Reish, a partner at Drinker Biddle & Reath who specializes in fiduciary issues.\n\nSmall investors with modest IRAs face the possibility of having their accounts dropped, brokers warn. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nUnder the \u201csuitable\u201d standard, for example, brokers are free to make distribution recommendations to clients. Postregulation, an adviser who doesn\u2019t have a signed BIC would only be allowed to educate clients about choices; he or she couldn\u2019t recommend a client roll over money from a 401(k) to an IRA on which the adviser will earn compensation, because it would be considered a conflict under the new standard.\n\nMr. Reish says there isn\u2019t a specific carve-out that would allow that transaction to take place, at least as the regulation was last laid out. So if the investor wants more advice, it will be hard for the adviser without a BIC to make a prudent suggestion without triggering the fiduciary standard.\n\nDespite the hiccups analysts are envisioning, Chris Call, president of ABD Insurance & Financial Services Inc. in San Francisco, says the impending regulations will be good for the industry, getting rid of waste and excess compensation.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, it\u2019s an awesome thing,\u201d Mr. Call says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to save tons of money.\u201d\n\nMr. Kassel is a writer in New York.

But that is where the consensus seems to end. Some believe that investors should start to reduce the amount of money they have in stocks. Others, however, argue for sustaining the stock allocation. What they do have in common is that they believe it is time to tinker with the models, while weighing different reasons to move the stock needle up or down.\n\nHow to Invest in Real Estate There are a lot of ways to go about real-estate investment. But typically some combination of four options is considered: VIEW Interactive\n\nThere is no universal prescription for equity allocation, of course. Much depends on a portfolio\u2019s size, an investor\u2019s age and how soon he or she wishes to retire. Expectations for annual stock returns have ratcheted back since the stock market recovery began in 2009, with many financial planners modeling for annual returns in the 4% or 5% range, down from as much as twice that before the 2008-09 recession.\n\nMeanwhile, the reduced outlook for equities still exceeds expected returns for other asset classes. But for many, all of the volatility of late makes the near-term risk/reward proposition for stocks less appealing.\n\n\u201cReturns expectations have ratcheted down, but the expectation of short-term volatility in the market continues,\u201d says Christine Benz, director of personal finance at fund researchers Morningstar Inc.\n\nOther factors affect allocation decisions, too, such as whether an investor\u2019s portfolio has been rebalanced along the way, or whether it has passively wandered into an inappropriate asset mix for the person\u2019s risk tolerance or goals.\n\nMs. Benz notes than an investor with $10,000 invested in a 50% stock, 50% bond-related portfolio in 2009 would have seen\u2014if the portfolio were left unchecked\u2014a transition to a 70% stock and 30% bond allocation by the end of 2015.\n\nThe good news? The investor\u2019s money would have grown substantially. The bad news? So would the risk exposure.\n\nHere is a look at four percentages of stock allocation for an investor to consider, and the types of investors that might want to consider each of the levels.\n\n0%: No Stocks, Thank You\n\nWho is using this approach: The very rich, those with low required rates of return.\n\nRich, or \u201chigh net worth,\u201d investors have the luxury of turning to a cash-preservation approach earlier than their less-affluent peers, meaning they can afford to protect the assets they have accumulated rather than pursue potentially high returns at the cost of greater risk. These investors might avoid stocks altogether at any age, opting for fixed income or cash.\n\nBut the very rich aren\u2019t the only ones who might use a no-stock approach.\n\nJohn Flavin, a certified financial planner and registered investment adviser with Synergy Financial in Seattle, makes the case that for the nonelite, a no-stock portfolio isn\u2019t inconceivable.\n\nFor each client, Mr. Flavin\u2019s firm determines a required rate of return\u2014the return needed for the investor to accumulate the funds needed to live as planned in retirement. For some investors who have saved carefully or who are able to live frugally, the required return can be low, which means the assets used to achieve it don\u2019t have to deliver anything resembling stocklike returns.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t need to be in the market, by all means you can hold zero stocks in your portfolio,\u201d Mr. Flavin says.\n\nHe says that he works with an 80-year-old couple who have a low required rate of return, 1.5%, and that he has recommended an all-bond portfolio for them. Based on a rate-of-return approach, stocks aren\u2019t necessary for them, he says. Clients who need a 4% return, on the other hand, would likely use 30% to 40% stocks in their portfolio, Mr. Flavin says, and those who need 8% might need to deploy 60% stocks.\n\n30%: Nearly Out Of the Market\n\nWho is using it: Investors with short-term market concerns and those near retirement who want to reduce their risk.\n\nAndrew Sloan, an adviser with Bluegrass Financial Planning in Louisville, Ky., says that for clients within five years of retirement he has been rebalancing portfolios toward a 30% stock and 70% fixed income/cash allocation, rolling back from a 40% stock and 60% cash allocation.\n\n\u201cYou still need to take on some risk with equities to beat inflation,\u201d he says. Where clients are transitioning money out of stocks, they\u2019re not choosing cash, but rather shorter-duration bond funds.\n\nOthers are going down to 30% in the short term to protect bull-market gains.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone to 70% cash in my personal accounts,\u201d says Tim Shanahan, a certified financial planner and president of Compass Capital in Braintree, Mass., a fee-only adviser. And it is an approach he has advised clients to consider, too.\n\nMr. Shanahan says that in the second half of 2015 he began advising many clients away from stocks. He says he decided cash was the wisest bet for the foreseeable future, based on his belief that equities are overvalued, that rising interest rates make rebalancing toward fixed-income riskier than before, and that rebalancing into \u201calternatives\u201d isn\u2019t helpful given that they are ultimately correlated to the broader stock market.\n\nMr. Shanahan says he advised several clients\u2014most within 15 years of retiring\u2014to move from a typical mix of 60% stocks and 40% fixed income to a mix of 50% cash, 30% stocks, 20% fixed income.\n\nThe shift isn\u2019t one he would recommend for millennials, and even for his midlife investors it requires opportunity-cost analysis. Clients using individual retirement accounts can shift into cash without tax impacts. For those invested in non-IRA vehicles, Mr. Shanahan says, it is worth evaluating the impact of capital-gains taxes connected to selling stocks versus the impact of potential portfolio losses.\n\n\u201cThe tax pain is typically much less than losing what could be 20% of their assets\u2019 value,\u201d Mr. Shanahan says. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll personally get back into the market.\u201d\n\n50%: The Middle Way\n\nWho is using it: Middle-aged investors seeking to preserve some of their portfolio after the bull run.\n\nKris Garlewicz, a certified financial planner with Market Financial Group, a broker-dealer and registered investment adviser in Chicago, says his firm\u2019s views on the long bull run continuing began to turn last August.\n\nHe cautions against reactionary portfolio rebalancing or \u201ctiming the market\u201d\u2014never a recommendation for long-term investors. But in recent months, he says, he has told a quarter of his clients to readjust their equity weightings.\n\nHe has helped some shift from a 70% stock and 30% bond split to portfolios containing 50% stocks, 30% bonds, and 15% to 20% in short-term bond funds or alternative investments, with a small remainder (under 5%) in cash.\n\n\u201cA lot of them see this as a time to take a breather from chasing returns,\u201d he says. \u201cThe market has been just one straight line up. Markets don\u2019t go up forever.\u201d\n\nClients aren\u2019t permanently ditching equities, but are using shorter-term investments they intend to revisit later.\n\n\u201cThey want to take some chips off the table,\u201d Mr. Garlewicz says. \u201cIt is what I\u2019d call a \u2018crash protection\u2019 approach.\u201d\n\nMr. Garlewicz says most of his clients are still in the prime of their working lives, ranging from their 30s to their 50s. Many are self-employed or operate small businesses and have lived through a variety of market cycles. Many say they have gained enough in the recent bull run that they\u2019d rather protect their recent growth than continue betting with it, he says.\n\nDoug Bellfy, a fee-only adviser with Synergy Financial Planning in South Gastonbury, Conn., says that for clients nearing retirement, rebalancing along the way should keep them protected from overexposure to stocks. He typically reduces near-retirees\u2019 stock exposure by 2% annually in the five years leading to retirement, moving from a 60% stock and 40% fixed-income mix to a 50% stock, 40% fixed income and 10% cash portfolio.\n\nWithin the stock portion of such a portfolio, he often rebalances the stock and fund picks away from small stocks to emerging markets, figuring that small-caps have had a strong run and emerging markets are now more affordable.\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images(4)\n\n100%: All In\n\nWho is using it: Some young investors, and the \u201cundersaved.\u201d\n\nAll in with stock? There are always people who do it, including entrepreneurs with cash on hand. In theory, younger savers might place all (or nearly all) their retirement eggs in the equities basket, given their long time horizon before retirement, and thus the ability to ride out market cycles. Others may be close to retiring but short of their savings goals, and so hoping that a 100% allocation to stocks will make up for lost time. Few, if any, advisers would recommend such a move.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be hard-pressed to find anyone holding 100% equities\u201d these days, Ms. Benz says. \u201cEven portfolios for young accumulators should still have 5% cash or fixed income just for diversification.\u201d\n\nTarget-date funds for the young, such as those assuming a 2055 retirement, tend to max out at 90% stock allocation.\n\n***\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nAll the cautions aside, Compass\u2019s Mr. Shanahan and other advisers say stocks haven\u2019t lost their status as a valuable tool for investors. Even with downward-calibrated expectations, stocks are still likely to deliver the highest returns, experts say.\n\nSays Mr. Bellfy, \u201cThere are a lot of market headwinds going forward, but I still expect equities to deliver the highest returns among asset categories.\u201d\n\nMs. Hodges is a writer in Seattle.

Illustration: Everett Collection\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average turns 120 years old this month, on May 26.\n\nFor 20 of those years it was my privilege to be \u201ckeeper of the Dow\u201d\u2014the staff person who watched over the globally famous index to make sure it kept on ticking. Not that I alone made the decisions about putting companies in or taking them out, but I had a vote. And sometimes I called the huddle to take such actions.\n\nAlong the way, I learned some interesting things that many others don\u2019t know about this icon of the investment world. Here are my top 10:\n\n1. The DJIA isn\u2019t the longest-running index in the world. That distinction belongs to the Dow Jones Transportation Average. Charles Dow, founding editor of The Wall Street Journal who created these indexes, began with a railroad index in 1884, 12 years before the industrial average launched in 1896.\n\nRailroads were the biggest U.S. companies in Mr. Dow\u2019s day, so a railroad average was appropriate. But after World War II, the rails began consolidating to a very few, while trucking and air transport grew. The index was renamed the Dow Jones Transportation Average in 1970.\n\n2. No stock has been in the Dow the whole time, not even General Electric Co. The Dow started with just 12 stocks of early industrial companies. Of that dozen, only GE is in today\u2019s 30-stock index. But it missed some years along the way: It was taken out in 1898, restored in 1899, removed again in 1901 and reinstated in 1907, this time for good. We don\u2019t know why the early changes were made because no explanations were published.\n\n3. The Dow really isn\u2019t an average anymore. In the beginning, it was. Mr. Dow totaled the stocks\u2019 prices and divided by the number of stocks. Over time that arithmetic became complicated by stock splits, which reduced the price of each share. By 1916, when the Dow was expanded to 20 stocks from 12, GE\u2019s stock price, for example, had to be multiplied by four to correct for prior splits before being \u201caveraged.\u201d\n\n4. Averaging was abandoned in 1928, when the DJIA expanded to 30 stocks. The sum of prices thereafter was divided by a divisor that was adjusted every time a component split its shares, to keep the Dow at the same level as before the split.\n\nStock splits over the years steadily shrank the divisor. On May 27, 1986, the divisor slipped below 1, where it remains. When dividing by a number less than 1, the divisor becomes a multiplier. That\u2019s why the 30 stock prices today add up to nearly $2,600 while the Dow\u2019s index value fluctuates just below 18000. And it is why a $1 move by any Dow stock moves the average 6.85 points.\n\n5. Tech-stock fans didn\u2019t always agree with us\u2014including Steve Jobs. When selecting stocks for the Dow, we Journal editors simply tried to reflect the market in just 30 stocks (minus transportations and utilities). But we never moved fast enough for the \u201chot stock\u201d crowd. Boosters lobbied us to add Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. for years before we did in 1999. We were roundly chastised for waiting so long.\n\nMore recently, Apple Inc. was another stock people wanted in the Dow. So did Apple. One Friday afternoon Steve Jobs telephoned to ask why we didn\u2019t add his company. I explained that the price of Apple\u2019s stock had risen so high (over $600 a share) that it would dominate and distort the index. After his death, Apple split its stock, and it was installed in 2015.\n\n6. The DJIA has risen for 78 of its 120 years, but it bombed in its first year. From 40.94, its first average price, the Dow sank 30% to 28.48 by August 1896 because the heated presidential race (William McKinley vs. William Jennings Bryan) made investors nervous. That was the Dow\u2019s lowest close.\n\n7. The Depression was so bad, the Dow industrials almost started over. On July 8, 1932, the index closed at 41.22, just 0.7% above where it began 36 years earlier.\n\n8. The DJIA is slightly less volatile than other broad market indexes, but it has an advantage. So far in this century, the standard deviation from the industrials\u2019 average daily move is 0.91% versus the S&P 500\u2019s 0.98%. One might think that a 30-stock index would be more volatile than a broader index. But it is also true that smaller stocks\u2014which the S&P 500 has but the Dow does not\u2014are more volatile.\n\n9. Each point move of the Dow industrials means less than it used to. As the index rises, each point is easier to attain on a percentage basis. By points, the big yearly wins and losses are all fairly recent because the Dow is at high levels: The best year was 2013 with a gain of 3,472.52 points, and the worst year was 2008 with a loss of 4,488.43.\n\nBy percentage, the leader and laggard happened decades ago, and within two years of each other. (Talk about volatility!) A 66.7% jump puts 1933 in first place, and a 52.7% drop leaves 1931 in last. As for the 21st century, 2013 ranks 19th with 26.5% and 2008 is 117th (minus 33.8%).\n\nOct. 13, 2008, had the largest one-day point gain at 936.42, while Sept. 29, 2008, was the biggest decline of 777.68. The daily percentage champ is a jump of 15.3% on March 15, 1933, and the greatest loss was 23.5% on Oct. 19, 1987 (followed by the two-day crash of October 1929).\n\n10. The Dow is no longer part of News Corp \u2019s Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal. Since 2012 it has been in the stable of S&P Dow Jones Indices, a unit of S&P Global Inc. (formerly McGraw Hill Financial Inc.), and Dow Jones has no ownership stake. Journal editors still participate in selecting companies for addition and deletion, however.\n\nMr. Prestbo, a former Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Indexes editor, is an adviser to MarketGrader Capital, which chooses components of the Barron\u2019s 400 Index.

The stocks of companies with names at the beginning of the alphabet have higher trading volumes than those that come later, the researchers say.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s because people are lazy, unconsciously lazy,\u201d says Jennifer Itzkowitz, a professor at Seton Hall University and co-author of one of the research papers, along with Jesse Itzkowitz of Yeshiva University and Scott Rothbort of Seton Hall.\n\nThe \u2018A\u2019 team\n\nCompanies have long known that a name that starts with A gets attention quicker; that\u2019s why the Yellow Pages have so many A-named locksmiths, exterminators and takeout restaurants. On a grander scale, there are 54 companies in the S&P 500 with names beginning with A\u2014including the newly named Google parent company, Alphabet Inc. \u2014and just three that start with Z.\n\nAnd in academia, studies show that when the authors of a research paper are listed alphabetically on the report, as they often are, the first author tends to become more famous in the field, with more invitations to be a peer referee and work on conferences, Ms. Itzkowitz says.\n\nThe researchers trace this phenomenon to the idea that people tend to be \u201csatisficers,\u201d a word coined from the combination of \u201csatisfy\u201d and \u201csuffice\u201d\u2014meaning people generally are willing to accept something as good enough without doing an exhaustive search to find a better alternative. \u201cPeople are not computers,\u201d Dr. Itzkowitz says. \u201cThey can\u2019t look for every possible option.\u201d\n\nTechnology is partly to blame for investors\u2019 alphabetical choices, says Heiko Jacobs, a professor at the University of Mannheim, in Germany, who co-wrote a research paper on letter bias with colleague Alexander Hillert. \u201cIn the electronic age, you may rely even more on lists, and the standard sorting scheme is alphabetically,\u201d Dr. Jacobs says. He and Dr. Hillert found that stocks in the top 5% by alphabetical order had 5% to 15% more trading volume.\n\nA better way?\n\nThe findings may chart a course for new companies: \u201cIf you\u2019re about to set up a company and you\u2019re thinking about what to name the company, you should think about a name early in the alphabet,\u201d Dr. Jacobs says. If he had a company, he says, he would give it a name that began with A, \u201cbut it wouldn\u2019t start with Aa because it\u2019s too obvious.\u201d\n\nThe A-to-Z phenomenon might even affect how you screen your stocks.

In March, for instance, the PureFunds Drone Economy Strategy exchange-traded fund launched with the ticker symbol IFLY.\n\nHow can investors avoid the alphabet trap?

Not necessarily. Excluding energy prices, inflation might not be as tame as many think it is. Moreover, the Federal Reserve, which stands guard over inflation, has signaled an unusual willingness to tolerate inflation at a faster pace.\n\nThat is just what could result if the Fed raises interest rates only gradually while the job market continues to heat up.\n\nThe Fed monitors several indexes of inflation, which vary according to what prices are included. The most widely watched by investors, the core consumer-price index, or CPI, rose 2.2% for the 12 months through March. This index excludes food and energy prices. The key index watched by the Fed, however, is the core price index for personal-consumption expenditures, or PCE, which also excludes food and energy. It rose by 1.6% for the 12 months through March.\n\nFew expect that number to surge, in part because of currently depressed energy markets. The Fed itself seems to discount the possibility, as it has signaled it plans to raise rates only gradually. Bond professionals say part of the Fed\u2019s hesitation to raise rates also stems from the fact that it doesn\u2019t want to cause more of the market volatility seen after it raised rates in December for the first time in nine years.\n\nIf, however, the job market continues to heat up, other prices keep rising, and the Fed does tolerate more inflation than in the past, all of that could spell trouble for bondholders.\n\nThe apparent policy shift is \u201ca big deal,\u201d says Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at money manager BlackRock Inc. A further increase in inflation, he says, could at least temporarily cause yields to rise as bond investors turn elsewhere for higher yields to stay ahead of inflation.\n\nBond yields move the opposite way as bond prices, so a rise, reflecting an increase in inflation expectations, would cause many bonds to lose value. That could be a concern for retirees and for people using conservative asset mixes in company-sponsored 401(k) plans, which often provide few fixed-income options.\n\nBut there are things investors can do to cushion inflation\u2019s impact. Those include owning more stocks, holding a diverse mix of bonds and adding certain bonds whose principal value would increase with inflation. Here are some strategies to consider, along with their potential upsides and downsides:\n\n1. Look at what you have\n\nWhether people need inflation insurance depends on what they own. A well-diversified portfolio might already be relatively well protected.\n\nBond professionals believe the Fed wants the PCE price index to rise to above 2% from its current 1.6%. That would pose the most concern to savers in low-yield bank or money-market accounts, whose yields currently average 0.11%, Bankrate.com says. If that rate didn\u2019t change and inflation averaged 2% a year, the purchasing power of a $100,000 account would shrink to about $83,000 after 10 years.\n\nBonds currently don\u2019t offer great returns either, notes Crit Thomas, senior investment strategist at Cincinnati-based Touchstone Investments. But investors in well-diversified intermediate-maturity bond funds can expect to get yields of around 2% to 3%, he says, which, for now at least, should mostly offset inflation.\n\nHe cites Touchstone Flexible Income fund (FFSAX) as a tool for earning stable income. According to Morningstar, the intermediate-term bond fund recently had about 37% of its portfolio in corporate bonds. The fund generates a yield of about 2.7% and ranks in the top 8% of its category for the past five years.\n\nFor a passive approach, Morningstar gives a favorable review to iShares Core Total USD Bond Market ETF (IUSB), which generates about 2.4% in yield. Unlike the Touchstone fund or its active peers, the ETF\u2019s portfolio doesn\u2019t change based on a manager\u2019s identification of opportunities.\n\n2. Own more stocks, fewer bonds\n\nSome advisers say bonds no longer are a good tool for preserving capital. They not only can lose value if rates rise, but yields of high-quality bonds scarcely compensate investors for inflation. Currently, 10-year Treasurys, which are highly sensitive to rate risk, yield only 1.779%.\n\nChris Carosa, an adviser in the Rochester, N.Y., area, says because risks are so high relative to returns, people shouldn\u2019t keep any money in longer-term bonds that they might need within five years.\n\nFor people with longer horizons, owning more stocks is one solution, says Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors in Oklahoma City. Rather than the traditional 60% holding, Mr. Courtney says investors might consider keeping 70% of a portfolio in stocks. Stocks would fare well if inflation averaged around 2% or a little more, he says, though not as well if inflation rose significantly.\n\nThe widely held reasoning: As inflation rises more sharply, that tends to make it difficult for companies to raise prices rapidly enough to keep up with rising costs they incur. This eats into profits.\n\n3. Invest in other corners of the world\n\nGlobal markets move in closer sync than ever, but some foreign economies aren\u2019t tracking the U.S. That\u2019s a reason to own foreign bonds, says BlackRock\u2019s Mr. Rieder, who helps manage BlackRock Strategic Global Bond (MDWIX). Economies in some countries are weak enough, he says, that their central banks might follow policies that will push down interest rates, offering bondholders some opportunities for capital appreciation. He cites Australia, Italy and South Korea as offering such possibilities. Bonds of Mexico and Russia, meanwhile, could appreciate in the event of a commodities recovery, he says.\n\nMany foreign stocks, meanwhile, have higher yields than similar investments in U.S. stocks, says Exencial\u2019s Mr. Courtney. He points to foreign real-estate investment trusts, which yield as much as 4.5% a year, versus around 3.5% for U.S. REITs.\n\nMr. Courtney also expects the dollar to retreat at some point, offering additional benefits for investors overseas. Holders of foreign stocks could see their returns boosted if they sell and convert profits back into dollars, and bond investors could enjoy gains on both return of principal and interest payments.\n\nA low-cost way of adding foreign REITs to a portfolio, Mr. Courtney says, is Vanguard Global ex-U.S. Real Estate Index (VGXRX), which also is available as an ETF ( VNQI ). Each owns more than 600 stocks in more than 40 countries.\n\n4. Add some inflation-linked bonds\n\nThe U.S. Treasury sells bonds indexed to changes in the consumer-price index, known as Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. These offer one of the purest forms of inflation protection.\n\nTIPS have been poor performers recently as worries about the economy and the collapse of oil prices crushed inflation expectations. TIPS funds shed about 9% in 2013 and were down around 1.7% last year.\n\nBank-loan funds, which feature floating rates, have attracted investors looking for rate protection. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nBut at current levels, TIPS haven\u2019t adjusted to the idea that inflation could top 2% if the Fed stands pat, some say. Daniel Dektar, co-head of Amundi Smith Breeden\u2019s Investment Management Group, says investors shouldn\u2019t expect \u201ca thrilling return\u201d from TIPS. But if the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure does edge above 2%, TIPS are likely to outperform conventional Treasurys, and possibly significantly, he adds.\n\nBecause TIPS are complex, individuals usually are better off owning them in a fund or ETF. Morningstar Inc. picks include Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities (VIPSX) and Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF (SCHP).\n\n5. The benefits of corporate credit\n\nBonds of U.S. companies pay a yield premium, or spread, over Treasurys to compensate for their lower credit standings. That works out to yields of around 2.75% to more than 3% for bonds with low investment-grade ratings such as single-A.\n\nIn contrast, high-yield (or junk) bonds may pay more than 7%. But such bonds, which have much lower ratings, can lose a lot of value when markets switch to \u201crisk-off\u201d mode. Early this year, the principal value of some junk bonds fell as much as 10%.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t telling investors to stay away from high-yield,\u201d says Warren Pierson, senior portfolio manager at Robert W. Baird & Co., Milwaukee. Just understand that such bonds have about a 75% correlation to moves in stocks, he says. To get diversification from equities risk, investors need to own highly rated bonds such as Treasurys.\n\nBaird Short-Term Bond (BSBSX), which Mr. Pierson helps manage, recently held about half its portfolio in corporate bonds with an average credit quality of single-A. It yields 1.6% while having an average maturity of less than two years, giving it only modest exposure to a rate rise.\n\n6. A dual role for bank-loan funds\n\nBank-loan funds, which feature floating rates, have attracted investors looking for protection against rising interest rates. Such funds can serve a dual purpose in an inflationary environment, offering investors potential for both increasing yields and appreciating principal.\n\nBank-loan funds own loans to companies with low credit ratings, which thus pay higher yields\u2014rates that float about 5 percentage points above a variable-rate benchmark such as Libor. So, as Libor rises, bank-loan funds eventually pay higher yields\u2014although under loan terms, there could be a significant lag before that happens. Meanwhile, unlike what happens with bonds, the value of the loans appreciates when yields rise, potentially giving bank-loan fund investors an additional boost. Last year, bank-loan funds as a group had a negative return of slightly more than 1%, compared with about negative 4% for high-yield bond funds.\n\nAmong funds rated highly by Morningstar are Lord Abbett Floating Rate (LFRAX) and RidgeWorth Seix Floating Rate High Income (SAMBX). The A shares of each fund yield about 4.4%.\n\nMr. Pollock is a writer in Ridgewood, N.J.

How do I go about putting after-tax money [into my standard 401(k)] so that, say, 10 years from now, when I leave the company, I can roll all my after-tax money into my Roth at a securities firm?\n\nEdward Stevens, Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.\n\nThe strategy you are asking about is an appealing one to people who are already setting aside the maximum salary deferral into a traditional 401(k) or a Roth 401(k), or a combination of the two: If their plan allows, they can put additional dollars into the traditional 401(k) on an after-tax basis and then roll that to a Roth IRA when they leave the company\u2014a move that was simplified by the Internal Revenue Service in a ruling last year.\n\nThe first step is to figure out if your traditional 401(k) plan accepts after-tax contributions. One place to look is the \u201csummary plan description,\u201d available from your employer or, perhaps, on the website for your company\u2019s 401(k) plan.\n\nUnfortunately, many traditional 401(k) plans don\u2019t allow after-tax contributions. Among plans administered by Vanguard Group, for instance, only 18% accepted after-tax dollars at the end of 2014, a company spokeswoman says, down from 19% in the preceding several years. Still, because the option is most common in large plans, about 40% of workers in Vanguard plans were able to make after-tax contributions in 2013, according to a company report.\n\nEmployees who can\u2019t make after-tax contributions could lobby for a change in their plan\u2019s rules. \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t hurt to ask,\u201d says Michael Kitces, director of research at Pinnacle Advisory Group in Columbia, Md.\n\nBut there are multiple reasons that an employer might not want to add this option, which was much more common 20 or 30 years ago, he says. Accepting after-tax money entails added administrative costs, and it is of value only to the minority of workers who already have maxed out their pretax or Roth contributions. Further, it could potentially cause a company to run afoul of nondiscrimination tests meant to ensure that benefits don\u2019t go disproportionately to the highest-paid workers.\n\nAnother consideration: President Barack Obama\u2019s recent budget proposal includes language that would put the kibosh on this strategy.\n\nA previous Encore article on Social Security mentioned that a spouse can receive 100% of the deceased spouse\u2019s \u201cbasic benefit,\u201d but the term isn\u2019t defined. If I delay collecting Social Security until my full retirement age of 66, is that what my wife would receive when I die?\n\nJohn J. Coniglio, Clifton Park, N.Y.\n\nYour wife\u2019s benefit as a survivor would be affected by when you begin retirement benefits and by her age when she files for survivor benefits.\n\nConsider, for instance, a hypothetical couple in which the man begins benefits at his full retirement age of 66 and dies a few years later. If his wife is at her full retirement age or older, she would be entitled to a survivor benefit of 100% of his benefit.\n\nIf she is younger, she could also be eligible for a survivor benefit, but the amount would be reduced. At age 60, her benefit would be 71.5% of his benefit; at age 63, she would get 85.8% (assuming her full retirement age is also 66). A survivor younger than age 60 may qualify to collect if she is disabled or caring for the worker\u2019s minor child.\n\nNote that if the man in our example had retired early with a reduced Social Security benefit, his wife\u2019s survivor benefit would also be reduced. And when a worker delays beyond full retirement age to collect a bigger benefit due to \u201cdelayed retirement credits,\u201d that boosts the benefit for a survivor.\n\nMy wife and I are retired and in our 70s. I have several Roth IRAs that we won\u2019t need during our lives. They will be left to our two daughters, who will have to withdraw the money over their life expectancy. The daughters also have Roth IRAs that my wife and I have been funding by selling investments and paying taxes. Now, I have decided to take money out of my IRAs, instead of selling investments, to fund their IRAs.\n\nMy logic is that this will reduce the money they have to take out over their lifetimes. I will reduce my tax burden and they can let their Roth IRAs grow until their deaths, and then their children can start withdrawing money over their lifetimes. Can you see anything wrong with this strategy?\n\nBill Domm, Northbrook, Ill.\n\nDecisions about how to most efficiently transfer wealth to the next generation are complex, and personalized advice from an estate planner and/or accountant can be invaluable. That said, if your aim is to leave the most to your children, Mr. Kitces suggests there may be a flaw in your approach.\n\nYou say you are using your assets to fund your daughters\u2019 Roth IRAs. For simplicity, let\u2019s assume that over time you drain either all of your Roth IRAs or all of your taxable accounts by doing that. If you have exhausted your Roth IRAs, your children inherit securities in a taxable account. They will owe tax on earnings and capital gains down the road.\n\nBut if you have exhausted your taxable securities, they inherit Roth IRAs that under current law can give them a lifetime of tax-free growth. In that case, each child has both her own Roth IRA that you funded and the inherited Roth. The two Roths are better than one, Mr. Kitces says.\n\nIf your children are in lower tax brackets than you are, there\u2019s another alternative to consider, Mr. Kitces says: \u201cStop liquidating the stocks with capital gains and give the stocks to the children and let them liquidate it themselves,\u201d paying less tax in the process.\n\nEncore welcomes your questions at encore@wsj.com.

I became aware of it on Jan. 1 and immediately took it on Jan. 2, but too late.\n\nFidelity told me to file Form 5329, which I have done. There is a provision on this form which allows the tax filer to request a waiver of the 50% penalty tax if the reason was \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201creasonable\u201d steps were taken to remedy the shortfall. What is \u201creasonable\u201d to the IRS in this situation?\n\nRichard Robbins, Santa Rosa, Calif.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service grants most such requests for waivers, as long as the taxpayer took the distribution as soon as the error was discovered and has a decent explanation, says Ed Slott, a certified public accountant and individual retirement account specialist in Rockville Centre, N.Y.\n\nHe says justifications that pass muster can include \u201cfinancial adviser or institution error, medical reasons, calculation errors or even confusion over the tax rules,\u201d such as in the first year a distribution is required.\n\nYou may hear back from the IRS on your request, but that could take months, Mr. Slott says.\n\nFor now, no news is probably good news. \u201cGenerally, if you don\u2019t hear anything, it means that your waiver was approved,\u201d he says.\n\nAs you note, the penalty for not taking a distribution from an IRA or workplace plan, or taking less than required, is a steep 50% of the amount that should have been withdrawn but wasn\u2019t.\n\nAt Fidelity Investments, spokesman Joe Madden says the company \u201creaches out to eligible customers a few times a year\u201d about the distribution requirements. Fidelity\u2019s website includes a required-distribution calculator, and customers can schedule automatic withdrawals on a monthly, annual or other basis to make sure they take at least the required annual amount.\n\n***\n\nI am confused regarding the amount my wife should receive in monthly Social Security payments now that I am claiming mine. She began receiving her benefits when she retired at age 62. She was born in 1949, so her full retirement age would be 66. I began receiving my benefit this year when I turned 66, my full retirement age. I was under the impression that she would get a bump in her monthly pay to a sum equal to 50% of my monthly benefit. Currently her benefit is approximately 38% of my monthly amount. How does one calculate the spouse\u2019s benefit in this situation?\n\nAl Montgomery, Germantown, Tenn.\n\nA Social Security spousal benefit can indeed equal half of a worker\u2019s benefit at the worker\u2019s full retirement age\u2014but there\u2019s a big caveat. That 50% applies if the spouse waits to his or her full retirement age to collect Social Security retirement income. If the spouse started collecting retirement benefits earlier, based on either individual earnings or a spousal benefit, there is a permanent reduction.\n\nFor individuals born between 1943 and 1954, for whom the full retirement age is 66, the spousal benefit is reduced by 30% as a result of starting benefits at age 62.\n\nConsider an example from the Social Security website of a worker whose full retirement benefit is $1,000 a month. A spouse who starts at 62 would get $350, rather than the maximum $500. That\u2019s a 30% reduction in the spousal benefit, and the spouse\u2019s monthly check equals 35% of the worker\u2019s full benefit.\n\nIt sounds like your wife\u2019s earned benefit exceeds what she is entitled to based on your work record. If that\u2019s the case, there is no increase now that you have retired.\n\nEncore welcomes your questions at encore@wsj.com.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nWhen I turn 70 in November, in what time period should I take my first required minimum distribution so that I won't have to take two in the same year? Can I take my first one this December to avoid that scenario?\n\nJerry Thompson, Orlando, Fla.\n\nYou have another year to worry about this.\n\nRequired minimum distributions from individual retirement accounts and other retirement accounts start for the year you turn 70\u00bd, not when you celebrate your 70th birthday. That means your first RMD will be for tax year 2016, not this year.\n\nBut you are smart to think ahead to the timing of the first two payouts. Under the tax law, you get extra time to take your first RMD, until April 1 of the calendar year after the year you reach 70\u00bd. For you, that means your RMD for 2016 must be taken by April 1, 2017.\n\nBut the deadline for subsequent RMDs is year-end. So your RMD for 2017 would be due by Dec. 31, 2017\u2014potentially giving you two payouts in that single year, which could push you into a higher tax bracket.\n\nTo spread out the tax bite, you could take your payout for 2016 by Dec. 31, 2016.\n\nIt is easy to get confused about the rules for the first RMD\u2014including the fact that the critical April date for these withdrawals is a few weeks before a better-known April deadline, the midmonth tax-filing day.\n\n***\n\nIn an earlier column about the 8%-a-year increase in Social Security for delaying your retirement to age 70, you said those figures are before any cost-of-living adjustments. Are you saying that cost-of-living increases will increase each year\u2019s benefit\u2026and the COLA increases are compounded? Could you clarify this and give examples?\n\nJim Murphy, Peterborough, N.H.\n\nConsider a worker who is entitled to $2,000 a month at her full retirement age of 66, says Laurence Kotlikoff, a Boston University professor and co-author of \u201cGet What\u2019s Yours: The Secrets to Maxing Out Your Social Security.\u201d\n\nIf this individual waits to age 70 to start her benefit, she would get an additional 8% of her full benefit for each year, which isn\u2019t compounded\u2014so an additional 32%, or a total of $2,640 a month, at age 70. That is before her benefit is adjusted for the cost of living, an adjustment that compounds over time.\n\nIn Mr. Kotlikoff\u2019s example, inflation is 2% in the first year, then 3.2%, 5.3% and 0.3%. So he multiplies the $2,640 by 1.02 (to reflect the 2% inflation the first year), and the resulting figure of $2,692.80 is then multiplied by 1.032 (to reflect the 3.2% inflation the next year). Continue multiplying the result by 1.052 and 1.003, and the age 70 benefit is $2,935, he says.\n\n(Note that in the precise year-by-year computations done by Social Security, there is some rounding, generally to the next lower dime.)\n\nThere won\u2019t be a Social Security COLA in 2016, the Social Security Administration said Thursday, because the measure of consumer prices used in the calculation fell in the third quarter from the year-earlier period.\n\nSend your questions for Ask Encore to karen.damato@wsj.com.

Illustration: Red Nose Studio for The Wall Street Journal\n\nWhen it comes to executives\u2019 careers, the biggest financial mistake they make often comes at the very end, when they\u2019re negotiating\u2014or renegotiating\u2014a retirement package.\n\nGetting the right package could make a big difference in how they enjoy the next phase of their life. But far too many people end up scuttling their shot at a good deal.\n\nSome assume there\u2019s no room to maneuver and take whatever the company offers. Or they get blinded by a big lump-sum offer and don\u2019t actually do the math to see how long that cash will last. Others get too greedy and push for a long list of concessions instead of focusing on one or two top wants.\n\nEven in today\u2019s tougher economic climate, experts say, companies are willing to concede quite a bit\u2014but people need to know what to ask for and how to ask. The key is creativity. People must be willing to think through what they really want, and alternative ways the company can satisfy them if their initial request gets rejected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing more flexibility when it comes to things that are not out-of-pocket costs,\u201d says Alan Sklover, employment attorney and career strategist at Sklover & Co. in New York. \u201cFor example, \u2018We can\u2019t give you more severance but if we can, for example, keep you on an unpaid leave of absence and get you to the next year of vesting in your retirement plan, that we\u2019ll do.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOr, he says, he has seen companies offer workers a promotion on their last day, which \u201cmakes for a lifetime of better payments.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the common mistakes people make when going into a retirement negotiation\u2014and how to avoid them. (Of course, some of this advice would hold true for any work negotiation\u2014no matter what tenure the person has.)\n\nPREPARING FOR A FIGHT. Many people approach negotiation as a battle, as though they\u2019re trying to get something the other person won\u2019t want to give, says Margaret Neale, the Adams distinguished professor of management at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business and co-author of \u201cGetting (More of) What You Want.\u201d\n\nInstead, she says, think of it as \u201ca collaborative conversation about how we can make this transition go better.\u201d That includes offering solutions for the employer, such as agreeing to act as a mentor to newer employees or handhold clients in the transition to someone new taking over the departing executive\u2019s job.\n\nThinking of the process as haggling or making demands or threats is a mistake, says Jeff Weiss, a partner at Vantage Partners, a Boston-based consultancy specializing in corporate negotiations. It\u2019s about problem-solving, he says. \u201cI have a set of interests. My employer has a set of interests. If we can explore those, maybe there\u2019s a way to get creative. More often than not there is.\u201d\n\nGETTING BLINDED BY BIG NUMBERS. Too often, employees are dazzled by a hefty lump-sum payout\u2014but fail to adequately assess their retirement needs.\n\n\u201cMaybe a company offers $100,000, $200,000,\u201d says Jayme Meredith, a chartered financial analyst and vice president at Hefren-Tillotson in Pittsburgh. \u201cThey sound like big numbers, but take $100,000 and divide by 30 [years in retirement] and you\u2019re not left with a whole lot every year.\u201d\n\nOnly after people know what they need in retirement can they be sure they\u2019re asking for the right things. \u201cWe advise clients to look even deeper,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much do you need to earn on your assets to fund your retirement, taking into account inflation and things like that?\u201d\n\nFor some companies, the issue may be the impact of a one-time immediate payout, rather than the total dollar amount, Mr. Meredith says. One option is to offer flexibility on the timing of payouts, or ask whether the company might fund a retirement product such as an immediate or deferred annuity. \u201cThis would provide pension-like benefits to the retiree, but passes the future funding risk to an insurance company,\u201d he says.\n\nFAILURE TO DO RESEARCH. Heading into a negotiation, people should think carefully about the issues over which they can negotiate, including what their counterpart wants, what they will say yes to and what might be a good deal. \u201cToo many people think of negotiation as improv theater. They\u2019ll wing it,\u201d Ms. Neale says. \u201cThis is just such a bad idea.\u201d\n\nIllustration: Red Nose Studio for The Wall Street Journal\n\nPreparation could include contacting the company\u2019s retirees to find out what sort of benefits they received, and talking to people at other companies in the same industry.\n\nThere\u2019s a related mistake: failing to negotiate based on objective standards. Rather than simply asking for a perk absent any context, people should be prepared to make the case for that perk based on what\u2019s happening in the industry, says Mr. Weiss.\n\nPeople should be able to say: \u201cI looked at other like companies, people in like companies, people with my form of expertise, and this is what\u2019s happening elsewhere,\u201d he says.\n\nMAKING THE FIRST OFFER. A big mistake is being first out of the gate. Let the employer make the initial offer, says Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, an executive compensation consulting firm in New York. The problem, he says, is essentially people are guessing at what the company will give them\u2014and they may undersell themselves.\n\nThere are two sides to this problem. If the employee\u2019s offer is too high, it might be viewed as unrealistic. That \u201ccan create a negative reaction and shut down the negotiation,\u201d Mr. Johnson says. And if the employee offers too little, he could leave money on the table.\n\n\u201cIf you come in too low, it\u2019s never going up from there,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve offered other people. You don\u2019t know what they\u2019re thinking. You might as well have them start out. I always tell people: \u2018Act a little bit like you\u2019re a rube. You haven\u2019t done this before. Let them make the first offer.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFOCUSING ON CASH. People shouldn\u2019t think that the game is over if the company won\u2019t deliver the amount of money they want. There are many nonmonetary benefits that can be valuable and the company is likely to bend on.\n\n\u201cWhere you may be able to negotiate is with health care and life insurance. Some companies will give as part of the [employee] benefits life insurance,\u201d Mr. Meredith says. \u201cYou may negotiate to take that with you or have the company fund it for a particular time. Disability policies. These are things you\u2019ve already qualified for, and depending on your age or heath, you may not qualify for them on the outside.\u2026That could be something that\u2019s relatively cost-less for the employer but could be very beneficial to you.\u201d\n\nFor executives, though, health care and the like may be the wrong focus. \u201cYou can get it, but you\u2019re using up blue chips to get something that\u2019s $2,000 a month. Getting an extra stock-option grant is worth a lot more,\u201d Mr. Johnson says. \u201cI would focus on that extra restricted stock grant. Instead of retiring in December, retire in January and have them give you an extra grant on the way out. That\u2019s $1 million, that\u2019s $2 million.\u201d\n\nAnother option: Negotiate a consulting contract. \u201cProvide advice to the new CEO for a year. They\u2019ll never ask for your advice, so that\u2019s a year of extra pay,\u201d he says.\n\nGETTING GREEDY. \u201cA lot of people like to nickel and dime stuff\u2014that diffuses what you really want,\u201d Mr. Johnson says. \u201cCome back with the one or two things that you really want.\u201d\n\nFor example, Mr. Johnson says, employees might ask for a laundry list that includes keeping the company car and cellphone, maintaining executive medical care, receiving a partial bonus and taking vacation time before retirement. \u201cThey would be better off asking for extra time, either delaying their end date for a few months or asking for a few more months\u2019 severance, such as 12 instead of eight months.\u201d\n\nAnother reason to limit the demands: Pushing on too many items may move the negotiation out of the boss\u2019s control, Mr. Johnson says. \u201cYour boss wants you to be happy,\u201d Mr. Johnson says. If it\u2019s a buyout, he may even feel guilty. That can motivate him to help, but \u201cif you ask for eight different things, it\u2019ll probably go to the legal department.\u201d\n\nCONFLATING THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NEGOTIATION. People shouldn\u2019t confuse how they feel about the person sitting across the table with the facts of the negotiation at hand.\n\nMr. Weiss says he always negotiates on two tracks. The first track is to be respectful and appreciative of the person and the relationship. \u201cI can do that through my words, my messaging, my tone and my approach,\u201d he says. \u201cI appreciate our relationship. I appreciate you\u2019ve been a great mentor.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s separate from the substance of the discussion, he says: \u201cWhat are my interests, what are their interests, how can we get creative about new options.\u201d\n\nIf you or the other party mix the two tracks\u2014for example, if you give in to a manager who says, \u201cWell, if you respected me you\u2019d drop your request\u201d\u2014\u201cyou\u2019ve lost the negotiation before it begins,\u201d Mr. Weiss says.\n\nACCEPTING \u2018NO EXCEPTIONS\u2019. The company may say there are no exceptions to their guidelines on retirement offers. Don\u2019t listen.\n\n\u201cThere are always exceptions,\u201d Mr. Johnson says. \u201cThere\u2019s no harm in asking.\u201d\n\nFor example, he says, a worker looking to negotiate her retirement end-date might be able to get around \u201cno exceptions\u201d by pointing out that she won\u2019t be able to finish a major project and needs to extend the end date by a few months.\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nPeople should consider, too, that their counterparts in the negotiation are human. Mr. Sklover says one of his clients was losing his job in the trucking industry. Relocation benefits were offered as part of the severance package, but the employee couldn\u2019t relocate because he didn\u2019t want to force his young daughter, who had a malformed skull, to leave the school where the other children knew and accepted her. \u201cThe company doubled his severance based upon that request,\u201d Mr. Sklover says. \u201cSome of the people on the board have kids too and they know how mean other kids can be.\u201d\n\nFAILING TO ASK. Finally, it\u2019s important for people to remember that even if the odds seem stacked against them in a negotiation, they should ask for what they want regardless. It\u2019s better to try and fail than to regret not asking later on. And, of course, they may end up getting at least part of what they want.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t ask for what you want, how will they know?\u201d says Ms. Neale. \u201cPeople are not very good mind readers. It\u2019s incumbent on you to let them know what you want and how getting you what you want will get them a solution to a problem they face.\u201d\n\nMs. Coombes is a writer in San Francisco.

Bond funds had an outflow of $26.6 billion.\n\nWhere did the money go? A lot continued to flow to foreign-stock funds, which attracted $97.4 billion despite hit-and-miss performances in global markets. International-stock funds were down 1.3%, after falling 5.0% in 2014. Many investors are still waiting for their commitment to global markets to pay off, though most advisers still think some foreign exposure in a portfolio is wise.\n\nSo while investors were net sellers of stock funds, it \u201creally was a tale of two cities\u201d based on the U.S./international contrast, says Tom Roseen, Lipper head of research services.\n\nFocus on the Fed\n\nBond-fund performance was mostly down in a year spent in anticipation of a Federal Reserve interest-rate increase, which came in December.

Mainstream financial firms such as BlackRock Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. jumped into the fray, launching investment products that take into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. At the same time, research from Morgan Stanley and others helped dispel concerns that investors have to sacrifice returns to do good.\n\nEight Questions to Ask Before Picking a College Knowing the answers to these questions should give you a financial head start VIEW Interactive ISTOCK\n\nYet many challenges remain before sustainable investing is truly open to any investor. One of the biggest is that there isn\u2019t yet one agreed-upon definition of what makes an investment \u201csustainable.\u201d\n\n\u2018End of the beginning\u2019\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re at the end of the beginning, if you will,\u201d says John Streur, president and chief executive of Calvert Investments Inc., one of the original sustainable-investing firms. \u201cWe can look at 2015 and say this was a transformative year for this investment discipline. We\u2019ve really turned the corner.\u201d\n\nMr. Streur, who took the helm at Calvert in 2015, says last year a consensus evolved: The use of screens to avoid compromising sectors, such as tobacco, firearms, alcohol and gambling, became outdated. Now, the amount and availability of ESG data means investors can judge companies individually, rather than having to eliminate whole sectors based on their values.\n\nAnd thanks to a growing body of data, there is evidence that those who want to invest in companies that pollute less, better manage resources or prioritize workers\u2019 rights can do just as well financially as those who don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIf you invest sustainably, you\u2019ve got just as good a chance of beating the market or not\u201d as anyone, Mr. Streur says. \u201cThat question has been put to bed, and that happened during 2015.\u201d\n\nSome financial giants saw an opportunity and showed their hand last year. BlackRock in October launched BlackRock Impact U.S. Equity Fund (BIRAX), aimed at investors who want to make money and do good. The fund has attracted $20 million in assets.\n\nThe launch came eight months after BlackRock hired Deborah Winshel, previously president and chief operating officer of the Robin Hood Foundation, an antipoverty group in New York, to run a new unit at the firm dedicated to socially conscious investing called BlackRock Impact.\n\nGoldman Sachs, meanwhile, in July bought Imprint Capital Advisors, an asset-management firm that helps clients create portfolios aligned with their environmental, social and governance views.\n\n\u201cWhen you have some of the largest players in the financial-services sector taking ESG seriously, it sends a powerful signal to the markets,\u201d says Fiona Reynolds, managing director of the Principles of Responsible Investment, or PRI, a United Nations-supported initiative whose signatories pledge to incorporate elements of sustainability into their financial decisions.\n\nMs. Reynolds says investors who have signed on to the initiative manage about $59 trillion, or about half of all institutional assets world-wide, a jump of about 37% for 2015.\n\nQuestions remain\n\nWhat is a sustainable investment? That question remained unanswered in 2015 in the absence of guidance from regulators. An October ruling by the U.S. Labor Department, which cleared the way for managers of pension funds and 401(k) plans to consider ESG factors in their investment decisions, was a watershed moment for sustainable investing. But the ruling didn\u2019t consolidate the different definitions that portfolio managers have for \u201csustainable.\u201d\n\nThere is no audit system to assess what companies report as \u201csustainable,\u201d and companies aren\u2019t required to disclose their ESG behaviors and associated risks. Collectively these challenges pose an enormous hurdle to investors and asset managers who want financial products that deliver social returns, industry insiders say.\n\nThere \u201cis a growing awareness that there needs to be reliable and established standards and/or third-party arbiters of what is and isn\u2019t a green bond, an ESG security or a sustainable mutual fund,\u201d says James Dearborn, head of municipal investing at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. \u201cInvestors don\u2019t know who to trust and how to differentiate between sincere sustainable strategies and ones that are more marketing than reality.\u201d\n\nMaze of marketing\n\nTo that end, Mr. Dearborn worked with sustainability research firm Sustainalytics to create Columbia U.S. Social Bond (CONAX), a fund launched in March that aims to emphasize the social benefits of municipal bonds. Mr. Dearborn says he hopes that by using municipal bonds, which have a natural tie-in with social investing in that they are often used to fund things like hospitals, schools and hydroelectric plants, he can cut through the maze of marketing around sustainable investments.\n\nMr. Dearborn\u2019s fund is still small\u2014it has attracted about $20 million in assets so far\u2014but it was one of the 30 new ESG mutual funds and ETFs launched through October.\n\n\u201cI have been in the industry for 18 years, and yet I have seen more interest and uptake [related to sustainable investments] over the past 18 months than I saw over the previous 16\u00bd years,\u201d says Joseph Keefe, president and chief executive of Pax World Funds, a sustainable-investing fund group. \u201cSustainable investing is a way to invest in companies that are part of the solution rather than part of the problem, and while it is still early in the game, I believe it is a winning investment strategy.\u201d\n\nMr. Davidson is a writer in San Francisco.

But those who take the plunge need to be choosy. That bad start in the U.S., after all, was triggered by a far steeper decline in China, the biggest emerging market of them all.\n\nEight Questions to Ask Before Picking a College Knowing the answers to these questions should give you a financial head start VIEW Interactive ISTOCK\n\nFor investors looking to buy an emerging-markets fund, China\u2019s troubles are just one thing to keep in mind when making one of the first and most basic choices among funds: Do you buy an exchange-traded fund that tracks a market index or an actively managed fund?\n\nETFs in general have become increasingly popular in recent years, largely because of lower fees than actively managed funds and the fact that many active managers don\u2019t fare well in performance comparisons with indexes.\n\nBut both options have advantages and disadvantages, and some factors come into play in emerging markets that don\u2019t enter into the decision for other funds, at least not to the same degree.\n\nFor those who are trying to choose between active or passive emerging-markets funds, here are some things to consider:\n\n1. Time tells different stories\n\nIn comparing the performance of an ETF to a similar actively managed fund, investors should look at a variety of time frames, not just recent returns, says Patricia Oey, senior analyst at fund tracker Morningstar Inc.\n\nFor instance, many fund managers in recent years have held much smaller allocations of Chinese stocks than the widely followed MSCI Emerging Markets Index would dictate, Ms. Oey says. Many of those managers beat the index when Chinese stocks faltered in 2011 and 2012, but lagged behind it when the Chinese market fared better from mid-2013 through 2014.\n\nBecause of the uncertainty of how markets will move even in the near term, it is best to examine how active funds have performed compared with index funds in as many different market environments as possible. And that uncertainty is heightened in emerging markets, which tend to be more volatile than many other sectors. Funds with strong 10-year track records\u2014going back to the years before the global financial crisis\u2014are probably the best bet.\n\n2. Fees can be a lot higher for active funds\n\nActive emerging-markets funds tracked by Morningstar on average charge more than 1.5% of assets a year for management and administrative expenses. That is about 10 times the fees for ETFs such as the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO).\n\nFees are deducted from what funds make on investments, so they erode net returns.\n\nBased on performance comparisons, \u201cI am highly dubious that active management really adds any value, especially in the emerging markets,\u201d says Chris Cordaro, chief investment officer at RegentAtlantic Capital, a wealth-management firm based in Morristown, N.J.\n\nBut others say active funds can be worth the higher fees because their managers can take steps to lessen some of the risks of emerging-markets investing, and they point to examples of active funds that have outperformed index-tracking counterparts.\n\n3. Exposure to political risk\n\nWidely used benchmarks such as the MSCI Emerging Markets Index are based on market capitalization, so the countries with the largest markets, notably China, are their biggest components. And some popular ETFs, including Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets, are switching the indexes they track to broaden their portfolios by adding more Chinese stocks.\n\nBut many Chinese companies with the biggest market capitalizations are state-controlled entities, which worries some advisers. Those companies\u2019 actions may be influenced more by political objectives, such as maintaining jobs growth, than by shareholder concerns such as profitability, says Don Wilson, chief investment officer at Brightworth, a wealth-management firm based in Atlanta.\n\nMr. Wilson says active managers will lean toward companies that have consistently strong financial performance. That makes those funds\u2019 portfolios less vulnerable than indexes to market downdrafts, he says. Emerging markets are \u201ca good place to consider active managers,\u201d Mr. Wilson says.\n\n4. Flexibility of active funds\n\nThe emerging-markets umbrella covers a wide variety of countries and companies. Managers of active funds can make distinctions among that huge range of stocks that an index-tracking fund doesn\u2019t make.\n\nJan van Eck is chief executive of Van Eck Global, which sponsors ETFs as well as an active emerging-markets equity fund. The Van Eck Emerging Markets fund (GBFAX) over 10 years has beaten the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by about 1.8 percentage points a year, with an average annual return of about 5%, according to S&P Capital IQ.\n\nGrim stats in China on another 5%-down day, Nov. 27. Photo: STR/Getty Images\n\nMr. Van Eck says there are some compelling arguments for active management in emerging-markets funds. For one thing, he says that with each of the countries in the category at a different point in its development cycle, \u201cyou absolutely don\u2019t want to have exposure to all countries at all times.\u201d Moreover, he says, \u201cthere are a lot of junky companies included in indexes, even in our indexes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want someone who can shift the company, [industry] sector and country exposure over time,\u201d he adds. \u201cIf you want to have one fund for emerging markets, active is the way to go.\u201d\n\nActive funds also give managers the freedom to include stocks from outside the category in their portfolio. The seventh-largest holding of the Thornburg Developing World fund (THDAX) recently was Facebook Inc. Instead of just owning companies in emerging markets, \u201cwe like to think about who is selling into the most interesting trends there,\u201d says manager Charlie Wilson. Over five years, the fund has beaten the returns of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by an average of nearly 4.5 percentage points a year.\n\n5. Lines are blurring between active and passive\n\nETFs that build in elements of active management are becoming more common.\n\nFor instance, as volatility has risen, investors have flocked to iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Minimum Volatility (EEMV). The fund rebalances its portfolio regularly to maintain a focus on stocks that gyrate less than the broad market of emerging-markets shares.\n\n\u201cIt provides emerging-markets exposure, which is risky in general, but by using the least risky stocks within the EM space,\u201d says Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual-fund research at S&P Capital IQ.\n\nOne possible downside, Mr. Rosenbluth says, is that the fund ignores valuation. \u201cIf [low-volatility] emerging-markets stocks get bid up, this ETF will continue to hold them, whereas an active manager would probably sell,\u201d he says. That could be an issue for investors who worry that rising valuations can make stocks more vulnerable to a reversal.\n\nJoseph Nelesen, director of the U.S. iShares product group, says the ETF wouldn\u2019t sell a stock solely because of valuation. However, he says, volatility sometimes increases as a stock\u2019s value rises, in which case the fund might reduce or eliminate its position in that stock.\n\nMr. Pollock is a writer in Ridgewood, N.J.

Photo: Brian Erkens\n\nWhen it comes to health issues that need immediate attention but aren\u2019t life-threatening, more Americans are turning to urgent-care centers\u2014and traditional health-care providers are getting into the game.\n\nOver the past two years, hospital chains and insurance companies have snapped up urgent-care centers in a spate of mergers and acquisitions. Health systems, too, are moving into this space, striking joint ventures with independent urgent-care operators, says Tom Charland, chief executive of consulting firm Merchant Medicine.\n\nOne driver of these investments is the rise in active patients over 50 who want convenient care for injuries and illness, yet prefer being connected to a larger system where their regular doctor may practice and where urgent visits can become part of their medical record, Mr. Charland says.\n\nEstimates of the number of centers in the U.S. are as high as 10,000. The Urgent Care Association of America says it counts about 7,100 full-service urgent-care centers, with 22% owned by hospitals and 15% in joint ventures with hospitals. Surveys by the group show that some 87% of urgent-care-center operators acquired or built a new location in 2014, and that 89% said patient visits increased in 2014 from the previous year.\n\nFor patients, urgent-care centers connected to a health system offer the dual benefit of convenient care and some assurance that they can be quickly transferred to an emergency room or referred to a primary-care doctor or specialist. Conversely, hospitals can steer patients in crowded ER waiting rooms to an affiliated urgent-care center nearby if it isn\u2019t a true emergency.\n\nMedicare patients\n\nRandy Johansen, president of American Family Care, a Birmingham, Ala.-based operator of urgent-care centers, says his company\u2019s centers see a significant number of Medicare patients who have primary-care doctors to manage ongoing conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure but may have a problem that needs immediate attention. American Family Care has some joint ventures with health systems and hospital groups, but its centers that aren\u2019t affiliated with a hospital also have transfer agreements for more serious emergencies.\n\nMost urgent-care centers, which have physicians on staff and operate on a walk-in basis, offer wait times of 30 minutes or less, versus an average wait of four hours for an emergency-room visit, the urgent-care association says. The average cost of an urgent-care center visit is $150 compared with $1,354 for an ER visit, and urgent-care centers accept insurance, with copays similar to a primary-care visit. Most important, perhaps, the centers are usually open evenings and weekends when doctors\u2019 offices are typically closed.\n\nThey have X-rays, lab tests and other diagnostic equipment and handle common illnesses and injuries such as sprains, animal bites, mild asthma, rashes and minor burns, ear or sinus pain and respiratory infections. They can treat minor fractures and allergic reactions and remove foreign objects from eyes or noses.\n\nAteev Mehrotra, an associate professor in health-care policy at Harvard Medical School, says health systems may see urgent-care centers as a new way to funnel patients into their system and keep existing patients from going elsewhere. For example, provisions of the Affordable Care Act base some payments on coordination of care, and if patients are visiting unaffiliated urgent-care centers, the system to which those patients belong may lose revenue.\n\nFor reassurance as to quality, patients can ask whether an urgent-care center is accredited or certified by one of three groups: the Urgent Care Association of America, the National Urgent Care Center Accreditation program, or the Joint Commission, an independent nonprofit. Though voluntary, such designations indicate that a center has passed through a quality review. Doctors can also be board-certified by the American Board of Urgent Care Medicine.\n\nSome experts warn that patients who use urgent-care centers may not establish or maintain a relationship with a primary-care doctor who can provide personalized care and monitor health issues such as chronic illness over time.\n\nBut the urgent-care association says about 66% of urgent-care patients have an outside primary-care doctor.\n\nJohn Gardner, 48, says he and his family have relied on an American Family Care Center in Greenville, S.C., near their home to treat problems ranging from ingrown nails to ear infections. He has a primary-care doctor and believes it is important to keep that connection. Nevertheless, Mr. Gardner says, in his experience, going to the urgent-care center is \u201cso much easier for 95% of the things you come across than trying to get a doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d\n\nUnder a franchise agreement with American Family Care, Bon Secours St. Francis Health System in Greenville acquired the center Mr. Gardner uses and three others in November, and has the rights to build four more. Bon Secours operates hospitals and rehabilitation facilities, and has its own physicians group with 250 doctors, enabling it to link urgent-care patients to ongoing care.\n\nCraig McCoy, chief executive of Bon Secours St. Francis Health System, says his company\u2019s urgent-care investment allows the system to provide the level of quality its patients are used to in a \u201csustainable\u201d cost model. \u201cWe are responding to the voice of the customer: treatment at their convenience, expanded hours, quick visits and superior customer service,\u201d he says.\n\nTimely help\n\nDave Hamilton, 50, had been doing contract maintenance work at an American Family Care clinic in Hoover, Ala., and was driving to his next appointment when he started to feel what he thought was horrible indigestion\u2014accompanied by pain in his chest and numbness in his arm. He called his wife, who told him to pull over and call an ambulance. But instead he turned around and drove back to the clinic.\n\nThere, Mr. Hamilton told the manager, \u201cI think I\u2019m having a heart attack.\u201d\n\nIn minutes, the urgent-care staff examined him, gave him nitroglycerin and aspirin to help improve blood flow through his arteries, and called an ambulance to transport him to a hospital in nearby Birmingham.\n\nSays Mr. Hamilton, \u201cThey had the knowledge and ability to give me the right care when I needed it.\u201d\n\nMs. Landro is an assistant managing editor for The Wall Street Journal and writes the Informed Patient column.

Photo: Fran Martone\n\n\u201cUruguay? You\u2019re moving where?\u201d Needless to say our friends and family were stunned and a little confused by our decision to leave Santa Fe, N.M., and retire to this small country nestled along the Atlantic Coast between Argentina and Brazil.\n\nAbout five years ago, impelled by a search for affordable health care, my husband and I started researching places to retire. One country kept showing up on the list\u2014Uruguay. We planned a vacation to check it out. We fell in love with the historical charm of Colonia del Sacramento, the miles of pristine beaches that run from Piriapolis to the Brazilian border and with the quirky European charisma of the capital, Montevideo. Most of all we fell in love with the incredible kindness of the Uruguayan people.\n\nAfter a few more visits and a lot more research, we made Uruguay our permanent home about a year and a half ago. A stable democracy for some three decades with relatively little corruption, Uruguay has virtually all of the amenities to which we are accustomed, including reliable electricity, decent roads, skilled health care and widespread fiber-optic connectivity. More frivolous things like pedicures and Pilates are readily available, too.\n\nWith the help of a real-estate agent, we purchased a modern two-bedroom apartment in Montevideo, in the barrio of Pocitos\u2014a popular choice among expats for its cosmopolitan vibe. Our home has a balcony and large patio. Plane trees form canopies over the streets, and mid-rise apartments hug the area nearest the beach. Three supermarkets and two shopping malls are within 12 blocks of our home, and my husband has become a regular at the hardware store, where the owner\u2019s lethargic mastiff naps in the entrance.\n\nAn efficient bus system serves the entire country, so we don\u2019t need a car. The fare, roughly $1, frequently covers entertainment, as well. If the bus isn\u2019t crowded, the drivers often permit buskers to perform. We have been treated to flamenco guitar, rap, opera and poetry.\n\nMontevideo is a thriving arts center. The grand old Teatro Solis hosts opera, symphony music, the national theater company and the Montevideo Jazz festival. The national ballet is a few blocks away at the Sodre Theatre. Amazingly, tickets can be had for as little as $6 each.\n\nWe also have discovered wonderful small museums with regularly changing exhibitions, from pre-Columbian to contemporary works. Montevideo itself is an architectural treasure trove. We relish the vibrant local interpretation of classical style found in many of the older residential neighborhoods. The city is rich in art deco architecture, as well.\n\nOf course no place is Utopia. Uruguayan drivers may be the worst on earth. As a pedestrian, it is important to always remember that you don\u2019t have the right of way. Graffiti and litter also tend to diminish the beauty of Montevideo, and like any big city, there is some crime, so the usual precautions should be taken. Still, in most neighborhoods I feel quite comfortable, and I often take the bus at night.\n\nUruguayans can seem a bit reserved at first, but they do know how to enjoy themselves. Carnaval lasts about six weeks during the Lenten season, with parades and performances throughout the city. One of our favorite events is the Llamadas, a parade of African-inspired drummers and dancers.\n\nAs for cuisine, Uruguayans love their beef. Tender cuts are slow-cooked over wood-fired grills called parrillas. Since Italian heritage is common here, pasta and pizza are readily available, too. Meals are leisurely events and often include Tannat, the signature red wine of Uruguay. We have had a hard time adjusting to dining at 10:30 p.m., so if we are by ourselves or with other expats, we sneak in our meal a barbaric two hours earlier!\n\nI always thought I had a prodigious sweet tooth, but I cannot begin to keep up with the local appetite for rich cakes, ice cream and cookies. The king of all sweets here is dulce de leche, a thick caramel product that fills pastries, swirls through the ice cream, spreads on toast and accompanies other desserts like flan.\n\nPerhaps to work off all of those sweets, Montevideans of all ages, sizes and shapes walk, skate, jog and bike along the miles-long, shore-hugging avenue of Rambla. On the beach, soccer and volleyball games spring up all summer long. For us, walking is our primary exercise, with or without our dog, a rescued greyhound. I also exercise my imagination, fantasizing that someday I will join the ranks of the wind and kite surfers who play in the waters of the R\u00edo de la Plata, a huge estuary of the Uruguay River that becomes the Atlantic Ocean about 50 miles up the coast.\n\nThe cost of living in Montevideo isn\u2019t exorbitant, but I wouldn\u2019t call it inexpensive, either. A cellphone or laptop can cost twice as much as a similar model in the U.S. The cost of using these devices, however, is about a third less than what we were paying back home. Electricity runs us about $200 a month, even though we don\u2019t use air-conditioning. Pet food is nearly double the price we were used to, but visits to the vet are about half the cost. Services such as haircuts and watch repair are amazingly reasonable.\n\nOh, and that health insurance we were searching for costs us about $62 a month per person. We also signed up for a service that provides us with emergency ambulance transportation and doctors who make house calls for an extra $20 a month. Copays run from $3 to $9, depending on whether you are seeing a general practitioner or specialist.\n\nHousing prices vary, but a two-bedroom condo can be had in the favorite expat neighborhoods of Ciudad Vieja, Pocitos and Carrasco for roughly $160,000 to $275,000. Ciudad Vieja tends to be the cheapest, as it is still undergoing gentrification.\n\nApostille time\n\nUruguay welcomes foreigners who want to live here. But have all required documents, such as birth certificates, marriage licenses and divorce decrees, in hand when you arrive, and be sure they carry a special type of notarization called an Apostille from the U.S. jurisdiction in which they were issued. For those not fluent in Spanish, it may be a good idea to hire a local attorney to help with the process. But the attorneys should be vetted; fraud isn\u2019t unheard of in these matters.\n\nWe are still adjusting to the slower pace of life in Uruguay. Things will get done, but it may take a while. Also, Uruguayans will always give you the best-case scenario when estimating costs or timing. While optimism is a wonderful thing, there have been times when we wish we had been forewarned about possible contingencies. For example, when we shipped our household goods, our Uruguayan mover didn\u2019t warn us that U.S. Customs and Border Protection might randomly select our container for a special inspection, and that such an inspection could delay the arrival of our belongings for several weeks.\n\nProbably one of the hardest adjustments, however, has been our inability to speak Spanish, especially the unique Uruguayan idioms. We are trying to learn, but our brains, aged 65 and 75 years, are slowing us down. Thank heaven for the Internet. Online chatting with a translation service open in another window makes working with utilities and technical support people doable.\n\nDespite these challenges, we have few regrets. In Uruguay, generations of family members enjoy spending time together doing little more than talking. Living in a country that puts its playwrights and poets on its currency, rather than its generals, makes us glad we decided to spend this chapter of our lives here.\n\nMs. Martone is a writer in Montevideo, Uruguay.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nSure, crossword puzzles and mind teasers can boost your brain power. But a movie, cocoa and sex might be more fun.\n\nRecent research has highlighted what appear to be several intriguing ways to counter the effects of aging on gray matter. Consider these tactics if you\u2019re looking to gain a cognitive edge:\n\nFind your inner artist. MRI tests showed that recent retirees who took drawing or painting classes improved connectivity between regions of the brain, according to researchers at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany. Many brain functions rely on the interplay between regions.\n\nArt instruction also increased participants\u2019 scores on measures of psychological resilience. \u201cResilience means that you cope well with stress and negative environmental and social factors,\u201d says study author Christian Maih\u00f6fner, a physician and professor of neurology at the university.\n\nGo to the mat. A recent study supported by funding from the National Institute on Aging compared a group of people ages 55 to 70 who practiced hatha yoga three times a week and a similar group who did simple stretching and toning exercises. After eight weeks, the yoga group was speedier and more accurate in cognitive tasks and less apt to be distracted.\n\n\u201cThe meditative exercises in yoga aim to help you focus and be aware within the moment by trying to keep distracting thoughts away,\u201d says researcher Neha P. Gothe, assistant professor of kinesiology, health and sport studies at Wayne State University in Detroit. \u201cThese mental exercises seem to affect the way you think outside of yoga practice.\u201d\n\nWatch movies in 3-D. Watching a movie in 3-D boosts cognitive performance, according to researchers at Goldsmiths, University of London.\n\nThose who saw the movie in 3-D were 58 milliseconds (thousandths of a second) faster in a reaction-time test after the movie than they had been before the film; those who watched the conventional 2-D version were only 11 milliseconds faster on the second test, says Patrick Fagan, an associate lecturer in consumer behavior and the psychology of marketing and advertising at the school\u2019s Institute of Management Studies. Movies in 3-D may be more physiologically stimulating, Mr. Fagan speculates, increasing heart rate and blood flow to the brain.\n\nDrink cocoa. Scores on basic cognitive tests jumped 30% during a one-month study that involved drinking two cups of cocoa a day. The Harvard Medical School study looked at older adults with hypertension and diabetes. Researchers credit cocoa\u2019s flavonols\u2014compounds also found in red wine and tea\u2014for helping to increase blood flow to the brain.\n\nGive your regards to Broadway. When Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients belted out show tunes three times a week for four months, they made big improvements on tests of memory and other mental abilities.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nFainting can be a frightening and dangerous experience, sending as many as four million people to the emergency room each year.\n\nNow, with an aging population that is more vulnerable to such episodes, often on a recurrent basis, hospitals are trying to do a better job of identifying the causes of fainting, known in medical terms as syncope, and determining which cases are serious enough to warrant follow-up and hospitalization.\n\nSyncope (pronounced sin-kuh-pee) generally involves a short, temporary loss of consciousness followed by a spontaneous recovery. While it can be a harmless response to stress or emotional upset, or caused by interactions among medications, it can also be a sign of serious and even life-threatening health issues.\n\nIf patients haven\u2019t cracked their head open or otherwise injured themselves in a fall, they may be discharged from the emergency room without a clear diagnosis of what caused them to pass out. But many are admitted to the hospital for further workups, which account for about 6% of all hospital admissions and costs the health system an estimated $2 billion annually.\n\nNew Guidelines\n\nOver the years, a number of guidelines have been published by researchers and medical societies to help doctors evaluate and manage patients with syncope. Cardiology groups are now in the process of updating guidelines with newer evidence. The aim is to help ER doctors avoid admitting patients to the hospital when it isn\u2019t necessary, without missing a more serious condition and sending patients home who then have a stroke, heart attack or other potentially fatal illness.\n\n\u201cPatients may come to the emergency room saying they\u2019ve blacked out, but they may not remember details or there may not have been any witnesses, so it can be very tricky for an ER doctor,\u201d says David G. Benditt, a cardiologist and researcher at the University of Minnesota who has been involved in developing guidelines for syncope. If patients are admitted to the hospital for further observation, they may be subjected to a battery of expensive tests such as MRIs and CT scans, \u201cwhich mostly turn out to be of little diagnostic value,\u201d he says.\n\nOne approach is to evaluate patients in a special syncope management unit, or so-called rapid-access blackout clinic. At the University of Minnesota Medical Center in Minneapolis, ER nurses may send patients for a follow-up visit to a heart clinic where Dr. Benditt sees syncope patients. About half of the time, in-depth conversations with patients and families about their medical history and symptoms make it possible to arrive at a diagnosis, Dr. Benditt says, so it is important for patients to provide as much detailed information as possible.\n\nA common type of fainting known as vasovagal syncope can happen when the body overreacts to stressors such as the sight of blood or severe emotional upset. A sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure can reduce blood flow to the brain and cause a brief loss of consciousness. Fainting can also be caused by a form of low blood pressure that happens to some people who stand up after sitting or lying down, known as orthostatic or postural hypotension.\n\nSimple Fixes\n\nDoctors may suggest simple fixes such as physical maneuvers that help counter the fainting response, including crossing the legs and tensing muscles or practicing standing with the back against a wall without moving for 20 minutes three or four times a week.\n\nResearchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston developed guidelines known as the Boston Syncope Criteria in 2007, identifying as many as 25 factors that put patients at increased risk for adverse outcomes within 30 days. That has helped the hospital safely reduce admissions, while identifying patients who might benefit from a hospital stay of up to 24 hours for observation.\n\n\u201cMost syncope doesn\u2019t mean something ominous,\u201d says Shamai Grossman, an author of the Boston guidelines who is director of observation medicine in the department of emergency medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess. He says he has had patients who pass out every time blood is drawn, and treated one patient who would pass out every time he laughed too hard.\n\nBut a history of cardiac disease such as a prior heart attack or abnormal heart rhythms is generally a worrisome sign. \u201cIf you\u2019ve already had damage to the body\u2019s electrical system, those are generally an automatic admission for evaluation,\u201d Dr. Grossman says.\n\nA study he co-wrote, published in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine in August, identified several risk factors that can be used to predict how long patients might stay in the hospital. Those who had clear vasovagal syncope\u2014passing out from a blood draw or bad news\u2014generally had less than one day in the hospital, while abnormal heart rhythms, coronary artery disease, abnormal vital signs such as heart rate, an implantable defibrillator, anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding and nervous system abnormalities were predictors of longer lengths of stay.\n\nAvoiding Returns\n\nDr. Grossman says his team is now studying how to best care for ER observation patients with syncope \u201cto keep them from coming back and further curtail the need for hospitalization even in patients who may previously have required lengthy hospital admissions.\u201d\n\nIn one syncope case used for a coming textbook on geriatric emergencies, doctors discussed a 76-year-old man who fainted in a restaurant while dining with his family, initially complaining of nausea. When he stood up to go to the restroom, he immediately fell backward and was unconscious for one minute. His medical history included high blood pressure, high cholesterol and depression, and he was on three medications to treat the conditions. He had been briefly admitted to the hospital with chest pains in the past but was told he didn\u2019t have a heart problem.\n\nAt the emergency room, his vital signs were normal, and his blood tests and physical exam showed nothing remarkable. He felt even better after being administered a liter of fluids. He was admitted for observation, where he got more fluids and tests, including an electrocardiogram, and placed on heart monitors. He felt better after 16 hours, had a meal and was able to walk, then sent home with a diagnosis of either vasovagal syncope or orthostatic syncope, the type preceded by standing. An outpatient stress test was set up with his primary-care doctor to make sure he was followed for any developing issues.\n\nWhile some doctors commenting on the case said they might have done other tests to see if problems with his heart or medications might be causing the faint because of his age, Dr. Grossman says patients over 65 who are otherwise healthy and have no cardiac risk factors are at no greater risk than anyone else for a bad outcome following syncope. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t look like anything worrisome,\u201d he says, \u201cthey should be able to go home.\u201d\n\nER teams are also focusing on ensuring that patients get a timely follow-up visit with a doctor or clinic after discharge. \u201cWe tell patients this was the first part of your evaluation, and the rest of it can be completed safely elsewhere tommorow,\u201d says Brian J. Browne, chairman of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of Maryland Medical Center.\n\nMs. Landro is a Wall Street Journal assistant managing editor in New York and writes the Informed Patient column.

Photo: Joe Friel\n\nAs we get older, most of us get slower. But aging athletes may be able to stave off those changes more successfully than most people realize.\n\nThat\u2019s the conclusion that Joe Friel, a celebrated triathlete, coach and author, reaches in his new book, \u201cFast After 50.\u201d As he approached his 70th birthday, Mr. Friel began researching how aging affects athletic performance.\n\nAmong his primary findings: Many older adults are capable of pursuing high-intensity workouts well into later life. Put simply, \u201cto be fast, one needs to train fast,\u201d Mr. Friel says.\n\n\u201cIf we do this, our aerobic capacities decline at a slower rate,\u201d he says. In fact, \u201cpeople will live longer with high-intensity training than if they adopted a long-slow-distance approach to exercise, which is what most of us do.\u201d\n\nWe exchanged emails with Mr. Friel at his home in Boulder, Colo. Here are edited excerpts from that discussion.\n\nIt\u2019s the hormones\n\nWSJ: At what age do we start to slow down, and what happens, in a nutshell?\n\nMR. FRIEL: Most endurance athletes will begin to notice a change in performance by their late 30s. The change is mostly the result of decreasing hormone production.\n\nWhen we\u2019re young we release lots of anabolic\u2014tissue-building\u2014hormones: testosterone, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor, etc. These have a lot to do with recovery and damage control. As we age, the body gradually produces less and less. That means even slower healing of injuries and slower recovery as we move into our 40s, 50s and later.\n\nWSJ: How would you sum up your research? How do we keep from slowing down?\n\nMR. FRIEL: The best way to maintain health and performance for the dedicated but aging athlete is by doing high-intensity interval training, doing strength training with heavy loads, including adequate protein in the diet, and getting lots of sleep.\n\nWSJ: What would be an example of high-intensity training? How would that compare with a traditional workout for an older athlete?\n\nMR. FRIEL: High-intensity training is doing short bouts, or intervals, at greater than anaerobic threshold, where labored breathing first shows up.\n\nAn example would be five intervals of one minute each at high intensity with one-minute recoveries after each. Most aging athletes begin to move away from such training in their 50s and, instead, adopt a training pattern of long slow distances.\n\nA gradual approach\n\nWSJ: Isn\u2019t fear a factor? Aren\u2019t older athletes more prone to injury?\n\nMR. FRIEL: It comes down to controlling the dose (how hard an individual workout is) and the density (how closely spaced the hard workouts are) of training. Dose is controlled by starting high-intensity intervals very conservatively. Only one or two the first time. Then very gradually add more per session.\n\nDensity is managed by making sure there is adequate rest following a hard training session. When in doubt as to what to do, rest more.\n\nWSJ: You write that strength training, particularly with heavy loads, is critically important to counteract shrinking muscles. How would that fit into a person\u2019s workouts?\n\nMR. FRIEL: The athletes who tend to benefit the most from strength training are novices, women and ectomorphs (skinny people who have a hard time adding muscle). With that in mind, I would say that most aging athletes who are healthy and cleared to lift weights need to do heavy-load strength training two to three times a week year-round.\n\nWSJ: If most of our deterioration is due to plummeting hormones, what\u2019s the best way to stimulate those hormones?\n\nMR. FRIEL: Sleep. Anabolic hormones respond very well to sleep. That\u2019s why I emphasize focusing on sleep every day. Cutting back on sleep to fit more things into our daily lives diminishes athletic performance and may even shorten one\u2019s life.\n\nEating adequate amounts of protein also seems to benefit anabolic-hormone production. Most of the research indicates that the average aging person doesn\u2019t eat enough protein.\n\nWSJ: How much sleep do we need?\n\nMR. FRIEL: If you use an alarm clock to wake up in the morning, then you didn\u2019t get enough sleep. One should wake up naturally when the body is ready. If you have to be at work early, then go to bed earlier in the evening.\n\nNo reverse, but fast forward\n\nWSJ: You suggest that the right kind of exercise can slow\u2014and perhaps reverse\u2014the aging process. What does the research show?\n\nMR. FRIEL: Aging can be \u201creversed\u201d for only a brief period. This can be done by training and lifestyle as described above. But at some point down the road the body will cease to adapt and the cells will start \u201caging\u201d again, albeit at a slower rate if the high-intensity training coupled with adequate protein in the diet and ample sleep are continued. There is some evidence that such a lifestyle modifies the aging process\u2014but it never fully reverses it.\n\nWSJ: How do you expect baby boomers to change the research results on aging, athletes and speed?\n\nMR. FRIEL: Most of the research on aging athletes was done with people who started exercising late in life. The baby-boom generation is the first to exercise seriously throughout their lives, and so their fitness level is much greater than that of any previous generation. So I expect to see the boomers set records in every endurance sport in the coming years.\n\nMs. Hughes is a writer living in California and New York.

But he is deeply concerned about the many others: those who, for whatever reason, choose not to squirrel away the money they\u2019ll need in old age.\n\nProf. Thaler just celebrated his 70th birthday in Chicago. The Wall Street Journal talked to him about a variety of topics, including the use of behavioral economics in retirement planning, how to raise the number of workers covered by employer-sponsored retirement plans, and the need for innovation in the spending-down phase of life. Edited excerpts follow.\n\nA good plan\n\nWSJ: Of all the research you talk about in the book, what is the biggest takeaway for Wall Street Journal readers?\n\nPROF. THALER: Retirement savings is probably behavioral economists\u2019 greatest success story. It is a prototypical behavioral-economics problem because saving for retirement is cognitively hard\u2014figuring out how much to save\u2014and requires self-control. And these are two of the most important things that are left out of traditional economics. The assumption that everybody will figure out how much they have to save and then will just implement that plan is obviously preposterous.\n\nWhat are the takeaways for readers? For top management, if the employees at your firm are not saving enough for retirement, realize that it is your fault. And that is because we know how to make saving for retirement much easier and more successful.\n\nThere are four ingredients to a good defined-contribution plan. The first is automatic enrollment. Second, we need automatic escalation, or \u201csave more tomorrow,\u201d to help employees increase their savings rates over time. Third, we need good default investment vehicles. And, finally, we need to stop encouraging employees to load up on company stock. If HR departments and CFO offices would incorporate these features, most employees will have a much better chance at a comfortable retirement.\n\nFor employees, if those things are available, take advantage of them. If they are not, you have to invent your own. Get off your a\u2014 and get in the plan. And if they don\u2019t offer \u201csave more tomorrow,\u201d then just ramp it up one or two percentage points a year until you are at least up to, say, 12%. And put it into some diversified portfolio such as a target-date fund with reasonable fees and then ignore it.\n\nWSJ: It\u2019s been reported that just half of employees in the U.S. have an employer-sponsored retirement plan. What can be done about that?\n\nPROF. THALER: The lesson from behavioral economics is that people only save if it\u2019s automatic. If people just put away what\u2019s left at the end of the month, that\u2019s a recipe for failure. And we can help. My mantra is if you want to help people accomplish some goal, make it easy. And yes, every American worker should be able to save for retirement via payroll deductions. There\u2019s just no excuse for not doing something like an automatic IRA or a myRA [a government-sponsored retirement plan for people whose employers don\u2019t offer one; it launched nationwide recently]. This should have bipartisan support.\n\nIf Congress cannot get its act together to pass some enabling legislation, then other states should follow the lead of Illinois and create their own plan. It\u2019s not a burden on employers. In fact, you\u2019re doing a favor for small employers because they can offer something valuable to employees and be a more attractive place to work.\n\nWSJ: Plan participants still make plenty of mistakes, like investing in high-fee funds. How can we nudge people away from 401(k) mistakes?\n\nPROF. THALER: Automatic enrollment, automatic escalation and good defaults; that\u2019s the three-legged stool that gives people the best shot. And helping people roll [their 401(k) into an IRA] when they change jobs. That\u2019s the biggest source of leakage. The bigger problem is on the \u201cdecumulation\u201d side.\n\nSpending down\n\nWSJ: How can behavioral economics solve that problem?\n\nPROF. THALER: We\u2019ve made good progress on the accumulation phase of retirement saving, but the decumulation phase hasn\u2019t received nearly enough attention. This is unfortunate because the spending-down phase is even harder for individuals to solve, especially since so few people elect to annuitize their wealth. There is no widely accepted default option for decumulation\u2014no equivalent to target-date funds. Part of the problem is that the Labor Department has not been able to find a good way to give firms a safe-harbor option for annuities. But given the dislike of annuities, that may be largely moot. This is a domain begging for innovation.\n\nProf. Thaler\u2019s mantra: \u2018Make it easy.\u2019 Photo: CHRIS STRONG\n\nWSJ: What\u2019s your view on Social Security claiming strategies?\n\nPROF. THALER: Most people start claiming benefits within a year of when they become eligible, although benefits increase substantially if they wait. Employers can help their workers decide whether it might be better to wait longer to start claiming benefits.\n\nHere\u2019s a radical suggestion. Let\u2019s allow people to put some money into Social Security, in a lump sum (say, up to $100,000), to buy additional Social Security benefits. Benefits would be calculated the same way that benefits increase if you delay claiming, at the actuarially fair cost. This would be one way of giving people access to a very inexpensive annuity that\u2019s indexed.\n\nWSJ: If people are worried about running out of money in retirement, is this the solution?\n\nPROF. THALER: That could be one. Most economists, including me, agree that longevity insurance would make sense for a lot of people. Buy a policy that starts when you\u2019re 75 or 80. But for reasons that would make an interesting behavioral-economics study, those policies have not gotten much attention from consumers.\n\nWSJ: Isn\u2019t that odd in a way? Such products take the uncertainty out of retirement planning.\n\nPROF. THALER: People worry that if they buy an annuity like that and then die before the policy starts to pay off, their heirs will lose out. I tell them, \u201cWhat you should be more worried about is if you outlive your money, you will have to move in with your kids. Ask your kids which of these outcomes they are more worried about.\u201d\n\nWSJ: People who are buying such products are adding the return-of-principal feature. People seem to want their cake and eat it, too.\n\nPROF. THALER: That\u2019s another interesting behavioral-economics problem, because no economist would recommend that option.\n\nWSJ: Peter Huang, a professor at the University of Colorado Law School in Boulder, suggests in a recent paper, Empowering People to Choose Wisely via Mindfulness and Thinking Tools, that law and policy can and should empower people to choose wisely for themselves by educating people. What say you?\n\nPROF. THALER: I\u2019m all for empowerment and education, but the empirical evidence is that it doesn\u2019t work. That\u2019s why I say make it easy.\n\nMr. Powell is editor of Retirement Weekly, a MarketWatch e-newsletter.

It is a question that we ask ourselves more, and that becomes more salient, as years pass.\n\nAs we grow older, it is \u201cvery, very common to review your life,\u201d says Berit Ingersoll-Dayton, professor and director of the joint doctoral program in social work and social science at the University of Michigan School of Social Work. It\u2019s a process that inevitably will bring up \u201cthings that we feel good about\u2014and that we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIn the absence of forgiveness, an offense that was committed against us, or some pain that we caused others, can replay in our minds, causing continuing anger or remorse that is often a recipe for bitterness and bad health. A wealth of research has linked the isolation and loneliness that can result to increased health problems and higher mortality.\n\nIt is tantamount to \u201csuffocating\u201d yourself emotionally, says Amit Sood, a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. The effects on one\u2019s health from bottled-up anger and resentment can range from anxiety and depression to higher blood pressure and increased risk of heart attacks, he says.\n\nForgiveness, by contrast, allows one to focus on more positive thoughts and relationships. \u201cIt allows you to free up the real estate in your brain\u201d taken up by negative thinking, Dr. Sood says.\n\nAn alternative stance\n\nOne study suggests that forgiving others may benefit women more than men in certain situations.\n\nResearchers at the University of Missouri found that forgiving others helped protect older women from depression, even when they felt unforgiven by others. Men, however, felt worse when they forgave others but didn\u2019t feel forgiven.\n\nAshley Ermer, the study\u2019s lead author and a doctoral student, says more research is needed to tease out the reasons behind the differences.\n\nSome experts say it isn\u2019t always possible to forgive, especially when an offense is more severe, or when the offender shows no remorse.\n\n\u201cIf the other person isn\u2019t sorry and hasn\u2019t made meaningful amends, the hurt party often can\u2019t and won\u2019t forgive. They are left not forgiving, and hurting and hating,\u201d says Janis Abrahms Spring, a clinical psychologist in Westport, Conn., and author of \u201cHow Can I Forgive You? The Courage to Forgive, the Freedom Not To.\u201d\n\nRather than be \u201centombed\u201d in those raw feelings, Dr. Spring says, people in pain can find relief and resolution through an alternative stance she calls \u201cacceptance.\u201d This strategy entails moving forward from the incident on your own terms, recognizing the magnitude of the violation, but no longer allowing its unfairness to obsess you (possibly with the help of psychotherapy), and choosing a level of relationship with the offender that serves your best interest.\n\n\u201cThis can be accomplished by the hurt party alone, even if the offender isn\u2019t remorseful or willing to make meaningful amends,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWhen you forgive,\u201d says the Mayo Clinic\u2019s Dr. Sood, \u201cit isn\u2019t saying that the other person is right. It isn\u2019t justifying or condoning what the other person did.\u201d Forgiveness, Dr. Sood says, is acknowledging that you have decided to forgo anger and resentment, and that any future relationship with the offending party will be on your own terms.\n\nUnexpected benefits\n\nMichigan\u2019s Dr. Ingersoll-Dayton says she has helped run forgiveness-therapy groups in which participants often have found it helpful to write letters describing their struggles with rage and hurt. Rather than send the letters to the offending party, the group\u2019s members read them aloud and discuss them.\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nFor one woman in her 60s, this led to the realization that the person with whom she was most angry was herself. She began the program feeling angry at her emotionally abusive ex-husband, but after listening to the other group members, she realized she was most angry at herself for staying with him as long as she had, says Dr. Ingersoll-Dayton. This insight allowed her to begin forgiving herself for not being able to leave sooner.\n\nTo seek forgiveness, or to offer it, requires being prepared to be rejected or rebuffed, warns Dr. Spring. But, she believes, \u201cthe healing that takes place\u2026is more deeply cleansing and healing than anyone can accomplish by themselves.\u201d She emphasizes the importance of \u201ccreating opportunities to make good\u201d and \u201chaving the courage to address and redress old injuries in a constructive and healing way.\u201d\n\nThat can be especially pertinent as we age because time is ticking, she says. If you take the hurts and misunderstandings to the grave, Dr. Spring says, \u201cno one profits.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, taking a risk on forgiveness can yield unexpected benefits. A psychotherapist from the Northeast recalls how after her divorce, she and her ex-husband\u2019s mother, with whom she had been quite close, didn\u2019t speak for 20 years. Finally, upon learning that the older woman had lost her husband, the therapist decided to call her.\n\nShe was \u201cthrilled,\u201d says the therapist, who during the reunion that followed told the woman she was sad they were no longer friends. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand what happened,\u201d she told her, \u201cbut I\u2019d like to.\u201d\n\nIt took five minutes to clear up the misunderstanding, she says, after which they began to see each other again regularly.\n\nThe reconciliation had a ripple effect, as well. The psychotherapist\u2019s elderly father patched up his own relationship with the mother-in-law, so two octogenarians who had each lost a spouse regained an old friend.\n\nAnd when the older woman died, she left a favorite sculpture to her former daughter-in-law, a gift personally delivered to her by her ex.\n\nForgiveness was long in coming, but arrived in time for all to benefit.\n\nMs. Cole is a writer in New York.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nWith the Social Security changes in the budget deal, I am more confused than ever. My wife and I are both 64. My benefit at 66 is about $2,330, hers is about $800. I was planning to file and suspend at 66, so she could claim a spousal benefit. We would live off our savings till I turned 70, when I would claim my benefit. This way if something happened to me, she would be able to get $3,100 for the rest of her life.\n\nIs this strategy no longer available to us?\n\nTOM PEKAR, Barboursville, W.VA.\n\nThat \u201cfile and suspend\u201d option is indeed off the table for you, due to the Social Security changes in the new budget law. After a grace period of six months from the law\u2019s Nov. 2 signing, it will no longer be possible for a person to file and suspend so that the other can claim a spousal benefit.\n\nBut you have another attractive option that involves your collecting a spousal benefit based on your wife\u2019s earnings, says Michael Kitces, director of financial planning at Pinnacle Advisory Group Inc. in Columbia, Md.\n\nIn this scenario, you would still delay the start of your earned benefit to age 70, to provide the largest survivor benefit for your wife. She would start her earned benefit of $800 at her full retirement age of 66 and then switch to the higher spousal benefit when you start collecting Social Security.\n\nMeanwhile, when you turn 66, you would file a \u201crestricted application\u201d to claim only a spousal benefit and not your earned benefit. The restricted-application option is also being eliminated under the budget law, but people who are 62 or older at the end of this year are grandfathered in.\n\nThis approach could be even better than your original plan. Your spousal benefit at your full retirement age would be half of your wife\u2019s benefit at her full retirement age, so $400. If she starts collecting at 66, that would give the two of you a combined $1,200 a month at that point, vs. her spousal benefit of $1,165.\n\nHas the file-and-suspend strategy also been eliminated for widows? I am 66 and am collecting my husband\u2019s Social Security benefit. I was planning to take my Social Security at the age of 70, to maximize my benefit by allowing it to accumulate another four years.\n\nMARY KLEMENT, San Diego\n\nThe recent changes in Social Security claiming rules don\u2019t affect widows and widowers, so the budget law won\u2019t require a change in your strategy.\n\nSocial Security planning is important for survivors because many of them can boost their lifetime income by switching between retirement and survivor benefits. That\u2019s often more remunerative than sticking with one type of benefit.\n\nOne common strategy, as you are using, is to start with a survivor benefit while letting an earned benefit grow with delayed retirement credits, raising the monthly payout 6% to 8% for each year you delay from 66 to 70.\n\nIt is also possible to start either an earned benefit or survivor benefit at a reduced rate before full retirement age\u2014as early as age 62 for an earned benefit or 60 in most cases for a survivor\u2014and then switch to the other benefit later without any reduction due to that early start.\n\nMy wife is 62 and receiving benefits now, and I will be 66 in July 2017. Can I file a restricted application at 66 to receive 50% of my wife\u2019s benefit, while postponing receiving my benefits until 70?\n\nPAT SPRY, Greenville, Mich.\n\nYou are in the clear. Because of your age, you retain the ability at full retirement age to file a restricted application for only a spousal benefit, without also claiming your earned benefit. People who are at least 62 as of the end of this year also retain the ability to file a restricted application to collect based on the earned record of a worker whose own benefit is suspended, although that isn\u2019t an issue for you since your wife is already collecting benefits.\n\nSome of us have younger wives who may not have maxed out Social Security earnings and/or years of employment and who may therefore benefit from survivor benefits.\n\nUpon turning 70, I will be collecting Social Security benefits of $41,200 (in today\u2019s dollars) a year, including delayed benefit credits. At that point, my wife will be 45, and we will have been married more than 15 years.\n\nIf I die one day after turning 70, my wife will have to wait at least 15 years until she is 60 to start collecting a reduced amount based on my benefit. During the 15-year \u201cblackout period,\u201d will my at-death $41,000 annual benefit be adjusted by the 15 intervening annual cost-of-living adjustments?\n\nK. BRONNER, Portland, Ore.\n\nYour wife\u2019s survivor benefit would be increased by annual cost-of-living adjustments, says Social Security spokeswoman Dorothy Clark. That means you don\u2019t have to be concerned that the benefit would be whittled away by inflation in the years before she starts collecting it. And your wife\u2019s survivor benefit would be enhanced by the delayed retirement credits you earn by waiting until age 70 to start your benefit.\n\nA widow or widower can start benefits as early as age 60, but the benefit is reduced compared with what he or she can receive at full retirement age. Your wife could potentially collect a retirement benefit based on her own earnings as young as age 62, with a reduction for early retirement, and then switch to the unreduced survivor benefit at age 67.\n\nNote that a survivor benefit is available only if the survivor is unmarried\u2014unless he or she remarries after reaching age 60.\n\nA few years back I transferred about $150,000 from a money-market fund in my 401(k) and rolled it into an IRA. It was the cash component of my portfolio, but I was losing money on it with the 401(k) administrator\u2019s fee of 1%. We\u2019ve since switched 401(k) plans at work, and the new one offers a guaranteed 1.75% return in a money-market/insurance fund. I\u2019ve never read anything about rollovers from an IRA into a 401(k). Can I legally, and tax-free, roll my IRA money back into the 401(k) plan I took it out of a few years ago?\n\nBRUCE COLBY, Avon, Ohio\n\nTax law would allow you to roll money from your IRA to a 401(k), but your 401(k) plan may not allow that, says Ed Slott, a certified public accountant and IRA specialist in Rockville Centre, N.Y.\n\nFurther, Mr. Slott says he would generally recommend against such a move. \u201cYou have more investment options in your own IRA than in a typical 401(k) plan, and you have more control of your funds,\u201d he says.\n\nSome 401(k)s indeed offer an interesting low-risk option called a stable-value account. That would typically use insurance-company contracts or an insurer\u2019s backing to pay higher interest than a money-market fund without the price fluctuations of a bond fund. You might consider using the now-improved account in your 401(k) while shifting dollars in your IRA to a diversified stock fund or other complementary holding.\n\nSend your questions for Ask Encore to reports@wsj.com.

This would give the employees a raise and cut employers\u2019 costs. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe average American retires relatively early, at 64 for men and 62 for women. But with life expectancy rising by one to three months with every year that passes, economists and policy experts say leaving the workforce at such ages is a luxury most people can no longer afford.\n\n\u201cRetirement was a 20th-century invention, but it\u2019s kind of gotten out of control,\u201d says John Shoven, an economist at Stanford University. \u201cIf you go back to 1900, most men worked until they couldn\u2019t work anymore and died a few years later. Now, you can spend 40% of your adult life in retirement.\u201d\n\nWhile the solution\u2014working longer\u2014sounds straightforward, older workers face powerful incentives to retire sooner rather than later, says Olivia Mitchell, a professor of business, economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. Those incentives range from age discrimination in the workplace to certain provisions in the tax code and rules for Social Security and Medicare.\n\nStill, extending working lives \u201cis the most powerful lever we have to increase retirement security,\u201d says Alicia Munnell, director of Boston College\u2019s Center for Retirement Research. \u201cIf you delay retirement, it really reduces the percentage of the population at risk\u201d of outliving their money.\n\nWhat follows are five tax and policy innovations that aim to keep people working longer\u2014by reducing the cost of employing older workers and increasing the financial rewards for workers who stay on the job in later life.\n\nEliminate the Social Security payroll tax for older people\n\nEmployers funnel 6.2 cents of every dollar a worker earns up to $118,500 into a payroll tax that funds Social Security. Employees kick in another 6.2 cents.\n\nBut due to the way Social Security benefits are calculated, employees 62 and older who choose to continue working receive only 2.5 cents of extra lifetime benefits on average for every dollar of Social Security payroll tax they pay\u2014a \u201cclear disincentive to work,\u201d says Andrew Biggs, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nTo induce older workers to stay on the job, Mr. Biggs favors scrapping the Social Security payroll tax for those 62 and older. This would give the employee an immediate 6.2% raise and save his or her employer 6.2%, as well.\n\nDropping the Social Security payroll tax for older workers would have a \u201cmodest negative impact on Social Security\u2019s solvency,\u201d says Mr. Biggs. But the government would offset at least some of the cost by collecting more income tax on older workers\u2019 prolonged earnings.\n\nRequire Medicare to cover older workers\n\nIf you work for a company with more than 20 employees and are eligible for Medicare, you have the option of sticking with your employer-based coverage, which is typically more generous.\n\nTo give companies an incentive to retain older workers, Prof. Shoven proposes transferring the coverage obligation for workers 65 and older to Medicare. \u201cSuddenly, older workers would be the low-cost employees when it comes to health insurance,\u201d he says. If that were the case, employers might even raise older workers\u2019 wages to give them an incentive to stick around, Prof. Shoven adds.\n\nWhile Medicare spending would rise by about 5%, the government would recoup at least some of that cost by collecting more years of income tax on older workers\u2019 wages, Prof. Shoven says.\n\nEliminate the Social Security earnings test\n\nThe Social Security earnings test temporarily reduces benefits for those who haven\u2019t reached full retirement age and earn more than a certain amount.\n\nSpecifically, if you earn more than $15,720 a year and collect Social Security between the age of 62 and your full retirement age\u201466 for people born between 1943 and 1954, rising gradually to 67 for those born after 1959\u2014you\u2019ll lose $1 of benefits for every $2 you earn over the $15,720 threshold. In the year in which you reach your full retirement age, you can make up to $41,880 without losing any benefits. After that, the earnings test goes away\u2014you can earn as much as you want without giving up any benefits.\n\nBenefits lost to the earnings test are generally restored in the form of higher future monthly Social Security checks.But many people\u2014perhaps due to a belief that their benefits are lost forever\u2014instead cut back on work and prevent cuts to their Social Security payment, says Alexander Gelber, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nIn research yet to be published, Prof. Gelber and three other researchers\u2014 Damon Jones, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago, Daniel Sacks, an assistant professor at Indiana University, and Jae Song, an economist at the Social Security Administration\u2014found that as people at the ages subject to the earnings test start earning more than $15,720, they become more likely to retire, relative to people earning less than that. Moreover, of those who continue working, the percentage earning just below $15,720 is much higher among the ages subject to the earnings test than among other ages, says Prof. Jones\u2014suggesting that many people are working only as much as they can without triggering a benefit reduction. In sum: \u201cWe find strong evidence that the earnings test is discouraging work,\u201d Prof. Jones says.\n\nBecause Social Security generally ultimately restores to beneficiaries the money it withholds under the earnings test, actuaries at the Social Security Administration have projected that eliminating the test would have little impact on the program\u2019s solvency. But scrapping the test would increase the fraction of the relevant population that is working by a couple of percentage points, say the researchers.\n\nProvide lump sums for delaying Social Security\n\nToo many people still start collecting their Social Security benefits the first year in which they become eligible, at 62: 42% of men and 48% of women in 2013, according to Boston College\u2019s Center for Retirement Research. By doing so, they forgo a larger monthly payout they would be eligible for if they waited.\n\nWharton\u2019s Prof. Mitchell and three collaborators think they have found an incentive for some people to delay claiming Social Security, which they believe will encourage people to work longer, and so potentially enjoy a more financially comfortable, albeit shorter, retirement. They recently conducted an experiment in which 2,451 participants were offered the option of a lump sum instead of a higher monthly benefit in return for waiting to claim Social Security.\n\nFor instance, someone entitled to $1,500 a month at age 62 who delayed claiming by five years would still receive $1,500 a month starting at age 67\u2014plus an immediate payment of $108,589, based on the additional benefits that person would have received over an average lifespan for waiting five years to claim.\n\nTo get the lump sum, the study participants were willing to postpone claiming benefits by an average of up to eight months from the date they had planned\u2014and most said they would work longer, too.\n\nPeople working longer would bring additional \u201cmonths or years of Social Security payroll tax\u201d to the government, which \u201ccould modestly improve the program\u2019s solvency,\u201d says Prof. Mitchell. But some retirement experts argue that higher monthly payments are preferable, because they ensure that the extra income paid for postponing benefits will last for the recipient\u2019s lifetime.\n\nImpose a new mandatory retirement age\n\nBoston College\u2019s Prof. Munnell argues that bringing back a mandatory retirement age\u2014an age at which companies would have the right, but not the obligation, to require an employee to retire\u2014would help raise retirement ages.\n\nWhy? Because employers would hire more job seekers in their 50s and 60s whom they might now shun due to a fear of having to keep them on the payroll indefinitely. \u201cIt gives everybody a graceful way out,\u201d Prof. Munnell says.\n\nHaving a mandatory retirement age limits \u201cthe employer\u2019s exposure to productivity declines and compensation escalation that typically emerge as workers age,\u201d she says.\n\nIf the mandatory retirement age were high enough\u2014she suggests tying it to Social Security\u2019s full retirement age, which is 67 for people born after 1959\u2014it might also encourage employees to work longer. After all, the average American currently retires by 63, and at least some might interpret a mandatory retirement age of 67 as a standard to aspire to.\n\nMoreover, Prof. Munnell adds, \u201cnothing would prevent employers\u201d from asking high performers to stay past a mandatory retirement age. Under the old system, scrapped in the 1980s, employers had the discretion to retain an older worker on a year-by-year basis, she says. If a mandatory retirement age were reinstated, she says, she would advocate similar flexibility.\n\nMs. Tergesen is a reporter in New York for The Wall Street Journal.

Photo: Adam Klarer\n\nLarry Gitman, age 68, regularly takes trips with Pacific Atlantic Cycling Tours, based in Sharon, Wis. The attraction, he says, is not the rides so much as the friendships. Through the rides, Mr. Gitman has befriended nearly a dozen men who gather annually at a Pacific Atlantic training center in Arizona.\n\n\u201cThe shared experience athletically, socially and aesthetically\u2014plus sharing the pain of long climbs\u2014tends to create a bond,\u201d says Mr. Gitman, an emeritus professor of finance living in La Jolla, Calif. \u201cThe more you ride with the same riders, the stronger the bond becomes.\u201d\n\nThe problem is as old as the idea of retirement itself: Men lose friends as they age, and have difficulties making new ones. While women often develop robust social networks, men usually rely on work for social interaction, an outlet that disappears when they leave the office.\n\nPals wanted\n\nThere are signs, however, that older men are breaking new ground. Increasing numbers of men over 50\u2014through travel groups, fitness clubs, community-service programs, Web-based organizations and other outlets\u2014are seeking, well, pals. And the deeper the connection, the better.\n\n\u201cBoomers are not just looking for relationships; they\u2019re looking for members of their tribe,\u201d friends who share values and experiences, says Brent Green, a marketer and author of a book about baby boomers\u2019 reinventing themselves.\n\nAnd the benefits are more than social. Indeed, a growing body of research links friendship with good health in later life. \u201cStudy after study shows [an active social life] correlates with getting sick less,\u201d says Terry Real, a family therapist and author in Arlington, Mass.\n\nA 2010 survey by AARP, the Washington advocacy group, found that a perceived lack of social support and a shrinking network of friends were associated with loneliness, which, in turn, was tied to poor health. Those who rated their health as excellent were less than half as likely to be lonely as men who rated their health as poor (25% vs. 55%).\n\nA survey in 2011 that asked people if they were happy with their decision to retire found that, on average, retired men and women had one-third fewer friends and spent about half as much time in the company of friends as people who still worked. The survey was conducted by Marketing Analysts Inc., a market-research firm in Charleston, S.C.\n\nRob Pascale, an author and co-designer of the study, says part of the issue for men appears to be that they are socially conditioned to be more competitive and independent than women, who tend to be taught from an early age to develop close connections. Men are also more tied to their jobs, Mr. Pascale says, so they \u201care more likely to feel out of place when they first retire, because the primary way they defined themselves is gone.\u201d\n\nWhile social isolation can be an issue for all retirees, Mr. Real, the Massachusetts therapist, adds that men in particular \u201chave fewer friends with each passing year after 50.\u201d\n\nThat was the case with Tron Jordheim in Columbia, Mo. The 56-year-old marketing executive was finding it tougher to make friends as he aged. Almost everything else in his life\u2014his career, supporting his children, looking after his parents, trying to keep his love life alive with his partner\u2014took priority.\n\n\u201cSometimes the idea of hanging out with friends seems to be a luxury that we cannot afford,\u201d Mr. Jordheim says.\n\nBut recognizing a need for male friends, and a life outside of work and family, he joined a Rotary club, where the majority of men are over 50.\n\n\u201cWorking together on fundraising and community-service programs gives an excuse to be together,\u201d says Mr. Jordheim, who adds that he has met many interesting people he otherwise wouldn\u2019t have known.\n\nHarry Adler, 57, and Larry Pepper, 55, say more men their age are asking to join the Minneapolis men\u2019s book club they belong to. The group now has 20 members.\n\n\u201cThis was a way to have social time but serious conversation,\u201d says Mr. Adler, an education consultant. Each month, the host picks the next book. One rule: It can\u2019t be a book that a wife recommended.\n\n\u201cWe talk about the books, but we have meaningful conversations that are tangents relating to our own lives,\u201d says Mr. Pepper. When one man\u2019s teenage child died, the club became a support network. Members took turns cooking meals for his family. \u201cWe\u2019ve been there for each other,\u201d Mr. Adler says.\n\nWeb enabled\n\nThe Internet is helping older men who want to connect. John Boese says he co-founded GoFindFriends.com in January to help 20-somethings in New York City make friends. After getting more than 500 emails from men 50 and older wanting to participate, Mr. Boese says, he plans to expand the site for that demographic next.\n\nMike Balistreri, a San Jose, Calif., business owner, says he used Meetup, a site that helps people form local groups, to organize the Dribblin\u2019 Geezers, a bunch of men mostly in their 50s who play basketball and socialize twice a week in San Jose. The group sports some 200 members, many of whom hadn\u2019t been on the court for 10 years, says the 54-year-old.\n\n\u201cOur motto is \u2018Exercise without injury,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s common for us to sit around after we play\u2026talking about our kids or health issues, which men don\u2019t do very often.\u201d\n\nRe-enactors unite\n\nJohn Golder of Port Washington, N.Y., says some of his closest friends are men he has gotten to know since joining a group of World War II re-enactors for the British army\u2019s Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. He found the group online while exploring his Scottish family history, he says.\n\nMost of the men are in their 50s and older, partly because of the investment required: upward of $2,000 to purchase the uniforms, period weapons and other gear. The 54-year-old Mr. Golder says the group attends re-enactments and other events in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio and Massachusetts.\n\nWhether sitting in a foxhole firing semiautomatic weapons (loaded with blanks) or dressing up in ceremonial uniforms and arguing whether the badges are displayed correctly, it forges a tight connection, Mr. Golder says.\n\nAs time moves on, Mr. Real, the Massachusetts therapist, says he anticipates that older men will have fewer problems maintaining and creating social ties. The World War II generation, he says, \u201cwould never just go meet a bunch of guys they don\u2019t know and go bicycling.\u201d But millennials, who tend to place a high value on quality of life, he says, are likely to develop more meaningful relationships as they age.\n\nSays Mr. Real, \u201cThe atrophy of men\u2019s friendships over 50 could change.\u201d\n\nMs. Halpert is a writer in Ann Arbor, Mich.

Illustration: Matthew Hollister\n\nThe sky didn\u2019t fall, after all.\n\nAt its September policy meeting, the Federal Reserve decided not to raise interest rates. Had it done so, higher rates would have translated into a loss of principal, at least on paper, for bondholders. (When interest rates rise, bond prices fall.)\n\nBut the apparently misplaced obsession with the Fed misses a larger point: A substantial rate rise isn\u2019t the only way bonds can bite you. The other major danger is credit risk\u2014that is, the possibility of default. And in my opinion, this is just as serious a threat to your nest egg.\n\nOver the very long term, the markets reward taking credit risk, but not by nearly as much as you might think. From the start of 1926 to Sept. 30, 2015, for example, long-term corporate bonds returned an annualized 6.00% on average, compared with 5.62% for safer long-term U.S. government bonds.\n\nAnd this thin margin over the long haul disguises occasional short-term costs\u2014sometimes substantial\u2014for owning corporate bonds rather than government bonds. In the first 10 months of 2008, for instance, long-term corporates lost 15.8%, while long-term government bonds eked out a 0.3% positive return.\n\nMisplaced risk\n\nThe message is crystal clear: Financial risk isn\u2019t just about the possibility of sustaining significant losses. It\u2019s also about the possibility that those losses show up when you can least afford them, as they did for many investors in the dark days of 2008 and 2009.\n\nThe risk in your portfolio belongs on the equity side; the bonds in your portfolio are there for safety, not yield. They\u2019re the dry powder that will see you through tough economic times and enable you to scoop up stocks at the accompanying fire sale; if they\u2019ve taken a big hit along with your stocks, they won\u2019t do you much good.\n\nThis is why I believe in avoiding credit risk in your fixed-income portfolio\u2014not just corporate bonds, but lower-grade and longer-term municipal bonds, too, which also got hammered during the last crisis, mainly because of their limited liquidity.\n\nThis, in turn, informs the choice of fixed-income assets. Since so-called total bond index funds\u2014which, to varying degrees, reflect the broad bond market\u2014consist mainly of high-grade government debt, they\u2019re dandy for the fixed-income pool of the average investor. But with a little effort, you can do better.\n\nTo see just how badly credit risk can bite even a total bond index fund, we\u2019ll focus again on the first 10 months of 2008.\n\nLet\u2019s look first at the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, the benchmark for most total bond index funds. During that period, the total return for this index, which includes corporate as well as Treasury bonds, was negative 3.2%\u2014not horrible, and certainly a lot better than equities did then. On the other hand, a Barclays index of intermediate-term Treasury issues with roughly the same average maturity had a positive return of 5.3%.\n\nBut woe unto those who reached for yield by focusing on corporate bonds. A Barclays index of high-grade, intermediate-term corporate bonds returned negative 11.6%, and a Barclays index of intermediate corporate bonds that concentrates on notes below investment-grade status returned negative 23.7%.\n\nMy advice: Avoid, if possible, bond funds altogether, in part to save yourself the fees, and I would limit my fixed-income holdings to those with a government guarantee\u2014Treasurys and certificates of deposit (assuming you stay below the $250,000 guarantee limit for the latter). Pick an average maturity that reflects your risk tolerance and start a ladder\u2014a range of holdings with staggered maturities, which gives you the opportunity to reinvest money from maturing securities as you see fit, or take the cash if you need it, at regular intervals.\n\nLet\u2019s say that because you\u2019re worried about the prospect of rising interest rates, you want to keep the average maturity of your holdings at two years or less. Purchase equal amounts of one-, two- and three-year Treasurys and CDs, and roll the securities that mature each year into new three-year securities; that way you\u2019ll always have some holdings maturing every year.\n\nIf you need cash to live on or to buy stocks on the cheap, you can sell the Treasurys. CDs are more costly to liquidate, particularly if they\u2019re in a brokerage account, but you can cash out of them as they mature rather than roll them over.\n\nYou come out ahead in a couple of ways with this strategy, as opposed to buying a bond fund. First, if you never have to sell a CD before maturity, you\u2019ll earn about 0.6 to 0.7 percentage point more on them in annual yield than you would on a Treasury of comparable maturity. And second, why pay even the slimmest of fees on a bond fund when you can buy Treasurys at auction at no cost? (You can buy bonds at auction without fees at the government website TreasuryDirect.gov or, with a large enough account, at many discount brokerage firms.)\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nNot for everyone\n\nThere are a few caveats and wrinkles here. In most cases, you\u2019ll need at least a $100,000 portfolio to make this strategy worthwhile (especially if you\u2019re paying even a small brokerage fee to purchase Treasurys at auction). For smaller amounts, the percentage of your assets that you\u2019ll pay for a bond fund\u2019s fees won\u2019t amount to very many dollars. The young 401(k) investor, for example, would do well to purchase a bond fund, or better yet, a low-fee target-date fund.\n\nSecond, if you have substantial taxable assets, then you might want to lower your tax burden by investing perhaps 30% to 40% of your fixed-income portfolio in a short-term or intermediate-term municipal-bond fund, preferably with an expense ratio of 0.20% or less.\n\nFor most folks, the biggest threat to their retirement nest egg is that they\u2019ll abandon their chosen strategy when the going gets tough; if your portfolio lets you sleep at night, you\u2019re more likely to succeed. And in tough times there\u2019s no better sleeping potion than the bonds issued or guaranteed by Uncle Sam.\n\nMr. Bernstein is an investment adviser and author, most recently of \u201cIf You Can: How Millennials Can Get Rich Slowly.\u201d He lives in Portland, Ore.

The rest will sort itself out.\n\nHere\u2019s how we started, what our days are like and what lies ahead.\n\nWheels begin to turn\n\nWe have always enjoyed an active lifestyle, including skiing, running, cycling, hiking and tennis. But it wasn\u2019t until Eric\u2019s final assignment in Malaysia that we became serious about an extended cycle tour.\n\nWe had been riding bicycles every morning for exercise and had logged more than 3,000 miles. During one ride in particular around Penang Island, we met a couple in their early 30s who were finishing a two-year, 25,000-mile cycle tour. They were our inspiration and answered many questions about logistics. We already had the bicycles and felt ready to go.\n\nWe joined warmshowers.org\u2014a fantastic resource for cyclists\u2014and offered rooms in our home for cycle tourists passing through Malaysia. From each guest we obtained more information about routes, planning and gear. We outfitted our bought-in-Malaysia mountain bikes to be more comfortable and road-friendly.\n\nIn particular, we liked the idea of starting the ride the day after Eric retired. We were afraid if we flew back to the U.S. first, we might never return to Asia\u2014finding it too easy to jump back into our old routines. Instead, we shipped a few personal belongings to our storage garage in Washington state. (Our rented house in Malaysia came furnished.) The rest we loaded on our bikes\u2014and we were off.\n\nIn a typical day, we will cover 30 to 60 miles, depending on several variables: the distance between adequate lodging, hills (a hard but memorable day in Vietnam saw us climb 8,500 feet) and weather. We take days off when our bodies need it, when we\u2019re in an area that warrants more than one day of exploration, when the weather can be dangerous, or when we just need a good cup of coffee and Wi-Fi.\n\nMaps and GPS\n\nRoute planning, at first, took longer than we imagined. But now we\u2019ve settled into a routine. Before we enter a country, we scour blogs, tourist websites and cycle-tour companies to find places and routes that interest us. We talk to other cycling tourists and buy paper maps for the big picture. A GPS mounted on my bike (I download Open Street Maps for each country) provides the details.\n\nFor the most part, we map out five to 10 days of travel at a time. The night before each ride, Eric plots the points we hope to reach and looks at the elevation. This tells us how early we need to leave in the morning. Occasionally, we find ourselves on a boat (the Mekong River in Thailand) or train (the Otago Rail Trail in New Zealand).\n\nThe challenges? For Eric, the heat in Southeast Asia was a problem. We tried starting earlier in the morning, drinking electrolyte beverages, eating bananas and resting during the hottest times of the day. But the best solution was simply to reduce our mileage.\n\nFor me, being together 24/7 tested my patience. I like some solitude. One solution: staying in larger rooms in less-expensive hotels. Having a couple of side chairs and a few feet of extra room gives us each some space. (I also blog about our travels at cycle4retirement.com. I can immerse myself in my writing to have a little time \u201calone.\u201d)\n\nA struggle for both of us early on was getting enough healthful food and staying hydrated. Finding lukewarm satay\u2014meat on a stick that is cooked over thin wood strips\u2014was easy. (It\u2019s on almost every street corner.) But it always made me sick. Coming upon a food stall with a propane tank and a gas burner was like finding a hidden treasure. A bowl of hot chicken noodle soup is our \u201csafe\u201d favorite way to energize and hydrate.\n\nFighting homesickness\n\nThere are many days when I\u2019m homesick\u2014not for the house or our normal routine, but for our children and family. (My father thought we were \u201cnuts\u201d to try this, but I think he has gradually warmed to the idea.) I love cooking for them, talking with them, listening to them\u2014just being with them. We\u2019ve been talking about a one-month break as early as July to feed our need for family time.\n\nAll that said, the most important aspect of our \u201cretirement\u201d (if you can call it that) has been the unexpected rewards. Because our bicycles are curiosities and conversation starters, we have the opportunity to interact with many locals and tourists. These encounters often lead to more conversations, invitations, insights into local customs and tips on places to visit, opening up experiences that can\u2019t be captured by the best guidebooks.\n\nOne time at a rural coffee shop in Vietnam with no restaurant in sight, we pantomimed that we were hungry and looking for food. The owner, shaking her head that there were no restaurants or markets nearby, invited us into her living room to sit on her floor and eat lunch with her family and school-age children.\n\nAnother reward is the daily feeling of accomplishment. Finishing a certain number of miles, climbing a large mountain and discovering a scenic byway are rewards similar to completing a successful project at work. Each night we go to bed feeling like we have done, seen or learned something new.\n\nJust recently, instead of choosing the flat, more heavily traveled coastal route around Bali, we challenged ourselves to the road over the mountains in the middle of the island. Although exhausted that night, we were grateful for the vistas\u2014tropical terraced farms, mountains reflected in crater lakes\u2014and peaceful one-lane roads.\n\nHundred dollars a day\n\nWe certainly aren\u2019t living extravagantly; our budget is $100 a day. (We\u2019re using the cash we saved from Eric\u2019s last overseas assignment, hoping not to dip into our retirement accounts until he turns 65.) In Southeast Asia we tried to find lodging with clean and comfortable beds, air conditioning and a hot shower. Currently, we\u2019re camping and cooking most of our meals.\n\nWe have been healthy (knock on wood), for the most part. If we need medical care, we pay cash. (We currently have no U.S. health insurance. A calculated risk, we know.) In the event of a catastrophe, a travel-insurance plan will get us home. We lost some weight in Southeast Asia, but the decrease has leveled off. Notably, our thighs are like steel.\n\nWhat\u2019s next? After Australia, we\u2019ll most likely go to Canada for the summer and fall. Winter is up in the air, but we plan to resume cycling next spring. My first choice would be France: small, low-traffic roads, delicious food, great wine\u2014and inexpensive campsites. Spain and Portugal are options, as well.\n\nIn all, we know we\u2019ve made a good decision.\n\nMrs. Jansen is a wife, mother of three grown children, teacher and cycling enthusiast.

Photo: Bill Owens\n\nBill and Betsy Owens recall the growing concerns they had about their house\u2014built in 1876\u2014in Powell, Ohio. They loved the 12-foot ceilings, the circular stairway and the formal parlor. But when the couple thought about the future, the home\u2019s steep steps and narrow doorways meant \u201cit wasn\u2019t very livable,\u201d says Mr. Owens, age 57.\n\nSo, three years ago, the Owens built an addition. Now there are no steps from the driveway into their new kitchen and great room. A control pad with smart technology turns lights on and off, and three-foot-wide doorways offer easy access for a grandchild in a stroller or, if the Owens should need it, a walker or wheelchair.\n\n\u201cOur homes aren\u2019t aging as well as we are,\u201d says Mr. Owens, a Columbus, Ohio, contractor.\n\nCall it a baby-boom building boom. Hoping to remain in their homes and communities as they age\u2014but recognizing that living spaces can become unsafe and difficult to navigate\u2014people in their 50s and beyond are retrofitting houses, building additions or constructing new digs with age-friendly features.\n\n\u201cYou have to design for a \u2018you\u2019 that doesn\u2019t exist yet,\u201d says Louis Tenenbaum, a Rockville, Md., contractor and founder of the Aging in Place Institute, a nonprofit that educates businesses and consumers about aging in place.\n\nThe big picture is worrisome. A recent study from the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University found that less than 25% of homeowners age 55-plus have a bedroom and full bathroom on the first floor of their homes, a way to get into the house without steps, and no steps between rooms\u2014universal design features that make life easier for all ages.\n\nRemodeling can be pricey. But given the high cost of care in an assisted-living facility or nursing home, such improvements can make sense, experts say.\n\n\u201cPeople have a financial plan, an estate plan and an insurance plan. How about a frailty or disability plan?\u201d asks Mary Tuuk, a geriatrician in Denver.\n\nHere is a look at three families who have taken the plunge.\n\nSay goodbye to steps\n\nTwo years ago, Frank Briber made the case to his wife, Fran Pollitt: He was no longer willing to live in Fryeburg, Maine. The town has no public transportation, and Portland, the nearest big city, is 90 minutes away. \u201cRural Maine is a tough place to live as you grow older,\u201d says Mr. Briber, 65, a retired banker.\n\nThe pair decided to move to Wayland, Mass., a Boston suburb. They bought Ms. Pollitt\u2019s mother\u2019s house, tore it down and are building a brick, French-chateau-style home.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen our parents get old,\u201d Mr. Briber says. \u201cWe want to make it as easy as possible as we enter those years.\u201d For the couple, that means minimal upkeep and no-hassle navigating.\n\nWhen the house is completed in the first half of next year, it will have a gently sloped walkway\u2014really a ramp with landscaping on both sides to disguise it\u2014to the step-free door. The pair\u2019s master bedroom and bath will be on the main level. The powder room will have a wide door, grab bars that look like elegant towel bars, and a vanity with space below for a walker.\n\nThe Owens\u2019 kitchen storage is designed to minimize lifting. Photo: Bill Owens\n\nWhen their adult children (each has two from a prior marriage) and the grandchildren visit, their quarters will be upstairs.\n\nMr. Briber doesn\u2019t want to worry about mowing, so he\u2019s creating a meadow with wildflowers. And then there is the backyard. \u201cWe could have had beautiful tiered terraces,\u201d says Ms. Pollitt, 61, \u201cbut we can\u2019t be going up and down steps all the time.\u201d It, too, will be sloped with few stairs.\n\nThe couple expects to spend $3 million. The hefty price is less the result of its age-friendly features than of high-end finishes and materials. (It will be a passive-energy house\u2014one designed to use far less energy than the typical home.) Still, if they ever have to sell, Mr. Briber says, \u201cthere are enough retired people who would buy this house in a second. There are very few homes designed with aging in place in mind.\u201d\n\nThe bathroom gets an upgrade\n\nSally Evans, 67, and Brian Rodgers, 66, adore their Bellaire, Texas, townhouse and want to live there \u201cfor 20 or 30 more years,\u201d says Ms. Evans.\n\nBut their small master bathroom had turn faucets, a deep, treacherous bathtub, a narrow 24-inch-wide door, and a step-up shower with sliding glass doors.\n\nIn the Evans-Rodgers master bath, the shower has a fold-up seat and grab bar. Photo: Dan Bawden\n\nNot today. The door was expanded 10 inches, and the new vanity is raised, making it gentler on the back. The couple nixed the tub and installed lever faucets. (\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to use,\u201d says Ms. Evans, \u201cand arthritis runs in my family.\u201d) There is also a curbless walk-in shower with a teak fold-up chair.\n\nOh yes, and five grab bars.\n\n\u201cEven though we don\u2019t need them now, we thought, \u2018Why not put them in and be ready?\u2019 \u201d says Ms. Evans, a public-relations consultant. \u201cBrian and I are in good shape and work out five days a week, so I\u2019m amazed at how much I use the grab bars. I don\u2019t want to take the chance of falling.\u201d She finds the grab bar with a hand-held shower head on it \u201ccool.\u201d\n\nIt cost $32,500 to retrofit their bathroom; age-friendly items added just $2,000 to the tab.\n\nNo bending, no tripping\n\nThe four bedrooms in the Owens\u2019s 19th-century home are an 18-step climb from the first floor.\n\n\u201cLife has a way of throwing you curveballs. It\u2019s a pretty big deal if something were to happen now or in 20 years,\u201d says Mr. Owens.\n\nSo the Owens looked around and decided that if they ever need a bedroom on the first floor, it will be their parlor. A full bathroom that\u2019s already nearby makes them golden.\n\nToday, there are no steps anywhere on the first floor and expansive spaces to move about. \u201cAs soon as you walk through the door, you know something is different,\u201d Mr. Owens says.\n\nTo prevent tripping, the rugs and entry mat in the new space are recessed into the hardwood floor. The wood is good for walking and wheelchairs, holds up well, and is easy to maintain. A heated-tile floor, great for cold mornings, is also flush with the hardwood in another area.\n\nKitchen counters have variable heights for sitting (if a person wishes to sit, or if someone is in a wheelchair) and standing. Upper cabinets are few; that helps eliminate heavy lifting, reaching for items, and potentially falling. Drawers and doors underneath the counter close automatically, requiring no hand strength.\n\nRather than bend down to reach plugs, the couple put outlets at least 18 inches off the floor. A keyless entry means one less thing to worry about, too.\n\nAbout one-third of the $170,000 price tag for the addition (which would have run $220,000 if Mr. Owens wasn\u2019t in the building business) was spent on age-friendly features, but guests and family of all ages are benefiting. He points out that his three children, ages 17 to 23, will \u201cespecially appreciate the no-step entry if they blow out their knees skiing!\u201d\n\nMs. Abrahms is a writer in Massachusetts.

Many of these designations hold little meaning, but at least a few may be worth your time.\n\nIn all, there are more than 50 financial designations\u2014typically with \u201csenior\u201d or \u201cretirement\u201d as part of the name\u2014aimed at attracting older adults, according to a 2013 report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Requirements to get the credentials vary widely, from rigorous college-level courses to little more than paying a fee.\n\n\u201cMany are really just marketing tools,\u201d says Stacy Canan, deputy assistant director of the Office for Older Americans at the protection bureau.\n\nKey designations that most investors are familiar with and can benefit from include certified financial planner (CFP) and chartered financial consultant (ChFC). Advisers holdings these titles have extensive training and experience. The following three credentials, while not as comprehensive in scope as those two, may be of interest as a supplementary adviser-screening tool because they focus on an increasingly important topic: how to tap one\u2019s savings in later life.\n\nRetirement income certified professional (RICP): This program\u2014with 1,500 graduates and 6,500 people currently enrolled\u2014is the most popular at the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pa., an educator of CFPs and ChFCs.\n\nThe program consists of three college-level courses that each take 60 to 80 hours to complete and cover 18 subjects, including life and long-term-care insurance, designing portfolios with and without annuities, and Medicare, Social Security and estate planning. Each course ends with a 100-question exam.\n\nCandidates must have at least three years of experience, and graduates must complete 15 hours of continuing education every two years. (To find one of these professionals, go to designationcheck.com.)\n\nRetirement management analyst (RMA): Advisers with at least three years\u2019 experience and a college degree can work toward this designation at a weeklong boot camp at institutions such as Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas. Alternatively, advisers can complete a five-week online training course offered by Boston University, where economists Zvi Bodie and Laurence Kotlikoff contributed to the curriculum.\n\nThe program requires about 120 hours of study, passage of a three-hour exam and 20 hours of continuing education annually. It teaches graduates\u2014there are 115 in all so far\u2014to understand how to manage investment and other types of risk and create a continuing retirement paycheck via sources such as portfolio withdrawals, bond ladders and annuities. (Go to riia-usa.org/consumer/feedback/.)\n\nCertified retirement counselor (CRC): This program includes four courses, one of which focuses on retirement-income planning, both with and without annuities. The courses may be taken online, and students study at their own pace.\n\nThe emphasis is on topics of concern to \u201cthe middle market,\u201d a segment that has savings but \u201cnot so much that they don\u2019t have to be concerned about running out of money,\u201d says Kevin Seibert, managing director of the nonprofit International Foundation for Retirement Education, which created the program with the Center for Financial Responsibility at Texas Tech. Examples include long-term-care planning and tax-efficient withdrawal strategies.\n\nWith 2,000 graduates and 400 enrollees, the program requires college graduates to have at least two years\u2019 experience and those without a degree to have five or more years on the job. It also runs background checks on candidates and requires graduates to complete 15 hours of continuing education annually.

Here are edited excerpts:\n\nWSJ: What are the main issues behind the so-called bubble you see forming in green energy?\n\nMR. WIMMER: Very simply put, for green energy to be truly sustainable, it must be commercially sustainable. The reality today is that when it comes to politicians allocating subsidies, it seems like they are being allocated almost religiously across the board. As long as there is a green element, then [politicians believe] it is fine and deserves funding from tax dollars. I argue that is a little unsophisticated.\n\nWe have got to look at supporting and subsidizing the technologies that stand a chance at becoming commercially independent from subsidies within a reasonable time period\u2014about seven to 10 years. I think that gives us a better bang for the buck than just spraying it across the whole spectrum.\n\nNow one of the arguments that people say against that is, \u201cWhat about innovation? Shouldn\u2019t we try something new from time to time?\u201d I say yes, but I would say those research-and-development dollars are better put into universities, as opposed to a company that gives it a go and then goes bust, the technology lost in the process. It is better to get an education out of it.\n\nWSJ: In your book \u201cThe Green Bubble,\u201d you highlight infrastructure problems involved in large-scale green-energy projects in the U.S. Tell us about those.\n\nMR. WIMMER: There are a number of challenges that green energy faces, and one [involves] infrastructure, meaning that if you were to target, say, 20% green energy including wind farms in the U.S., you would have to build an awful lot of transmission grid, which is quite expensive.\n\nSomebody is going to have to pay for it\u2014the taxpayer, perhaps?\n\nI identify a massive infrastructure challenge, and somebody has to fund that. This is just one of the many challenges that renewables face.\n\nWSJ: What green-investment opportunities might be particularly promising?\n\nMR. WIMMER: One [area of promise] is efficiency technology such as LED lighting that could save you 99% off your consumption compared with a normal lightbulb. That is a huge saving.\n\nAlso, smarthouse grids and big hydro dams, which we love because they operate 24/7, so it is dollars per megawatts, which is actually quite competitive.\n\nThe last big area is nuclear, which is controversial, but if the world is keen to move to a CO2-free arena, nuclear is part of the solution, and you would have to install more nuclear power plants around the world.\n\nMiss Akhtar is a writer in London.

Widely used since now-retired financial planner Bill Bengen published groundbreaking research on safe withdrawal rates in 1994, the 4% rule calls for retirees to spend no more than 4% from their portfolios in the first year of retirement\u2014and then adjust that amount annually to keep up with inflation.\n\nFor someone with a $1 million portfolio, the formula produces an initial income of $40,000 and\u2014assuming inflation of 2.5%\u2014an increase to $41,000 in year two.\n\nIn contrast with that relatively rigid approach, a dynamic strategy takes into account how financial markets\u2014and, as a consequence, retirees\u2019 nest eggs\u2014perform from year to year. Annual withdrawals may be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThose adjustments, according to financial advisers, give dynamic withdrawal strategies two advantages over the 4% rule. First they allow for a larger withdrawal rate at the start of retirement, when people generally are most active, says Michael Finke, a professor of personal financial planning at Texas Tech University.\n\nOf course, spending more at the outset of retirement can be risky. But many dynamic strategies set their initial withdrawal at about 5%. That\u2019s well below 6.5%, the median 30-year withdrawal rate retirees could have used without going bust since the late 19th century, says Michael Kitces, director of planning research at Pinnacle Advisory Group Inc. in Columbia, Md. (\u201cMedian,\u201d meaning a withdrawal rate of 6.5% would have been successful half the time.)\n\nSince 4% is the withdrawal rate that \u201cwould have worked if you had retired during a historic catastrophe\u201d such as the Great Depression, \u201cif you start at 5%, there\u2019s a decent chance you won\u2019t ever have to make spending cuts,\u201d Mr. Kitces adds.\n\nThe second advantage: Dynamic approaches, say a growing number of advisers and academics, can help retirees better manage the risks associated with an extended bear market.\n\n\u201cWe have an unusual situation where stock prices are almost double their historic average valuations and bond yields after inflation are basically nothing. There\u2019s almost no way returns on portfolios in the future are going to be what they were in the past,\u201d Prof Finke says. In contrast to the 4% rule, strategies that call for reduced spending when times get tough \u201ccan significantly increase the sustainability of a retirement portfolio.\u201d\n\nWhat follows are three dynamic withdrawal strategies. Which works best for you will depend on factors such as your tolerance for risk and complexity, your desire to leave something for heirs and your willingness to cut spending if need be.\n\nThe 4% rule, adjusted\n\nWorried about withdrawing an inflation-adjusted 4% from your portfolio amid a market crash? Baltimore-based mutual-fund company T. Rowe Price Group Inc. recommends forgoing inflation adjustments following any year in which your portfolio loses value. Assuming you hold 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds, that means you can withdraw 5% to start and still have a 90% chance\u2014based on historical experience\u2014of not running out of money over 30 years.\n\nPros: Relatively easy to administer, this approach produces a more predictable income stream than many other dynamic strategies.\n\nCons: While your nominal income may remain steady, your inflation-adjusted income is likely to decline over time. Moreover, if your portfolio generates average to above-average returns over your retirement, your heirs will pocket much of the upside, says Wade Pfau, a professor at the American College of Financial Services and a principal at McLean Asset Management Corp.\n\nFloor-and-ceiling rule\n\nMany financial advisers, including Mr. Bengen, have devised variations of this approach.\n\nIf your portfolio rises in value during the year, your withdrawal in the following year will rise, too\u2014but no higher than a well-defined \u201cceiling.\u201d Conversely, if your portfolio falls in value, your withdrawal will also decline, but no lower than a set \u201cfloor.\u201d (See the example in the accompanying chart.)\n\nThe goal, says Colleen Jaconetti, a Vanguard Group senior investment analyst, is to \u201cuse good years to give yourself a little bit of a raise but reinvest any excess\u201d so you\u2019ll have a cushion for down years.\n\nPros: Changes in income may be frequent, but relatively small.\n\nCons: The math requires a few steps\u2014and your inflation-adjusted spending may decline over time.\n\nThe guardrail rule\n\nIn contrast to the floor-and-ceiling approach, this strategy is likely to produce fewer adjustments to income. But, when adjustments are needed, the income swings are typically larger.\n\nLet\u2019s say that you retire with $1 million and withdraw 5%, or $50,000, in year one. If your balance changes by year-end, you must recalculate your withdrawal rate. Assuming your portfolio declines 20% to $800,000, your $50,000 withdrawal\u2014plus an annual adjustment for inflation\u2014now represents more than 6% of your new $800,000 balance.\n\nAny time your withdrawal rate rises above 6%, the rule imposes a 10% pay cut for the next year, says Mr. Guyton, co-architect of the method along with William Klinger, a software developer and educator in New Jersey. As a result, after adjusting the $50,000 initial withdrawal for inflation\u2014to $51,000, assuming a 2% inflation rate\u2014the method imposes a 10% pay cut, of $5,100, to produce a $45,900 withdrawal in year two.\n\nThe good news: You can give yourself a 10% raise following years in which your withdrawal rate falls below 4%\u2014as would happen when withdrawing $50,000 from a $1 million portfolio that appreciates by more than 25% to over $1.25 million.\n\nIn years in which your withdrawal rate is between 4% and 6%, simply adjust your most recent withdrawal\u2014$50,000 in this example\u2014to keep up with inflation. (Skip the inflation adjustment following a year in which your portfolio sustains a loss.)\n\nPros: Mr. Guyton puts the odds of running out of money using such an approach at close to zero. And if your portfolio does well, your income is likely to grow considerably, says Mr. Pfau.\n\nCons: In a prolonged bear market, you might face consecutive 10% annual cuts.\n\nMs. Tergesen is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Photo: AFP/Getty Images\n\nA new push is on to get more adults vaccinated against devastating diseases like pneumonia, shingles and whooping cough.\n\nPublic-health officials and infectious-disease experts are working with physicians, health plans and drugstore chains to better educate adults about what shots they need\u2014and make sure they follow up. State health departments are expanding the use of registries to better document patient vaccine records, and using strategies such as \u201cstanding orders\u201d that authorize nurses and pharmacists to administer recommended vaccines without a doctor\u2019s exam or prescription.\n\nBehind the effort is rising concern about the immunization status of the aging baby-boom population. While there has been more progress with geriatric patients, just over 45% of adults 50-64 were vaccinated against influenza in the 2012-13 seasons. And for six important nonflu vaccines, adult rates \u201care dismally low,\u201d says David Kim, deputy associate director for adult immunization at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\u201cCollectively as a health-care system, we need to get the word out to health-care providers to talk about vaccines with their adult patients,\u201d Dr. Kim says.\n\nDouble threat\n\nWith the recent focus on the dangers of failing to vaccinate children, experts say, unvaccinated adults may not realize that not only are they at risk themselves, but they also pose a risk of passing diseases on to the young, the frail and the elderly. For example, adults are the most common source of whooping-cough infection in infants, who are at high risk of serious complications and death.\n\nYet fewer than 18% of adults ages 19 to 64 have received a Tdap vaccine in the past eight years to provide protection from tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, the formal name for whooping cough. And less than 22% of adults in the same age bracket who are considered at high risk have received one of two pneumococcal vaccines to protect against the bacteria that causes pneumonia, ear and sinus infections, and can invade the bloodstream.\n\nThe picture isn\u2019t much better for the shingles vaccination; only one in four adults over 60, the age at which the shot is recommended, have received the vaccine. The same virus that causes chickenpox can remain dormant in the body for years and reactivate to cause the painful, blistering condition. About one in three Americans will develop shingles, also known as zoster, in their lifetime, and it can recur. Moreover it can cause serious complications in the eye and lead to an excruciatingly painful aftereffect known as post-herpetic neuralgia, which may last for years and interfere with quality of life.\n\nOf course, vaccines aren\u2019t 100% effective. But even if they don\u2019t ward off an illness entirely, they can reduce both its intensity and the risk of long-term complications.\n\n\u201cThe message isn\u2019t just about preventing the disease but preventing the severity of the symptoms,\u201d says Litjen Tan, chief strategy officer of the nonprofit Immunization Action Coalition, and co-chairman of a national adult-immunization summit that includes public-health officials and vaccine makers.\n\nOne reason for the scant progress in recent years is that doctors were reluctant to stock vaccines for which they might not be fully reimbursed and patients resisted paying anything out of pocket, Dr. Tan says. But the Affordable Care Act requires health plans to cover all vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP, with no copays.\n\nIn addition, the National Vaccine Advisory Committee, which sets standards for implementing the recommendations, in 2013 called on all health-care professionals\u2014whether they provide vaccinations or not\u2014to take steps to ensure their adult patients are fully immunized. The CDC\u2019s Dr. Kim says doctors should ask about vaccines at appointments just as they collect information about current medications and allergies and take blood-pressure and weight readings.\n\nRevised recommendations\n\nThe most recent adult vaccine schedule, released in February, had one major change, for the first time recommending that adults over 65 get two different vaccines\u2014PCV13 and PPSV23\u2014to protect against pneumonia and related infections, because each protects against different types of bacteria and works in different ways, offering broader protection.\n\nThe schedule also provides guidance on issues adults should discuss with their health-care provider, such as the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella. Adults born in 1957 or later who don\u2019t have a record of being vaccinated or having had the diseases should talk to their doctor about how many doses they may need, especially with measles on the rise.\n\nDr. Tan, for example, says he wasn\u2019t vaccinated as a child growing up in Singapore and got the MMR vaccine when he came to the U.S. for college. When his family was preparing to vacation in France during an outbreak there, he had everyone get a booster. Even if patients aren\u2019t sure about their history, repeat vaccines are safe, he says.\n\nPatients can also ask their doctor to do blood tests to see if they are immune to certain vaccine-preventable diseases, and ask if there are any potential risks to vaccines, such as an allergic reaction to any components.\n\nThe CDC website has an easy-to-read consumer version of the vaccination schedule (adapted in the accompanying chart), which also includes immunizations for two types of hepatitis and meningitis. Still, with so many immunizations and footnotes, \u201cit can be complicated territory to figure out,\u201d says Ann Marie Pettis, a nurse who is a member of the APIC board and director of infection prevention at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.\n\nPharmacists\u2019 role\n\nPharmacists can be very helpful in explaining the schedule to customers, Ms. Pettis says, and are already administering annual flu shots to many of them.\n\nWalgreens provides adult vaccines in its drugstores, and last year the chain introduced an immunization feature for its mobile app that allows patients to store their immunization history and email it to their doctors. The app also provides personalized immunization recommendations based on age and medical history and can send reminders when a vaccine is due, along with information about the disease it is meant to prevent.\n\nWalgreens encourages its pharmacists to talk to patients about their vaccinations when they are in for other matters, like filling a prescription. \u201cFor many patients we may be the only health-care professional they come in contact with,\u201d says Nimesh Jhaveri, divisional vice president.\n\nMs. Landro is an assistant managing editor for The Wall Street Journal in New York and writes the Informed Patient column.

Send us your suggestions at next@wsj.com.\n\nMy partner, John, and I first visited the P\u00e9rigord region in southwest France in 2006, spending New Year's at a friend's medieval castle. We had both traveled through France when we were young\u2014John on a motorcycle in his 20s, I as a 16-year-old exchange student. Returning together in our 60s as a new couple was romantic. The long weekend in the castle was magical.\n\nSpending Time in France's P\u00e9rigord Region\n\nWe spent evenings around a fire, drinking local wines and discussing the culture and history of the P\u00e9rigord, famous for prehistoric cave paintings and Romanesque architecture. During the day we explored gray-green valleys and ridge-top medieval villages. Our friend's castle dated to the 13th century, and every room was steeped in the past\u2014a mantel covered with photos, hair ornaments and books with pages marked by ribbons; a rack of straw hats above a wire basket of walking sticks. We were enchanted with it all.\n\nToday we live in the P\u00e9rigord full time, a decision we made slowly. For three years we visited often and began to wonder what it would be like to leave our apartment in New York and move to France. We started looking at\u2014and falling in love with\u2014one charming ruin after another: a 12th-century farm with stone buildings clustered on a hillside, and no electricity, plumbing or central heat; another with stables and breathtaking views, but no amenities\u2014not even a passable road.\n\nA Small Farm\n\nOn a rainy morning in November 2008, our real-estate agent took us to a small farm near St.-Avit-S\u00e9nieur. The house featured light ocher limestone and a steep roof of mossy tiles. It sat high on a bank above a 12th-century pilgrimage route to Compostela in Spain.\n\n30 Great Places to Retire:\n\nA Journal E-Book Read 30 of Next's most exciting profiles of retirement destinations across the U.S. and overseas, complete with photos and quick facts for easy comparisons. The e-book, which can be viewed on all devices, is available for $3.99 at WSJ.com/eRetire , or on Amazon Kindle, Apple's iBooks or Barnes & Noble's NOOK Book Store.\n\nAcross the courtyard from the house was an imposing 100-foot barn, big enough for studios for John, a guest apartment, and a writing room for me. The owner was the mayor of a neighboring village. He was an elegant man, and when he met us, he bowed slightly and said, \"Enchant\u00e9.\" We made an offer of \u20ac200,000 (about $254,000 at the time), and he accepted.\n\nMost of our first year was devoted to renovating our new home, a task we have in common with any number of expats. First we opened up the kitchen fireplace that had been built over with cabinets, uncovering a lovely limestone hearth. The mayor told us that his wife's grandparents used to sit inside the fireplace in the winter. I could see them\u2014cozy, rosy-cheeked and smiling. But when we tried to build a fire on a cold and wet afternoon, we were quickly disabused of our romanticism; there was more smoke in the kitchen than there was going up the chimney.\n\nOpen Space\n\nWe solved our biggest problem when friends from Paris visited us on Easter weekend. Patrick is an architect, and we had long admired the light-filled, airy apartment he designed for his family. Patrick walked the house and showed us how removing a few walls would give us a long sweep of southwest windows. His solution was brilliant. The house was too dark, and eight small, low-ceilinged rooms became two open, luminous spaces: one for living, cooking and eating; the other for work, reading and sleeping.\n\nReplicas of prehistoric cave paintings from the Lascaux II cave. Semitour\n\nA living-room fireplace that we wanted to construct out of massive limestone blocks became a lesson about life and commerce in rural France. Our resourceful contractor, Dale, invited members of a local soccer team to help us. On a December morning, six strong, red-faced, groaning, staggering men (\"\u00c0 gauche, non, non, \u00e0 droite\"\u2014\"To the left, no, no, to the right\") shouldered the stones into place. Afterward they beamed; we toasted each other with Armagnac (P\u00e9rigordian brandy), but they refused to take any pay. We took them to lunch\u2014five grand courses and many bottles of wine. The memorable meal cost more than the new fireplace.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\nWith the renovation completed, our life in France officially commenced. Now, almost three years later, we take weekly French lessons. We go to one bakery for bread and another for croissants. We shop at farmers' markets for fresh eggs, cheese and garden vegetables. Our neighborhood cafe welcomes us on winter evenings at the zinc bar, and on starry summer nights on the terrace on the square, which we share with tourists as the weather warms.\n\nP\u00e9rigord villages depend on tourism, and from June to September the roads are clogged with caravans and cars; visitors throng the squares, churches and castles. There is an event every evening in nearby villages: a night market with live music in Beaumont where we eat and dance; a Bach cantata performed in a 12th-century abbey in Cadouin; jazz saxophone on the square in Moli\u00e8res.\n\nBut it is the local people who mean so much to us. Our neighbors' generosity eased our way: gregarious Bertrand, a former stonemason who reads Socrates and plays jazz piano, and his warm, lovely wife, Mathilda. No question is ever too complicated or ill-timed for them.\n\nThe market town of Sarlat. Sarlat Office of Tourism\n\nOur home is full of friends from around the world; we share big meals and talk long into the night. As an artist, John has fared well with the publication of a bilingual book and an exhibition of his sculptures at an 11th-century castle keep. I have honed my writing (I once worked as a public-relations director) in my room in the barn with a view of flower-filled fields.\n\nBureaucratic Roulette\n\nThat's not to say there aren't problems. The French bureaucracy is every bit as bad as its reputation. Moving here, John got a three-year renewable visa for artists, which allows him to work in France. I received a one-year visa that requires me to reapply each year for a residency card, the qualifications and regulations for which change just as often. After I fulfill the endless list of supporting documents, I make two three-hour round trips to the state capital. One year the office was closed even after I called ahead. \"Aujourd'hui est exceptionnel,\" I was told. \"Today is exceptional.\" Humor helps us keep our perspective.\n\nThe weak dollar has eroded some of our buying power, but we feel the quality of life in France more than compensates. Our living expenses\u2014for food, utilities, property and local taxes\u2014are still less than they were in New York. And some things cost far less. Health care, for instance. Until we qualified for the national health system, I paid \u20ac23 ($29) for a doctor's visit with no insurance. Now we pay a small percentage of our income, which covers most of the cost of office visits, prescriptions and hospitalization. Cultural events are generally free or less than \u20ac15 ($19). The biggest expense is visiting the U.S. once or twice a year. We miss our family and friends but love having them in our guest apartment during summer months.\n\nThere are times I wonder what the future will bring when we are really old, and whether we will stay here forever. Right now, our life is just right, and we are grateful to live in such a wonderful part of the world.\n\nMs. Dawson is a writer living in France.

Photo: Getty Images\n\nThis is part of a series in which Americans age 50-plus profile their adopted overseas locales. Send us your suggestions at encore@wsj.com.\n\nOur decision to settle in Amsterdam was something of an accident. One that has turned out rather well.\n\nAfter accepting an expat assignment for Verizon in Milan in 2000 and taking early retirement in 2007, we began looking for a new home. July 2009 found us in Amsterdam as part of a house trade with a Dutch couple.\n\nWhile in Amsterdam, we received a good offer on our house south of Milan. The buyer wanted a quick sale; rather than rush back and start looking for another place to live in Italy, we decided simply to remain in Amsterdam.\n\nIt has that effect on people.\n\nAmsterdam is among the most agreeable destinations in Europe, one that offers extensive cultural and recreational opportunities.\n\nA City on Wheels\n\nThe city is quite small for a European capital, with only about 800,000 residents. The many parks are immaculately tended, with that special Dutch dedication to flowers. One of the best airports on the continent is a 10-minute ride from our front door. And the Dutch people are generally open and friendly\u2014and unusually direct. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d, \u201cHow much do you make?\u201d and \u201cWhat do you pay for rent?\u201d are considered normal questions.\n\nThe downsides? Amsterdam is not what most would consider a lower-cost retirement option. Rents can be steep, about $1,500 to $2,000 a month for a two-bedroom apartment in the pleasant parts of town, and electric and gas rates are among the highest in Europe.\n\nThe weather, too, can be problematic. As the local greenery indicates, it rains a lot here: every month of the year and, from October until April, almost every day, although showers typically clear up as fast as they arrive. Think Portland, Ore., and Seattle without the mountains.\n\nWe live in a relatively spacious (1,000 square feet) two-bedroom apartment in Rivierenbuurt, the \u201criver neighborhood,\u201d about 2 miles south of the center of Amsterdam. There is a major cross street a block away with many shops and restaurants. The area is relatively quiet. Just about everything we need\u2014the market, a hardware store, postal service, doctor, dentist\u2014is a short walk or bike ride away. We are two blocks from the nearest canal, one of hundreds in the city.\n\nAnd speaking of bikes\u2026visitors will immediately be stunned at the sheer number of people riding bicycles: businessmen in suits, mothers with several children on multiseat or cargo bikes, workers and tradesmen towing seemingly impossible shapes and weights, pregnant women, as well as young and old couples riding while holding hands. All this regardless of the weather.\n\nIndeed, the relative ease and efficiency of doing most things by bike prompted us to sell our car a year after we arrived; we simply weren\u2019t using it enough to justify the high costs of having a vehicle in the city.\n\nWork and Play\n\nOur days are a mix of work and leisure. Louie, 59 years old, teaches business economics twice a week at Utrecht University, about 30 minutes from home. Laura, 57, has developed a network of pet-care services (many expat families have brought along the family dog) and is involved in the American Women\u2019s Club of Amsterdam, a social and volunteer group.\n\nWeekend activities are highly season-dependent. Spring and summer offer weather mild enough to pursue lengthy bike rides, up to 60 miles or so, as well as visits to parks, markets, open-air concerts and fairs. The diminished daylight and lower temperatures in winter are mostly conducive to indoor activities, museum and library visits. An annual admission card costing about \u20ac50 (about $58) provides access to the majority of museums and other cultural venues.\n\nActive and Fit\n\nThe opportunities and locations for exercise are numerous, and we have noticed that the Dutch are a seriously active and generally fit people. We both think that our physical condition would be worse were it not for the overall Dutch disdain for a sedentary lifestyle.\n\nPerhaps the most positive aspect of being an American here is the universal use of English; the country is essentially bilingual. We have hardly ever come across a local who isn\u2019t well versed in the language; thus, an expat here will have an easier time interacting with the authorities as well as service providers. The downside: After years of effort, our Dutch is as bad as ever!\n\nWe mentioned the authorities. Most people here trust and respect the police, who are more Andy Griffith than Dirty Harry. You might be riding your bike home (very) late, perhaps after some imbibing; it is not uncommon for an officer, who is likely also on a bicycle, to stop you, but only to warn you that your headlight is not on!\n\nThat approach, along with an apparent overall Dutch attitude that it is better to behave yourself than escalate an issue with law enforcement, results in a very safe environment.\n\nAn unofficial estimate from the U.S. consulate puts the number of Americans living in the Netherlands at about 40,000. Most are in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague. We have met many Americans who have been here for well over 10 years. There are also a significant number of British expats.\n\nWe do have a number of Dutch friends; however, most of them are the significant others of Americans or other expats.\n\nAs partial retirees, we are very sensitive to health-care costs and issues. While we retain retirement benefits from Louie\u2019s former U.S. employer, those tend to be less generous if applied to an out-of-network provider, as all foreign doctors would be. We also cannot qualify for Medicare coverage living outside the U.S. That seems nonsensical, as the costs of most medical procedures here are drastically less than the same ones performed stateside. An MRI here costs about \u20ac250; lab tests are generally less than \u20ac10.\n\nWe also have the mandatory Dutch medical coverage. The Netherlands doesn\u2019t provide free universal care, as many might expect. Private insurance companies must provide a level of basic care for a minimum payment of \u20ac720 per person per year, with a \u20ac365 deductible. There is a small copayment for most items, but we can go wherever we choose for care.\n\nWhere to Next?\n\nWill we return to the U.S.? That\u2019s up in the air. Although our \u201cport of exit\u201d was Dallas, we have no ties there. Laura has an affinity for New York, while Louie would now consider only a bike-friendly environment such as Portland or Washington.\n\nFortunately, traveling from Amsterdam is very convenient. High-speed trains reach Paris in less than three hours, Brussels in two. Several low-cost airlines serving Amsterdam provide frequent service to almost all major points in Europe.\n\nWe try to visit at least two new destinations a year, usually places that we had heard of at some earlier point in life (and now realize that they actually exist!). Most recently, we traveled to Malta and the Baltic countries. We tend to enjoy places that appear to be going through a transition.\n\nOverall, we have a good life.\n\nThe Pinnas can be reached at encore@wsj.com.", "date": null, "title": "Best Places to Retire Abroad: Amsterdam"}

Photo: Mike Schramm\n\nYou\u2019re going to do what? And where? That was the general reaction of friends and family when my wife, Kristin, and I said we were building a house in southern Chile.\n\nToday, our redwood cabin sits on 2\u00bd acres in the Andes mountains. We spend four to six months there every year. How we reached this point is a story of good fortune, hard work\u2014and why it helps to have friends who own a bed-and-breakfast.\n\nBefore retiring in 2012, I spent 34 years at Owens Corning, the building-products maker. For 18 of those years, my family and I lived and worked outside the U.S., in Saudi Arabia, Chile and Mexico. For retirement, Kristin and I wanted to continue to travel and live part of the year outside the U.S.\n\nChile was our favorite foreign assignment. We love the people and the natural beauty. At one point, we befriended a couple who ran a bed-and-breakfast in Villarrica, Chile. They kept a list of would-be expats who were interested in buying land in the area, and we added our names to the list.\n\nIn 2005, our friends learned of a piece of property coming on the market: 1,500 acres of virgin forest, about 5 miles from the Argentine border. Within 30 days, nine families\u2014from Canada, Ireland and the U.S.\u2014joined to buy the site. A small piece of Chile was ours.\n\nOff the grid\n\nIn the years since, Kristin and I have begun creating a life for ourselves in our adopted home. The benefits are numerous: stunning scenery, unlimited outdoor activities, a low cost of living and a nearby village whose residents have embraced us. Chile as a whole has a stable economy and strong rule of law, with low crime rates and little corruption by Latin American standards.\n\nOf course, this destination\u2014and our off-the-grid lifestyle\u2014isn\u2019t for everyone. The nearest hospital is almost a two-hour drive from our home. And winter snows close the roads in the area.\n\nStill, Kristin and I\u2014married for 41 years and in our mid-60s\u2014relish the adventure.\n\nWe typically arrive in December, the beginning of summer in South America, and stay through April. (From May through November, we live in Albuquerque, N.M.) We fly into Santiago and drive about nine hours to Quililche, the local name for our land. Elevation: about 3,500 feet. The weather is pleasant most days we\u2019re here, with highs around 80 degrees and lows in the 40s and 50s\u2014all with low humidity and very few bugs.\n\nAbout 40 acres of the original 1,500 have been set aside for homes and common buildings. Our ownership group has decided to keep the balance of the property in its natural state, while permitting the development of trails for hiking and mountain biking. The tract is bordered by two national parks, has a lake on each side, and is dense with 1,000-year-old Araucarias, Chile\u2019s national tree. Sometimes in the forest we feel like we\u2019re in \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201d\n\nOur house is comfortable (we imported most of the materials and fixtures from the U.S.), but the remote setting involves a few adjustments. We use propane for our Amish-made refrigerator, lamps, stove and on-demand hot-water heater. A 35-gallon tank (cost: $70) lasts us a month. We use a generator for the washing machine and to pump water from a spring. And we recently added a small solar-power unit for recharging laptops, tablets and phones.\n\nMost of our days start at sunrise. Meal planning is always high on our to-do list. There are frequent communal lunches and dinners with other owners. We have a greenhouse and buy additional vegetables and eggs from our neighbors. Many of the raspberries, peaches, blueberries, cherries, avocados, etc., sold in the U.S. from December through March are grown in Chile.\n\nWe entertain ourselves, taking advantage of hiking, mountain biking and exploring. Natural hot springs are 30 minutes away. It is always amazing to see birds that are unafraid of people. We enjoy reading (Kristin is never far from her Kindle) and board games.\n\nVillage doings\n\nThe closest village, 8 miles away, has about 300 people. It is a reflection of Chile itself: inviting and unpretentious. We often share meals in each other\u2019s homes. (Kristin is fluent and I am proficient in Spanish.) We are welcomed at their rodeos\u2014a popular form of entertainment\u2014and they appreciate the employment that our homeowners\u2019 group occasionally provides.\n\nThe nearest city for shopping, building materials, restaurants and a hospital is Puc\u00f3n, almost two hours from our home. We visit weekly to have a restaurant meal, access the Internet, and download newspapers and magazines.\n\nThe hospital in Puc\u00f3n is full service, with little time spent in the waiting room. Two years ago, I severely burned my foot with boiling water. The doctor treated and dressed the injury and had me out the door in less than 45 minutes. Cost: $40. Health care in Chile is excellent.\n\nSpeaking of bills\u2026we can get by on less than $800 a month. (Our house and vehicle are paid for.) Our homeowner fees are $100 a month and cover taxes, maintenance of the common buildings, insurance and the salary of a caretaker, who lives in the nearby village.\n\nAs for downsides: Mother Nature plays the occasional trick. In April, we woke up one morning to a hazy sky and a quarter-inch of ash on our truck. By noon it was pitch black. The source: an eruption at the Calbuco volcano, 200 miles south of us. By evening the sky had cleared.\n\nYes, isolation can be an issue. But then, solitude can be wonderful. We cherish the quiet, the complete darkness in our home. As there is no light pollution in our area, the night skies are a revelation. We are fortunate to have frequent visits from family and friends.\n\nWhat lies ahead? Our home is complete, but there is still much to do on trail building, landscaping, etc. In April, we planted fruit trees, Chilean cedar trees, other hardwoods and Sequoia redwoods.\n\nAnd there could be good news on the amenities front. In May, as we were departing, we learned that a private company is installing a mini hydroelectric plant in a river close to our property. In addition, two private mobile-phone companies have installed cell towers within 10 miles of us. This means we could have access to electricity, cell service and the Internet before year-end.\n\nHow important would that be? Just after we returned to the U.S. this year, I asked Kristin what she enjoyed most about being back on the grid.

Photo: Bob O'Connor for The Wall Street Journal\n\nWhen he hit 50, Tim Carrigan \u2019s lower back started hurting so badly he could barely walk.\n\nThe injury, which dated to a childhood accident, had caused only occasional pain until Mr. Carrigan lost muscle tone with age. The pain dogged him for several years, but last year the Quincy, Mass., insurance-company treasurer started strength training twice a week on a circuit of a dozen machines.\n\nNot only did his back improve, \u201cI feel better. I feel stronger. I sleep better,\u201d says Mr. Carrigan, now 54. He adds that his stronger back has held up while shoveling during Boston\u2019s historic snowstorms.\n\nWhile old-school wisdom held that older adults were too frail to pump iron, a growing body of research is showing that strength training helps stave off age-related disability, preserve bone mass in women and even boost brainpower.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s way more dangerous to not be active as an older adult,\u201d says Miriam Nelson, professor of nutrition at Tufts University\u2019s Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy in Boston.\n\nBrain fuel\n\nResearch at Tufts and around the country is finding that it\u2019s safe for older adults to train intensely; when they do, they gain significant muscle mass\u2014albeit not as efficiently as a younger person. A healthy person in his or her 60s can gain 2 to 3 pounds of muscle in six months to a year, about half of the gains that a younger person would see with the same workouts, says Roger A. Fielding, a Tufts University School of Medicine professor. Injuries are rare, he adds.\n\nThe benefits appear to be complementary to aerobic exercise. While cardiovascular workouts aid in memory tasks, such as the ability to repeat back a list of words, strength training has been found to boost \u201cexecutive function,\u201d or higher-level brain tasks, says Teresa Liu-Ambrose, associate professor in the department of physical therapy at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. Executive function is what allows \u201ca highly capable person to juggle multiple tasks and follow them through to the end,\u201d she says.\n\nA common challenge facing older adults who are starting weight training is pre-existing injuries, such as chronic back or shoulder pain, says Wayne L. Westcott, an instructor of exercise science at Quincy College in Quincy, Mass., which runs a health and fitness center open to the public for an annual fee.\n\nIf you\u2019re injured before beginning workouts, consult with a trainer, who can give you tips, such as how to modify exercises to take pressure off a weak shoulder, Dr. Westcott says.\n\nAnother roadblock for the 50-plus crowd is that they often don\u2019t get enough protein, scientists say. Caroline Apovian, director of the Nutrition and Weight Management Center at Boston Medical Center, recommends that all older adults, particularly those who are strength training, ingest 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, spread throughout the day. (Take two-thirds of your weight in pounds, and the resulting number is roughly how many grams of protein a day Dr. Apovian recommends.)\n\nQuality of life\n\nThe good news: Even though older individuals gain muscle less rapidly than their younger peers, the fact that they are starting from a weaker base means the relative gains are larger, resulting in significant differences in quality of life, researchers say.\n\nThis was the case for Elaine Denniston, a 75-year-old retired lawyer from Dorchester, Mass., who thought she hated exercise until she started a class at Kit Clarke Senior Services, a center in her neighborhood that offers exercise classes developed by Tufts scientists. She persevered, motivated by the friendly social atmosphere in the class, and says that, thanks to leg-strengthening exercises, she has been able to ditch the elastic ankle supports she had been wearing for arthritis.\n\nRetired thoracic surgeon Benedict Daly, 75, began strength training three years ago after spinal pain\u2014a consequence of years hunched over patients in the operating room\u2014made it painful to walk more than a block or two. Within about six months of starting the training, he was playing nine holes of golf twice a week, and he walked 6 miles a day last summer while exploring Venice.\n\nWatch your form\n\nTo get the most out of his workout, he relied heavily on trainers at Quincy College, who gave tips on form, such as keeping his shoulders firmly on the bench while doing chest presses. \u201cThey watch you like a hawk,\u201d he says.\n\nFor many, the first and most difficult step in strength training is making the time commitment. Dorothy Bardin, 75, of New York works part time in a clothing store and trains for a marathon three times a week. She squeezes in two short strength-training workouts a week, but hasn\u2019t yet started a more rigorous program recommended by her sports-medicine physician.\n\n\u201cI never gave it a fair try\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe I should\u2014starting tomorrow.\u201d\n\nMiss Johannes is a writer in Boston.

People are living longer\u2014sometimes a lot longer\u2014at a time when their ability to comfortably support themselves has never seemed more at risk.\n\nSo the big question for retirees, or for those about to retire, is a simple one: How do you make sure your savings last as long as you do?\n\nTwo familiar strategies have pushed to the front of ideas about how to secure a steady and lasting stream of income in retirement, a stream that ideally would even grow. One is known as total-return investing, or balancing your investment allocations in a traditionally diversified portfolio\u2014seeking income but also asset appreciation. That approach, its advocates say, in the long run reduces a retiree\u2019s exposure to market volatility and risk.\n\nThe other approach is income investing, a strategy that focuses on stable, income-producing investments\u2014such as bonds and equities with healthy dividends\u2014and places less emphasis on asset appreciation and capital gains.\n\nWhat follows are the arguments in favor of each of those approaches.\n\nMaking the case for total return is Barry H. Kaplan, chief investment officer of Cambridge Wealth Counsel in Atlanta. Arguing for income investing is Charles Farrell, chief executive officer of Northstar Investment Advisors in Denver.\n\nA Total-Return Strategy Is Simple, Dependable and Tax-Efficient\n\nBy Barry H. Kaplan\n\nAn optimal \u201cdrawdown\u201d strategy must produce a dependable income and be simple enough for the average retiree to follow without error.\n\nGiven that, I favor a total-return strategy. Most academics and well-respected mutual-fund families, including Vanguard and Fidelity, support this view.\n\nUsing a total-return approach, a retiree maintains a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds and cash in allocations suitable to his or her risk tolerance and time horizon. I favor using passive mutual-funds that approximate broad market indexes. Such investments keep costs down, minimize taxes, lower volatility and decrease risk.\n\nThe total-return strategy isn\u2019t restricted to chasing income or price appreciation; it\u2019s agnostic as to whether returns come from dividends, interest or capital appreciation. A total-return portfolio can diversify across every asset class, whether or not it writes you a dividend or interest check.\n\nFor instance, assume a couple in their mid-60s retires with $1 million. They could start with $100,000 in cash, $450,000 in globally diversified equities and $450,000 in a diversified bond portfolio. At its simplest, two funds alone could suffice: the Vanguard Total World Stock Market Index and the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index.\n\nBucket brigades\n\nAs the cash is used to pay bills, the couple replenishes that \u201cbucket\u201d by selling assets that have increased in value. (That forces the pair to \u201csell high.\u201d) If stocks, for instance, were targeted to be 45% of the portfolio and have grown to 50%, the retirees sell stocks to raise money.\n\nSelling assets is where many investors who are conditioned never to invade principal balk. Many believe, by contrast, that payouts in the form of dividends and interest don\u2019t invade principal. But, in fact, they do. It\u2019s just the company instead of the retiree that\u2019s doing the invading.\n\nWhen a company generates profits, it typically can do three things with the money: reinvest in its business, buy back shares or pay a dividend. . If it decides to pay a dividend, the exchange on which its shares are traded typically will lower the share price by an amount equal to the dividend. (This occurs after the close of the market on the last business day before new buyers of the shares no longer qualify to receive that dividend.) Thus, anytime you own a stock that pays dividends, your principal is being invaded. A dividend isn\u2019t free.\n\nWe also must consider taxes. All of a dividend\u2019s distribution is taxable; in a sale of assets, only the difference between the cost basis and the sale price is taxed. This makes total-return more tax-efficient than the income approach.\n\nOf course, a total-return strategy can\u2019t eliminate market risk. Early in retirement, in particular, people need to keep at least two to three years\u2019 worth of spending needs in a money-market fund or similar investment. This way you insulate yourself from bear markets in the first several years of retirement, which statistically pose the biggest threat to your financial future.\n\nSpeaking of downturns, dividends aren\u2019t necessarily the best place to hide. In 2008, global equities fell almost 40%. A year later, 57% of all dividend-paying stocks cut or eliminated payouts. We all know retirees whose pre-2008 portfolios were stuffed with \u201csafe\u201d stocks like Washington Mutual, Wachovia, Citigroup, SunTrust, General Electric, etc. Many lifestyles were downsized when nest eggs filled with dividend stocks crumpled.\n\nIt\u2019s true, dividend yields grew from 2000 to 2012 while the S&P 500 did not. But that\u2019s just one period. In the years preceding the dot-com crash, dividends were out of favor with many companies, which casts doubt on 2000 as a historically representative starting point. In addition, in the prior decade, dividend yields fell while stocks ran up.\n\nTyranny of studies\n\nThere will always be studies that look at data in certain ways to make isolated points, like the one from Ibbotson Associates which calculated that $1 invested in the stock market in 1926 would have grown to more than $4,600 by 2013 with dividends reinvested, but only about $145 without dividends. Another way to look at this is that on price return alone, the investment grew 145 times, but receiving and reinvesting dividends increased it by only 31 times from there.\n\nIn short, I\u2019m not saying that dividends aren't important. But it\u2019s the total-return strategy itself that gives retirees more ways to generate income. Retirees can have a more diversified, lower-risk portfolio, keep more of their returns after tax, and have portfolios that last longer into retirement using a total-return approach.\n\nMr. Kaplan is chief investment officer of Cambridge Wealth Counsel in Atlanta. He can be reached at encore@wsj.com.\n\nA Focus on Income and Dividends Is Safer in the Long Run\n\nBy Charles Farrell\n\nThere\u2019s a rule of thumb that says retirees have a good chance of making their savings last their whole lives if they withdraw only 4% of their nest egg each year. The remaining assets, according to this theory, have to return only 4% a year (adjusted for inflation) to replace what is being spent.\n\nSounds like that should be easy to achieve, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nBut it isn\u2019t. This theory can fall apart when markets have an extended run of bad years. Imagine a 30-year period in which your investments average 5% a year\u2014slightly more than the 4% you supposedly needed. But let\u2019s say the first 15 years produced a 0% return. If the next 15 years gave you a 10% return, that\u2019s a 5% average. But after the first 15 years, 60% of your money would be gone.\n\nAnd if such a run of bad years seems implausible, consider that for the 13 years ended Dec. 31, 2012, the price return (excluding dividends) for the S&P 500 was down by about 2.9%.\n\nIncome and price\n\nSo how do you address this risk? It\u2019s important to understand that the total return on your investments is made up of two parts: the price change of the securities you own, plus any income they produce. Investors can focus on the income part of the equation or the price part.\n\nMy position is that income-focused total-return investing has the potential to give you the best of both worlds: a source of cash flow during bad markets and a primary driver of long-term wealth appreciation. There is no meaningful difference in tax efficiency between the two approaches. Both depend on low turnover to minimize taxes. And even if bond and stock prices fall, many investments will continue to produce income in the form of interest and dividends\u2014income that can be spent to pay the bills.\n\nInvestors should first figure out how much income a security is likely to produce over the next 10 to 15 years, and generally allocate a portfolio toward those with the higher total-income potential. Because income returns are generally more stable and easier to predict, you shouldn\u2019t try to forecast underlying asset prices too much. Over time, particularly with equities, if the income production is of high quality and growing, you generally get the capital gains anyway. That\u2019s how income production is linked to a healthy total return-strategy.\n\nDividend payments can even increase when a stock\u2019s price falls, because dividends are set by company management based on long-term fundamentals. By the way, during that 13-year period when the price of the S&P 500 declined, the dividends paid per share roughly doubled. With dividends included, the total return was almost 24%. The dividends represented all of the positive return over that entire cycle.\n\nWhile dividends aren\u2019t guaranteed, they have been far less volatile and more predictable on an annual basis than price movements. Dividends on the S&P 500 declined about 24% in the financial crisis and 7% in the technology bubble, while prices declined about 57% and 50%, respectively. With some fundamental research, investors can increase the odds of maintaining and increasing cash flow through recessions. While financial companies took a hit in dividends and prices in 2008 and 2009, there are many \u201cblue chip\u201d dividend-paying companies in diverse industries that not only maintained dividends but raised them during the financial crisis.\n\nMore than 90% of long-term wealth creation in both the stock and bond markets is the result of the compounding effect of income, its growth and reinvestment.\n\nDividend difference\n\nAccording to Ibbotson Associates, $1 invested in the stock market in 1926 would have grown to about $145 by the end of 2013 through price appreciation alone. But with dividends paid and reinvested, it grows to over $4,600. What this tells us is that the production, growth and reinvestment of income are the primary drivers of long-term wealth accumulation; that\u2019s why you should focus on it and try to produce more of it.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that stocks tend to decline by the amount of the dividend when payouts are made, this is a technical trading matter. On the business valuation side, current and future cash flow dictate value. Most mature and profitable businesses generate more cash than they can reasonably reinvest in their operations. And that excess cash should be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends. If it\u2019s kept in the business, management may actually reduce the company\u2019s value by making poor capital allocation decisions.\n\nMr. Farrell is the chief executive of Northstar Investment Advisors, Denver.

Photo: Abbott Nutrition\n\nFor most older Americans, malnutrition may seem like a remote worry. But evidence is mounting that they should start paying attention\u2014and that a range of age-related factors can interfere with the intake of nutrients necessary to ward off illness, keep the immune system strong, and maintain overall health and well-being.\n\nThe biggest culprits include obvious ones such as poor dietary choices and physical inactivity. But chronic ailments such as heart disease and diabetes and the drugs used to treat them can interfere with food intake and nutrient absorption. And loneliness, grief and depression, such as after the breakup of a marriage or death of a spouse, can disrupt healthful eating habits.\n\n\u201cA whole host of medical and social issues or underlying medical conditions can be responsible for poor nutritional status in older adults,\u201d says Donald Hensrud, a nutrition specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and editor of the health system\u2019s Mayo Clinic Diet program. For example, adults living alone may eat the same thing over and over again because it\u2019s easy, or lose interest in cooking and eating for one, so they end up on a \u201ccookies and milk\u201d diet, Dr. Hensrud says.\n\nA study of older adults published last July in Geriatric Nursing found that while those who were depressed, widowed or both had higher intake of some nutrients, the majority of nutrient levels along with caloric intake were below the amounts recommended by national dietary guidelines. The study cited other research showing that, in comparison to peers who were married, widowed individuals are also more likely to consume fewer vegetables and eat foods that aren\u2019t nutritious, and less likely to prepare homemade meals.\n\nGrowing Risk\n\nThe swell of aging baby boomers, makes it increasingly important for medical professionals to evaluate older patients for nutritional deficiencies and ensure they are consuming a balanced diet, Dr. Hensrud says. Often, malnourishment may be recognized only when older adults are admitted to the hospital, including for elective surgeries.\n\nMalnutrition associated with eight diseases costs the U.S. health-care system $156.7 billion annually, according to a recent study published in the Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition. The researchers received funding from Abbott Nutrition, which makes nutritional supplements used in hospitals.\n\nPatients with diseases such as diabetes or congestive heart failure may be at risk of malnourishment because of dietary restrictions such as limits on salt, fat, protein or sugar that may lead to inadequate eating. Smokers who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also known as emphysema, are at risk of malnourishment due to poor eating habits, lack of exercise and suppressed appetite, as well as changes in their metabolism, which make it harder for the body to absorb nutrients from food. Heavy drinkers are also at risk because excess alcohol interferes with the digestion and absorption of food.\n\nWhile unintentional weight loss is often a sign of problems, overweight and even obese adults can be malnourished if they are sedentary and consuming unhealthy food.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic recommends a plant-based diet with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole-grain carbohydrates, healthy fats such as olive oil and canola oil, and leaner types of protein. Most studies show that popping handfuls of dietary supplements is of little use and can even be harmful in large quantities. But in some cases, such as vitamin D, which is essential for strong bones, and Vitamin B12, which is important for the function of the brain and nervous system, it may be advisable to supplement the diet in some way. Because some people over 50 have trouble absorbing the vitamin B12 found naturally in foods, the National Institute on Aging recommends foods fortified with B12 such as cereal.\n\nProtein consumption, along with regular physical activity, is vital for maintaining muscle mass and strength, \u201cbut many older individuals do not consume enough protein to maintain their muscle mass,\u201d says Edward Archer, a researcher at the Nutrition Obesity Research Center at the University of Alabama, Birmingham. That can trigger what he calls \u201ca downward spiral to frailty.\u201d\n\nBigger Appetite\n\nNew evidence shows that older adults need more dietary protein than younger adults to make up for age-related changes in the way the body metabolizes protein. In a Journal of the American Medical Directors Association report in 2013, an international study group recommended average daily intake in the range of 1.0 to 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day (divide your weight in pounds in half, and the result is roughly how many grams of protein you need daily), along with endurance and resistance-type exercises to help those over 65 maintain or regain lean body mass and function. Those with acute or chronic diseases need even more dietary protein, or as much as 1.5 grams per kilogram of body weight, the group said.\n\nHospitals are increasingly educating their staffers on how to recognize malnutrition in older patients, screening patients within 24 hours of admittance and at regular intervals throughout their hospital stay. They are using new guidelines from the leading nutrition and dietetic societies, which say at least two of six factors must be present to diagnose malnutrition: insufficient food intake, weight loss, fat loss, loss of muscle mass, fluid buildup that can mask weight loss, and diminished functional ability measured by hand-grip strength.\n\nAccording to the Alliance to Advance Patient Nutrition, a nonprofit group that includes the Society of Hospital Medicine, the Academy of Medical-Surgical Nurses, and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, malnourished patients are up to three times as likely as others to develop an infection at the site of surgery or pneumonia after an operation, and twice as likely to develop bedsores. Close to half of patients who fall in a hospital are malnourished.\n\nMs. Landro is an assistant managing editor for The Wall Street Journal in New York and writes the Informed Patient column.

I would like to know what the procedure is. I realize that the 401(k) would have to be closed out and the company stock would have to be segregated.\n\nPeter Baldino, Bethpage, N.Y.\n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to deduct a loss on securities held in a retirement account, says Jeffrey Levine, a CPA with Ed Slott & Co. in Rockville Centre, N.Y. But there is a potential benefit when a 401(k) account includes company stock that has gone up a lot in value\u2014and there\u2019s a \u201cneat little trick\u201d today that just might help you take advantage of that in the future, Mr. Levine says.\n\nFirst, the basics: Dollars withdrawn from a 401(k) to which you made pretax contributions are generally taxed at ordinary-income rates. The tax bill is deferred if you roll money into an individual retirement account. But with company shares, if certain conditions are met, you also have an option at retirement to transfer those shares to a taxable brokerage account.\n\nA transfer can pay off if the shares have gone up a lot: You pay ordinary-income tax at the time of the transfer on what you paid for the shares over the years. But when you sell later, all the appreciation will be taxed at lower capital-gains rates. (Fidelity Investments\u2019 website offers a detailed explanation.)\n\nFor workers whose company stock in a 401(k) has tumbled, Mr. Levine suggests selling the shares now and repurchasing them within the plan, which sets the cost basis lower.\n\nIf the shares do well from here, you might eventually get to take advantage of that break on company-stock gains after all.\n\n***\n\nWhen one converts funds in a SEP-IRA or a similar type of IRA into a Roth IRA, is the amount converted treated as income in determining whether Social Security benefit amounts are affected?\n\nI am a 61-year-old widower and am planning to retire this year; I am thinking of taking surviving-spouse Social Security benefits beginning in 2015.\n\nHoward Hertzberg, Lakewood, Colo.\n\nPeople who receive Social Security retirement or survivor benefits before their full retirement age see their benefits reduced if earnings exceed certain levels. But the earnings limits involve only wages and net earnings from self-employment. Income from a Roth IRA conversion or other investment earnings aren\u2019t an issue. (For details on the earnings limits, see Social Security\u2019s \u201cHow Work Affects Your Benefits\u201d on SocialSecurity.gov.)\n\nIncome from a Roth IRA conversion may, however, affect the taxation of Social Security benefits. Tax is due if income exceeds certain thresholds, and that calculation uses a broad measure of income that would include a Roth conversion and other investment earnings, as well as half of Social Security benefits received. On an individual return, up to half of benefits may be taxable if income is between $25,000 and $34,000; at higher incomes, up to 85% of benefits may be taxable.\n\nYou might ask an accountant or other adviser to analyze the impact of a Roth conversion, weighing both a lump-sum conversion and partial conversions spread out over multiple years.\n\n***\n\nI understand that the Internal Revenue Service has clarified that it\u2019s possible to roll after-tax contributions in a 401(k) plan over to a Roth IRA. My issue is that I can\u2019t find any notice of the amount of my after-tax contributions when my 401(k) was transferred from a company-stock plan to a plan at a securities firm. But I do have much older quarterly statements, which showed the exact dollar amount of my after-tax contributions. Would the recent IRS ruling support taking out the after-tax dollar amount from my 401(k)?\n\nMichael Michaelski, Lexington, S.C.\n\nAs you note, a recent IRS notice spells out the option to shift the after-tax dollars in a 401(k) to a tax-free Roth, while rolling pretax money to a traditional IRA. That provides a new incentive for some savers to make after-tax 401(k) contributions. I suggest you contact your current plan administer to see if your tax information can be incorporated into the company\u2019s reporting system.\n\nFollowing any distribution or rollover, the plan will send a 1099-R tax form to you and to the IRS, which will show the taxable amount of the distribution, if any, or indicate \u201ctaxable amount not determined.\u201d Ideally, you want that document to state that after-tax money you roll into a Roth IRA isn\u2019t taxable.\n\nBut it sounds like you do have sufficient documentation to prove that to the IRS if need be.\n\nEncore welcomes your questions at encore@wsj.com.

One should never move to a new home simply to be close to adult children and grandchildren; they may relocate and leave you in the lurch. Hold fast to the friends you have; making new friends after retiring is difficult, if not impossible.\n\nWell, in the past couple of years, my husband and I have broken every one of these rules\u2014and a few more for good measure. We only wish we had done it sooner.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nIn October 2011, our youngest daughter died of breast cancer. My husband was 79, and I was 76. Plans for our elder years were shattered. Our lives were turned upside down.\n\nAfter six months, the grief and fog of disbelief began to lift. With the help of a therapist, reading what we could find about losing middle-aged children (there is very little on the subject) and visits with family, we began to think that we should move to San Diego from our home in southern Arizona to be near our older daughter and son.\n\nWhy Not?\n\nNot surprisingly, that idea met with little enthusiasm among our friends, who proceeded to tell us why they wouldn\u2019t move.\n\nBetty, for instance, said, \u201cMy life is here now. I\u2019m afraid of the unknown, and I don\u2019t like winters in Michigan.\u201d\n\nSarah said, \u201cI can\u2019t drive the freeways in California\u2014and what will I do with all this stuff?\u201d\n\nShirley said, \u201cA move now would kill me. John wanted to move five years ago, but I was too involved with my volunteer work. I\u2019ve waited too long. Now, damn him, he\u2019s gone, and I\u2019m alone.\u201d\n\nAnd so it went.\n\nBut when we looked hard at our situation, a move increasingly seemed worth the risk. No, there was no guarantee that our children and grandchildren would stay put. But they seemed happy where they lived. Yes, selling our home and downsizing would be painful. But missing the chance to be part of weddings, school graduations, birthdays, births and anniversaries\u2014the generational threads that bind us\u2014would be more painful still.\n\nWe felt we had 10 good years left. Our daughter Kerry put it bluntly: \u201cMom, I don\u2019t want to have to move you or Dad in the middle of a crisis. You\u2019ve been saving money for a rainy day all your life. Look out the window\u2014it\u2019s pouring.\u201d\n\nMultiple Fractures\n\nWith that, we decided to break the think-twice-about-moving-close-to-adult-children rule. And the breaking kept right on going.\n\nToday, we rent a large two-bedroom, two-bath apartment (with a terrace and a view that we treasure) on the third floor of a senior independent living community in central San Diego. That\u2019s right, we rent. No mortgage, no yard work, no maintenance worries. When a light bulb burns out\u2014or if the oven isn\u2019t heating just right, or the plumbing is running slow\u2014I call the front office. Problem fixed. Many of our friends are also making this choice.\n\nThe next two rules\u2014\u201cIf you move, you will never find another church, doctor or hairdresser that you like,\u201d and, \u201cYou can\u2019t make new friends after a certain age\u201d\u2014are fiction. Where is it written that you can\u2019t get out and look for new services and build new ties? In our case, world-class medical care (at Scripps Health and the University of California, San Diego) is less than 10 miles away. Our new dentist and hair salon are close by. We don\u2019t even have to drive on freeways if we don\u2019t want to.\n\nAnd making friends isn\u2019t difficult. For us, it has been a matter of attending some of the many planned activities and meeting folks who share the same interests. A large library, kitchen and dining area for potlucks, pool, spa and walking paths are right here. Wear a smile on your face and be ready to introduce yourself.\n\nHas all this been easy? No. I loved my house in Arizona and our yard, with its Meyer lemon tree, herb garden and award-winning iris. On the day when the moving men carried out boxes and furniture, I drank most of a bottle of wine from the mostly empty fridge, and I cried.\n\nWe know, too, that we have limits. I don\u2019t know if we could handle another move now, physically or emotionally. A few medical problems are developing, our resiliency is not what it was, and we are more easily confused.\n\nThe Rewards\n\nBut the rewards for breaking with convention have been incalculable.\n\nWe see family often. A picnic in nearby La Jolla, with four generations present, marked our 60th wedding anniversary. We have gone whale watching and driven to the spring strawberry fields. We watched as our great-granddaughter Polly took her first stand-up ride on a surfboard.\n\nWhen two adult grandsons tell us of their business success and plans for another store, we feel privileged to share in their lives\u2014and share a bit of wisdom about dealing with customers. When our great-grandchildren run to us with open arms, we know they love us and will remember us. We are building memories for them.\n\nNone of us know what the future has in store. We can only depend on the knowledge that, having weathered life\u2019s storms, we will adapt.\n\nSo go ahead: Break some rules. Don\u2019t let inertia hold you back. While life changes, love lasts.\n\nThe only question we ask ourselves is: What took us so long?\n\nMs. Pate is a writer living in San Diego.

How do couples keep the spark alive?\n\nThat is the focus of a new book by noted gerontologist Karl Pillemer, \u201c30 Lessons for Loving: Advice From the Wisest Americans on Love, Relationships and Marriage.\u201d Dr. Pillemer, a professor at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., surveyed more than 700 women and men age 65 and older. Among his key findings: A willingness to share new interests in midlife and beyond is critical.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s striking how many couples talked about diverging interests as a focal point about whether they became closer or more distant,\u201d he says.\n\nWe recently spoke with Dr. Pillemer about his research. Here are edited excerpts.\n\nPartner\u2019s Interests\n\nWSJ: If you could give one piece of advice for keeping relationships alive through the years, what would it be?\n\nDR. PILLEMER: The romantic spark is important, but over the long term there has to be something more, and that is friendship. A core aspect of that is the ability to embrace your partner\u2019s interests, even if you aren't initially particularly interested.\n\nWSJ: What are some examples?\n\nDR. PILLEMER: A positive example is a woman in her mid-70s who, after years of being a resentful golf widow, took up the sport with her husband. He told her that had been his life dream for her to play with him.\n\nIn another case, a husband started going to the ballet and opera with his wife, and she started to go to sports events with him. Rather than fighting about competing interests, figure out how you can share them in a meaningful way.\n\nWSJ: Are there everyday behaviors that help for the long run?\n\nDR. PILLEMER: Pay attention to and make a habit of small, positive everyday actions. Say it\u2019s a cold, rainy morning, and it\u2019s your partner\u2019s day to walk the dog. You offer to do it instead. Or you surprise your partner by cleaning out the garage to give him a break.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget to give compliments. A major regret I heard was not expressing enough positive feelings, and of too often taking the other for granted. Marriage is made up of thousands of micro-interactions. If you can keep creating positive feelings in those small ways, that will have a major impact.\n\nMyth About No Sex\n\nWSJ: What about sex? Does that change?\n\nDR. PILLEMER: The idea of the sexless older years is really a myth. The major reason that older people aren\u2019t sexually active is lack of a partner. People who have partners and are in reasonable shape do continue to have sexual intimacy.\n\nAlso, over the years, there is a broadening of the concept of sexuality to involve a greater sense of other kinds of intimacy, such as the importance of touching and a more general sense of physical pleasure of being around one another. One woman told me that if you\u2019re attracted to someone you can feel that way until the end of your life.\n\nWSJ: What impact do physical changes over the years have on intimacy?\n\nDR. PILLEMER: I thought people would emphasize inner beauty and disregard physical appearance, but I was wrong about that. Over and over people said that if you really want to keep the spark alive you\u2019ll take care of your appearance.\n\nThat didn\u2019t mean conforming to an impossible standard, but making the most of what you\u2019ve got.\n\nInterestingly, male respondents were harder on other men and females on other females. One piece of really good news was that many people said that if you\u2019ve grown old together, your partner seems the same as they always were.\n\nWSJ: A study published in 2012 in the Journals of Gerontology found that the rate of divorce among married people 50 and older jumped to 10.05 per 1,000 in 2010 from 4.87 in 1990. Should those statistics scare people?\n\nDR. PILLEMER: I wouldn\u2019t want people to get discouraged. Many people still do make it to the finish line of a lifelong marriage, and a lot of people find a relationship the second time around that is just as happy as, or happier than, the first. So I came away optimistic about marriage in the later years.\n\nWSJ: When couples grow apart, should they seek professional counseling before deciding to separate?\n\nDR. PILLEMER: The endorsement of marriage counseling was universal among those I interviewed. So many couples went through awful periods and almost broke up, but they held it together and were extraordinarily happy they did so. Others who did divorce wish they had tried harder.\n\nCertainly, there are marriages that should absolutely end. But if you\u2019re having trouble and your partner says \u201cwe need counseling,\u201d you have to say yes.\n\nMany found this was exactly what they needed to save the relationship. Others found that the breakup was far less acrimonious because of it, or felt less regret later because they had tried.\n\nTrying Again\n\nWSJ: What would your interviewees say to those who are divorced or widowed and looking for love again at middle-age and beyond? What qualities and values should they look for?\n\nDR. PILLEMER: If your friends are telling you that your prospective partner seems controlling or disparaging or moody, you should really listen. That is a protection against the feeling that you\u2019re getting older and \u201cthis is my last chance.\u201d\n\nMany people also suggest making a list: writing down what you are looking for in a relationship. One woman I interviewed had gone through two disastrous marriages, and before entering another, she did just that and showed her list to the person she was dating. The idea of making this explicit early on and writing down what you want and need came up a surprising number of times.\n\nWSJ: Any closing advice?\n\nDR. PILLEMER: Long-term marriage is a discipline. It\u2019s not always easy. But when it works, it can be incredibly good, kind of transcendentally wonderful. Something worth striving for.\n\nMs. Cole is a writer in New York. She can be reached at encore@wsj.com.", "date": null, "title": "Forget \u2018Gray Divorce\u2019: Here\u2019s How to Make Love Last"}

Then, as quickly as that nest egg came, it went\u2014leaving behind regret, sleepless nights, and in the worst case, panic selling near the bottom that eliminated any possibility of recovery.\n\nThis happened in the late 1990s, as the tech-stock bubble produced a blizzard of paper millionaires that melted away faster than a cherry snow cone in August. It happened in the mid-2000s, as Americans grew ever more comfortable with stock-heavy portfolios and with treating their home equity as an ATM, only to be savaged by the worst financial crisis since the Depression.\n\nAnd it will happen again. In March, the current bull market will be six years old. It might run an additional six years\u2014or end in April. Regardless, the lesson from financial history is clear:\n\nWhen you\u2019ve won the game, stop playing.\n\nSo, retirement nest-egg-wise, what constitutes \u201cwinning\u201d? Simple: You\u2019ve won when you\u2019ve acquired enough assets to provide your basic living expenses for the rest of your life.\n\nPascal\u2019s Theory\n\nTake a few minutes. Add up your basic annual expenses, and make sure to include the taxes you\u2019ll owe on required and voluntary withdrawals from your retirement accounts and on the income and capital gains in your taxable assets. Then subtract your Social Security and, if you\u2019re lucky, pension checks. This leaves you with your residual living expenses, or RLE.\n\nIf you need $70,000 a year to meet expenses and pay taxes\u2014and if your Social Security and pension income amounts to $30,000 a year\u2014you must come up with an RLE of $40,000. A good rule of thumb is to have, at the very least, 25 years of RLE saved up to retire at 60, 20 years to retire at 65, and 17 years to retire at 70\u2014or in this case, $1 million, $800,000 and $680,000, respectively.\n\nThe rub is that your retirement is reasonably assured only if the bulk of those assets is in relatively safe holdings. On three different occasions in the past eight decades, the S&P 500 has experienced five-year drawdowns of 30% to 60%; if you enter retirement at the start of such a bad stretch and stack 5% annual withdrawals on top of those equity losses, your nest egg will evaporate so fast that you\u2019ll have little left by the time the markets finally recover.\n\nIf you\u2019re of a certain age and have saved and invested well, it\u2019s possible you\u2019ve just now won the race. As such, this may be a good time to start reducing the risk in your portfolio.\n\nYou say you can\u2019t abide the crummy yields in your now larger bond portfolio? Then cheer up: Those paltry coupons are the direct result of accommodative Federal Reserve policy, which has inflated the stocks in your portfolio. In plain English, if you have substantial equity exposure, you have far more assets than you would without Fed intervention, and the pile of fixed-income securities you can now buy with those equities will more than make up for their low yields.\n\nSo just how do I know that stocks will decline in the coming years? I don\u2019t. Rather, I bear in mind Blaise Pascal.\n\nThe great 17th century philosopher and mathematician posited that belief in God was a paying proposition: If one believed and was wrong, all that was lost was a lifetime of unnecessary piousness and Sunday sermons. Betting against Him and being wrong, on the other hand, produced a different and rather warmer outcome.\n\nIn other words, the probability of error matters less than its consequences. Put yet another way, when faced with the imponderable, the wisest course is the one with the most acceptable worst-case scenario. (More recently, Warren Buffett expressed the same idea in describing the 1998 collapse of Long Term Capital Management: \u201cTo make money they didn\u2019t need, they risked what they did have and did need.\u201d)\n\nRetirement investing fits this to a T. Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve acquired an adequate retirement nest egg, as defined above, and decide to increase your bond exposure in the belief that stock prices will fall. But\u2026the stock market proves you wrong by powering ahead. Sure, you\u2019ll be sorry you just blew your chance to buy a BMW and fly business class.\n\nBut if you bet on rising prices and hold a too-high equity exposure\u2014and straight out of the gate run your barely adequate savings into the buzz saw of retirement withdrawals during a bear market\u2014the outcome will be far, far worse. This is precisely what happened to many new retirees in 2000 and in 2008, and at some point, it will certainly happen again to retirees who should have known better.\n\nJust Do It\n\nTake a hypothetical investor named George who retired on Jan. 1, 2000, at age 65 with a $1 million all-stock portfolio, and spent $50,000 a year on his RLE, adjusted for inflation. Considering the S&P 500 lost 41.2% in nominal dollars (or 53.4% after inflation) between the day he retired and Feb. 28, 2009, George would have barely $100,000 left of his nest egg by the end of September 2014. Had he held a 70/30 stock/bond portfolio, using intermediate Treasurys as his bond component, he would have $428,000 left; and had he held a 40/60 portfolio, he\u2019d have $703,000 left.\n\nGeorge got into trouble with an overly aggressive portfolio because his nest egg was barely adequate to support his retirement\u2014that is, the recommended 20 years of RLE.\n\nIn contrast, his cousin Greg also had a nest egg of $1 million, but only $25,000 of RLE\u2014that is, 40 years of expenses. At 100/0, 70/30, and 40/60, he had $939,000, $1.2 million, and $1.4 million left as of the end of September 2014.\n\nBoth historical back testing and Monte Carlo analysis suggest that a 65-year-old with only 20 years of RLE in his nest egg should hold no more than 50% of his or her portfolio in equities; if you have 35 years of RLE, then up to 70% is probably safe; and if you have 50 years of RLE, then even an all-stock portfolio is reasonable\u2014if you can stomach it.\n\nIf you do decide to reduce your equity exposure, how quickly should you do it? Since no one knows when, or even if, stock valuations will decline, the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer to this question will only be clear in hindsight; you could do it all at once, or you could do it gradually over the next few years. The key thing, though, is to do it.\n\nSomewhere, high above, Blaise Pascal will smile on you.\n\nMr. Bernstein is an investment adviser and author, most recently, of \u201cIf You Can: How Millennials Can Get Rich Slowly.\u201d He lives in Portland, Ore.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tips-for-taxpayers-who-received-filing-extensions-1442800945", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Illustration: Lloyd Miller for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMany procrastinators face an important deadline in about 3\u00bd weeks.\n\nMillions of people who received tax-filing extensions from the Internal Revenue Service beyond the April 15 deadline typically have until Oct. 15 to file their returns. If this slipped your mind, or you just can\u2019t stand thinking about trying to find your records in those overstuffed shoeboxes, it\u2019s time to get started.\n\nHere are a few last-minute suggestions from accountants, tax lawyers and enrolled agents\u2014tax experts who are authorized to represent taxpayers at all levels of the IRS\u2014on how to avoid blunders in some key areas:\n\nSales taxes: Late last year, Congress revived a provision that had expired at the end of 2013. This back-from-the-dead provision gave taxpayers who itemize a choice: They can deduct their state and local sales taxes instead of their state and local income taxes. (They can\u2019t deduct both.) Deducting sales taxes, instead of state income taxes, can benefit millions of people who live in states with no state income tax, such as Florida, Washington and Texas. The option applies to all taxpayers who itemize, however, and could help many people in other states, as well, says Suzanne L. Shier, chief wealth planning and tax strategist at Northern Trust in Chicago. As reported earlier this year, the sales-tax provision expired again, and Congress has yet to restore it for the 2015 tax year. But it can be used on 2014 returns.\n\nCharitable gifts: If you itemize your deductions and plan to deduct your charitable donations, pay attention to record-keeping rules. The kind of required documentation may vary depending on such factors as how much you gave and the type of gift (such as cash, noncash, or out-of-pocket expenses when donating your services), the IRS says in Publication 526.\n\nFor example, if you donated $250 or more to a charity, be sure to get an acknowledgment that includes important details such as the name of the charity, the amount and date of your gift\u2014and whether you received goods or services in return, such as tickets to the theater or a sports event. If you did get something in return, the charity is supposed to say so and estimate the value. (There are some exceptions to the general requirement, such as \u201ccertain token items and membership benefits.\u201d) You can deduct only the amount that exceeds that value. For example, if you donated $500 and received sports tickets worth $150, you may deduct $350, not $500. Even if you didn\u2019t get something in return, the acknowledgment should say so.\n\nWarning: Don\u2019t wait to see whether your return gets audited before asking the charity for a receipt. The law says donors \u201ccannot claim an income-tax deduction for a contribution of $250 or more unless the donor has a contemporaneous written acknowledgment of the gift from the charity,\u201d says Martin Hall, a partner at the law firm of Ropes & Gray LLP in Boston. What does that mean? \u201cThe regulations provide that an acknowledgment is timely if secured by the donor/taxpayer no later than the earlier of (i) the date the donor files his or her income-tax return for the tax year in which the contribution was made or (ii) the due date for filing such a return. So, you cannot wait until you get an audit letter to comply with this requirement,\u201d Mr. Hall says. (He also notes that in some cases involving larger gifts, donors also will need a qualified appraisal. (Go to irs.gov for details.)\n\nExcess FICA: Did you work for two or more employers last year? This might include moonlighters, as well as high-wage workers who switched jobs during the year. If so, how much Social Security tax was withheld from your pay? For 2014, the maximum wages subject to Social Security tax was $117,000; thus, the maximum amount of tax that should have been withheld was $7,254 (6.2% of $117,000). If you had too much withheld, see IRS Publication 17 for details on how to claim a credit for any excess amount.\n\nEstimated-tax payments: Did you make any estimated tax payments for 2014 or an additional payment when you filed for an extension earlier this year? If so, double-check to make sure how much you paid, says Northern Trust\u2019s Ms. Shier. \u201cPeople sometimes lose track\u201d of how much they\u2019ve already paid, she says.\n\nFixing mistakes: If you discover errors on returns you\u2019ve already filed, consider \u201camending\u201d those returns. For your federal return, use Form 1040X. But there are time limits. The IRS says the general rule is you must file your claim for a credit or refund \u201cwithin 3 years after the date you filed your original return or within 2 years after the date you paid the tax, whichever is later.\u201d (There are exceptions for certain circumstances, such as bad debts and worthless securities. Publication 17 has details.) Returns filed before the due date, without regard to extensions, are considered filed on the due date, the IRS says. If you amend your federal return, check to see if you need to do likewise for any state or local returns, too.\n\n***\n\nCyberspace appears increasingly dangerous these days. Hackers have invaded some of the world\u2019s most formidable fortresses, including the IRS. So, if you owe money to Uncle Sam (such as for required estimated-tax payments every few months) what\u2019s the best and most secure way to pay?\n\nPhoto: iStock/Getty Images\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, there isn\u2019t one right way for every taxpayer,\u201d says Ms. Shier of Northern Trust.\n\nDespite all the alarming news about hackers and antiquated IRS computer systems, many experts strongly recommend using a free IRS electronic-payment option called \u201cDirect Pay.\u201d This view emerged clearly from veteran tax professionals during a New York University School of Professional Studies conference, as well as from other experts this summer.\n\n\u201cI have been surprised how many of my clients have used and appreciated the online Direct Pay system,\u201d says Claudia Hill, the owner of Tax Mam Inc., a tax services firm based in Cupertino, Calif., and an enrolled agent. \u201cI even used it myself to make my extension payment\u201d last April, she says.\n\nFor details on this and other options, go to the IRS website (irs.gov/payments or irs.gov/e-pay). You can use Direct Pay \u201cto pay your individual tax bill or estimated tax payment directly from your checking or savings account at no cost to you,\u201d the IRS says. \u201cYou\u2019ll receive instant confirmation that your payment has been submitted. Bank account information isn\u2019t retained in the IRS systems after payments are made.\u201d \u201c\n\nAs of Aug. 29, IRS Direct Pay had received almost 6.2 million payments totaling over $18.9 billion since the system was launched in early 2014,\u201d says Eric Smith, an IRS spokesman.\n\nMr. Herman is a writer in New York City.

An individual earning as little as $25,000 from combined sources may owe taxes on up to 50% of his or her benefit.\n\nHere are some tips older Americans can use to reduce or avoid the amount of taxes they might pay on their Social Security benefits.\n\nConvert to A Roth IRA.\n\nOne strategy is to convert all or some of your traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. Distributions from a traditional IRA are viewed as income that could affect your benefit. Qualified distributions from a Roth IRA, however, are nontaxable and won't affect benefits.\n\nThere are a few catches. Amounts from Roth conversions count toward your taxable annual income, so the ideal time to do a Roth conversion is before Social Security benefits start.\n\n\"It means biting the bullet and paying taxes sooner than you need to,\" says Elaine Floyd, director of retirement and life planning at Horsesmouth, a New York City-based provider of content to financial advisers.\n\nBut you can also make partial, strategic conversions, spreading them out to benefit from a lower tax rate, Ms. Floyd says.\n\nDelay Taking Social Security.\n\nThe best thing about delaying the start of your Social Security benefits is it increases your eventual payouts: by 8% for every year that you delay receiving benefits beginning with the year you reach full retirement age\u201467 for people born after 1959\u2014until 70.\n\nMost retirees should defer collecting Social Security for as long as they can, and draw on their retirement accounts when they need money, says David Freitag, vice president at Impact Technologies Group Inc., a Charlotte, N.C. financial-planning technology firm.\n\nBy drawing down your retirement funds, Mr. Freitag says, you also are reducing the amount of your required minimum distributions after you turn 70\u00bd, which could lower your taxable income if you have a traditional IRA.\n\nConvert Your 'Countable' Income.\n\nIf you're already collecting benefits and have investment income that you don't need\u2014and that pushes your benefit into taxable territory\u2014consider \"converting your countable income into non-countable income,\" says Andy Landis, founder of Thinking Retirement, a retirement-education website.\n\nFor example, a certificate of deposit generating $5,000 of unneeded income may trigger Social Security taxation. But you could sell the CD and buy a deferred annuity instead, Mr. Landis says. The income will be deferred, and so will any tax owed on it.\n\nThe same is true if you own a traditional IRA or tax-advantaged investments such as stocks that don't pay dividends and so are subject only to capital-gains tax. With those types of accounts and investments, you could delay any tax impact by not taking distributions from your traditional IRA until age 70\u00bd, or by putting off generating capital gains until necessary.\n\nSimply put, having money in an IRA can allow you to time the receipt of that income to avoid being taxed on your Social Security benefit. You have to coordinate and balance the withdrawals from your taxable and retirement accounts with your Social Security checks so they support the best tax strategy.\n\nSays Mr. Freitag, \"Just like a seesaw on a playground, balancing is the key to a successful, fun ride and not a crash.\"\n\nMr. Powell is the editor of Retirement Weekly and a columnist at MarketWatch.com.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/are-donor-advised-funds-useful-1446433522", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nMy friend David Anderson, a retired banker now living mainly in New Hampshire, is very interested in charitable giving and wants to know more about an increasingly popular tool known as a donor-advised fund.\n\n\u201cWhat are the chances of legislative changes that might affect charitable giving and donor-advised funds?\u201d Mr. Anderson asks. \u201cHow do these donor-advised funds work, and are they a good way to give to charity?\u201d\n\nThese are timely questions as millions of taxpayers consider the intricacies of year-end tax-saving maneuvers, including charitable-giving strategies.\n\nMore than 36 million federal income-tax returns for 2013 reported deductions for charitable contributions, according to the Internal Revenue Service. And donor-advised funds are \u201ca quickly growing part of the charitable sector,\u201d says a report by Ellen Steele and C. Eugene Steuerle for the Urban Institute\u2019s Tax Policy and Charities Initiative.\n\nMany thumbs up\n\nLet\u2019s start with Mr. Anderson\u2019s questions about how these funds work and whether they\u2019re a good way to make charitable contributions.\n\nDonor-advised funds have surged in popularity over the years, and many tax lawyers, accountants and financial planners enthusiastically recommend them as a tax-efficient, highly convenient and remarkably simple charitable-giving vehicle.\n\nWith a typical fund, you can make your donation in the current year and take a tax deduction for that year even if you don\u2019t decide which charities should get the money until future years. Meanwhile, the money gets invested and can grow, tax-free.\n\n\u201cThey can be a very useful vehicle for many people who want to make a gift in one year and distribute it later,\u201d says Carol G. Kroch, managing director, wealth and philanthropic planning, at Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Del.\n\nWhy would you want to do that? There are several possible reasons. For example, you might conclude this is an ideal year, for tax purposes, to make large amounts of charitable donations but you haven\u2019t selected which of your favorite charities should get some, or all, of those gifts. Or perhaps you are concerned that lawmakers might impose new curbs on charitable-giving deductions for upper-income taxpayers in future years, and thus it would be best to take as big a deduction as possible while you\u2019re sure you still can.\n\nAt a recent tax seminar at Baruch College in New York, Sidney Kess, a veteran tax expert and author, asked the audience for their reactions to donor-advised funds. Many hands shot up, and several certified public accountants gave the funds rave reviews. \u201cThey are an excellent way for many people to donate to charity,\u201d Mr. Kess said in an interview.\n\nDo your homework\n\nYou can sign up for a donor-advised fund through many institutions, including such investment giants as Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab, T. Rowe Price Group and Vanguard Group. But before you pick one, do some homework.\n\nDetails can vary widely from fund to fund on many terms and features, such as the minimum initial contribution, the minimum-size grant, fees and investment options.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be super rich to set up an account. At Fidelity Charitable, for example, the minimum initial contribution is $5,000. That\u2019s also the minimum at Schwab Charitable. Others have significantly higher minimums.\n\nFor the grants you make, the minimums are much lower. The minimum grant at both Fidelity and Schwab, for instance, is $50.\n\nAt Fidelity Charitable, the median account size is about $16,000, says Amy Danforth, the fund\u2019s president. In 2014, Fidelity Charitable made $2.6 billion in donor-recommended grants to more than 90,000 charities. That\u2019s more than double the $1.2 billion granted in 2010. (Personal disclosure: My wife and I have long held an account at Fidelity Charitable and make many of our donations\u2014but not all\u2014through it.)\n\nDoings in Washington\n\nAs for the legislative outlook, President Barack Obama has called for new limits on the value of itemized deductions, including charitable donations, for high-income taxpayers. And last year, then-Rep. Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican who at the time was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed a major tax-law overhaul that included important changes involving charitable-gift deductions. He also proposed requiring that assets parked in donor-advised funds (sometimes known as charitable-gift funds) be distributed within five years of when they were placed there.\n\nThese proposals all have something in common: They have little or no chance of becoming law anytime soon.\n\n\u201cThis is not a Congress that has been active on tax legislation,\u201d says Ms. Kroch of Wilmington Trust. \u201cThey have an awful lot on their plate by year-end. I don\u2019t see this high up on their priorities.\u201d\n\nBut there is an excellent chance that Congress will take action in another arena that involves charitable giving. Lawmakers probably will vote in coming months to extend the life of a popular tax break that expired at the end of 2014.\n\nThe provision allowed taxpayers who were 70\u00bd or older to donate as much as $100,000 directly from an individual retirement account to qualified charities without having to count any of that money as income. If done correctly, that direct transfer counted toward the taxpayer\u2019s required minimum IRA distribution for the year.\n\nCaution: Under the law that expired at the end of last year, donor-advised funds and supporting organizations weren\u2019t eligible recipients for this provision. Nobody knows whether\u2014or when\u2014Congress will act on this and many other expired provisions, and whether lawmakers might tweak the rules for 2015.\n\nMr. Herman is a writer in New York City.

Photo: Christopher Powers/Bloomberg News\n\nTrying to figure out your taxes is painful enough.\n\nBut for many taxpayers, the real nightmare begins when they try to reach a human being at the Internal Revenue Service, or try to get a timely response to a letter, in an effort to resolve a tax dispute. Critics say taxpayer service, never one of the agency\u2019s strongest points, has deteriorated significantly amid congressionally ordered budget cutbacks that also have undermined other key areas within the embattled tax-collection agency.\n\nIf you\u2019re stuck in an IRS bureaucratic quagmire, don\u2019t despair. Here is one possible workaround recommended by many tax experts: Consider getting in touch with the IRS\u2019s Taxpayer Advocate Service.\n\nHeaded by Nina Olson, the outspoken national taxpayer advocate, this unit may be able to help resolve thorny issues taxpayers haven\u2019t been able to fix through usual IRS channels. Many accountants, lawyers and enrolled agents (private-sector tax specialists authorized to represent taxpayers at all levels of the IRS) say the service can often be a surprisingly valuable resource.\n\n\u201cIn the current environment, when it is difficult to reach the IRS by phone, the taxpayer advocate\u2019s office is a breath of fresh air,\u201d says Jim Grimaldi, a tax partner at Citrin Cooperman, an accounting, tax and consulting firm based in New York. Mr. Grimaldi and others say the service can help in slicing through thick IRS red tape, untangling bureaucratic knots and resolving long-running issues.\n\nDon\u2019t expect instant miracles. Getting help still requires patience. \u201cThey\u2019re great. They\u2019re slow, but it\u2019s because they\u2019re overwhelmed,\u201d says Megan L. Brackney, a lawyer at Kostelanetz & Fink, a New York law firm.\n\n\u201cOur cases have increased and our staffing has decreased,\u201d Ms. Olson says. As a result, employees have to \u201cjuggle a lot of taxpayer needs.\u201d\n\nAt two recent tax conferences in New York City, Sidney Kess, a tax expert and special consultant to Citrin Cooperman, asked his audiences for their reactions, positive or negative, to the advocate service. Nearly all of those who responded reported a positive experience\u2014though some expressed disappointment at the outcome and irritation at how much time and energy their battle took.\n\nSome said the service quality can vary significantly around the country.\n\nThe unit\u2019s representatives deal with a wide range of taxpayer headaches. The most widespread problem is tax-related identity theft. In a typical case, a crook steals the victim\u2019s Social Security number, and files a tax return in that person\u2019s name, claiming a refund. The real taxpayer typically doesn\u2019t discover the problem until he or she files later in the tax-filing season. Sorting out the thieves from the innocent victims can take many months, which can, in turn, create major problems for victims who had counted on getting their refunds promptly to pay bills.\n\nIdentity theft continued as the No. 1 reason taxpayers sought assistance from the service in fiscal 2015, Ms. Olson says. Earlier this year, Ms. Olson told lawmakers that the IRS \u201ccan do more\u201d to prevent this problem and \u201cto assist victims.\u201d\n\nIn general, you may be eligible for help \u201cif your IRS problem is causing financial difficulty or you believe an IRS procedure just isn\u2019t working as it should,\u201d the unit says on its website. The unit typically gives priority to \u201ccases where taxpayers are experiencing financial hardship as a result of an IRS action or inaction,\u201d a spokesman says. An example would be someone who may face eviction because of an IRS levy. In fiscal 2015, \u201cthe median cycle time for our closed cases was 53 days, and [the unit] was able to obtain full or partial relief for the taxpayer in 78.4% of our cases,\u201d a spokesman says.\n\nThe unit received some 227,000 cases in fiscal 2015, an official says.\n\nMr. Grimaldi says the service has been helpful in a number of cases involving his firm and its clients, including a case in which an IRS officer \u201cwas not acting reasonably.\u201d After getting the Taxpayer Advocate Service involved, he says, \u201cthe revenue officer\u2019s approach to the case changed,\u201d and a pay-by-installment agreement was reached. In another case, he says the service helped his firm process some amended tax returns, corrected the amount of tax assessed and helped the client set up a pay-by-installment agreement.\n\nAt separate conferences in New York recently, Ms. Olson and Darol Tucker, the advocate in Brooklyn, said they are keenly aware of taxpayer anger about the IRS\u2019s dismal performance in handling phone calls from the public. But many at the conferences gave high marks to the Taxpayer Advocate Service and said they wished it could hire more staff.\n\nEric J. Engelhardt, a CPA in Melville, N.Y., praised the unit as having been \u201cvery helpful\u201d in a large case that took many months to resolve. However, he says, \u201cthey are greatly understaffed.\u201d\n\nMr. Herman is a writer in New York City. He was formerly The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Tax Report columnist.

Annually, nearly one-fifth of Medicare patients\u2014about 2.6 million older adults\u2014end up readmitted within 30 days, a problem so costly that the federal health program now penalizes hospitals for any readmission deemed to be preventable for heart attack, pneumonia and heart failure.\n\nIn a report in the New England Journal of Medicine in January, Harlan Krumholz, a Yale University researcher, identified the condition as \"post-hospital syndrome\" that might derive as much from the physical and emotional stress patients experience in the hospital as from lingering effects of the original illness.\n\nHospital Lag\n\nAmong those stressors is disturbed sleep from the constant noise and activity in the hospital, leaving patients fuzzy, fatigued and confused, like an extreme case of jet lag. Patients may become malnourished from being unable to take food by mouth and suffer from pain and other discomforts that are never adequately addressed.\n\nBeing in bed for any prolonged period can leave patients with little muscle strength, making them vulnerable to falls and accidents. They may be too weak or listless to comply with discharge instructions, and the immune system may still be compromised, opening the door to infections.\n\nDr. Krumholz advises patients to first recognize that they are vulnerable. \"Patients should know they may have survived a major illness, but upon leaving the hospital they now are entering a period in which they are susceptible to a wide range of health problems that could be severe enough to require another hospitalization,\" he says.\n\nRecovery Time\n\nPatients shouldn't underestimate the time they need to recover, he warns. \"This is a time of convalescence when you need your rest and nutrition and physical activity and social support.\" It's important to avoid contact with people who are sick\u2014including cute grandchildren with runny noses\u2014and activities like driving.\n\nMental health is important, as well. Individuals newly released from the hospital who are experiencing stress or wrestling with big decisions should seek help or simply put matters on hold. And don't feel bad if \"you don't remember all that was told you in the hospital,\" Dr. Krumholz adds; a person's ability to concentrate is frequently impaired after a hospital stay.\n\nBut it is also important to have contact with doctors or nurses soon after discharge to review instructions and report any new health problems. Fortunately, many hospitals have special programs to help, including house-call services that send a nurse, doctor or pharmacist home to check on patients and provide follow-up care after discharge.\n\nOne Step at a Time\n\nThe University of California, San Francisco, offers house calls and a special program for heart-failure patients, who have the highest rates of re-hospitalization. Staffers educate patients about managing their disease and medications and make house calls if necessary to check on patients and troubleshoot problems. In 2009, 25% of heart-failure patients were readmitted within 30 days; with the program in place last year, only 10% were readmitted.\n\nWalter Park, who had a heart attack last October and had multiple organ failure during a seven-week hospital stay at UCSF, says that after returning home he was \"weak as a kitten\" and spent months trying to rebuild muscle strength and stamina. Mr. Park, a retired director of a nonprofit agency who also takes multiple medications for AIDS, says the heart-failure team sent a home health nurse who visited three times a week at first to help with medications and monitor his weight and blood pressure, two important measures for heart-failure patients.\n\nA physical therapist also came to the house and helped him with a daunting task: walking up a steep San Francisco hill to the bus stop.\n\n\"I was very discouraged, but I realize it is a very long process to recover,\" Mr. Park says. The UCSF team \"really keeps me on track,\" he adds, and knowing they will be checking his progress helps give him the motivation to stick to his regimen. Recently he was able to climb the steps at Golden Gate Park.\n\nMs. Landro is an assistant managing editor for The Wall Street Journal and writes the paper's Informed Patient column.

For tens of millions of taxpayers, that means the same thing: Plenty of time to procrastinate.\n\nResist that temptation. Getting started early can help make one of America\u2019s most exasperating, frustrating and time-consuming annual chores less taxing.\n\nProcrastination may be hazardous to your wealth even if you pay a tax professional to do your returns or if you use tax-preparation software. After all, it takes considerable time and patience to collect all the necessary forms and documents. And even if you aren\u2019t affected by any new laws, IRS pronouncements, or court decisions, you may need to take a fresh approach to your taxes if you experienced major life changes last year, such as a marriage, birth, divorce or death. But perhaps most important, our tax laws have grown so complex that it is easy to misunderstand the mountains of fine print.\n\nWe asked tax experts for a few suggestions that might be helpful to taxpayers this filing season, including what\u2019s new as well as tricky issues that are easy to misunderstand:\n\nDeadlines: Everyone knows the filing deadline for most taxpayers is April 15, right?\n\nNot this year. This year, it will be Monday, April 18, because of Emancipation Day, an official holiday in Washington, D.C., celebrating the freeing of slaves in the district on April 16, 1862. Because Emancipation Day falls on a Saturday this year, it will be observed on Friday, thus pushing the tax-filing deadline to Monday for most of the nation, the IRS says.\n\nThere are some exceptions. The deadline will be Tuesday, April 19, in Maine and Massachusetts, because of Patriots\u2019 Day, a holiday in those states commemorating the battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775.\n\nMany taxpayers in places jolted by severe storms get even more time. For example, the IRS said recently that storm victims in Mississippi and Missouri will have until May 16 to file returns and pay any taxes due. \u201cAll workers assisting the relief activities who are affiliated with a recognized government or philanthropic organization also qualify for relief,\u201d the IRS says. For more details, see the websites of the Internal Revenue Service or the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nIf you need even more time to file, you can request a six-month extension until Monday, Oct. 17. You don\u2019t need to give the IRS a reason, and millions of people do it every year. Just remember that a filing extension won\u2019t give you additional time to pay whatever you might owe.\n\nEducator expenses: Late last year, Congress resurrected many popular tax breaks that had expired at the end of 2014 and made them permanent. Among them is one that benefits millions of elementary and secondary-school teachers and other educators. Under this provision, an eligible educator can deduct as much as $250 of unreimbursed costs of classroom supplies, such as books, computer equipment and software. This applies to \u201ca kindergarten through grade 12 teacher, instructor, counselor, principal or aide in school for at least 900 hours during a school year,\u201d an IRS publication says. It is especially valuable since they can deduct it from their total income, using line 23 on Form 1040, rather than as a miscellaneous itemized deduction, the IRS says. (If you file Form 1040A, deduct these expenses on line 16, the IRS says.)\n\nSales-tax deduction: This is another popular tax break that Congress recently revived and made permanent. It also is easy to overlook. Here\u2019s how it works: If you file Form 1040 and itemize your deductions, you have a choice. You can deduct either your state and local income taxes or your state and local general sales taxes\u2014but not both. This is a very important break for millions of people who live in Florida, Texas, Washington and other states with no state income tax. But don\u2019t make the mistake of assuming that this rule applies only to taxpayers in those states. It applies throughout the country\u2014and can help many other people in other states, too.\n\n\u201cA lot of people in states with an income tax forget to check to see if the sales-tax deduction might be a better option than the state-income-tax deduction,\u201d says Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting.\n\nFiguring out how to calculate the sales-tax deduction can be tricky. \u201cIf you saved your receipts throughout the year, you can add up the total amount of sales taxes you actually paid and claim that amount,\u201d the IRS says. If you didn\u2019t save receipts, don\u2019t give up. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t save all your receipts, you can still choose to claim state and local sales taxes,\u201d the IRS says. Check out the work sheet and optional general sales tax tables in the Instructions for Schedule A (Form 1040)\u2014or use the IRS\u2019s Sales Tax Deduction Calculator.\n\nCharitable giving: If you deduct charitable donations, make sure you understand the record-keeping rules. For example, be sure to get all the necessary acknowledgments before you file your return, says Martin Hall, partner in the Boston office of Ropes & Gray LLP and head of the law firm\u2019s private client group.\n\n\u201cDonors should get their \u2018docs in a row\u2019 before filing returns,\u201d Mr. Hall quips. He cites a law referring to getting a \u201ccontemporaneous\u201d written acknowledgment. \u201cAn acknowledgment is contemporaneous if obtained on or before the earlier of the date on which the return is filed claiming the deduction or the due date (including extensions) for filing the return,\u201d he says. \u201cThe taxpayer flunks\u2014and flunks badly\u2014if he or she waits to get the acknowledgment until the audit letter is pushed through the mail slot,\u201d he says.\n\nDon\u2019t forget about record-keeping rules for noncash gifts. Mr. Luscombe says, \u201cWhile a lot of people keep track of their cash charitable contributions, they are not so good at keeping documentation of contributions of noncash items or out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of a charity.\u201d\n\nExcess Social Security: This could be an important issue for many upper-income workers who worked for two or more employers last year. If that is you, look at how much all your employers withheld from your pay in Social Security taxes. For 2015, the maximum amount of Social Security tax that should have been withheld from all your paychecks was $7,347. (That is 6.2% of $118,500, which was the maximum amount of wages subject to Social Security tax last year.) If more than that was withheld, claim the excess amount as a credit.\n\nHere is an example from IRS Publication 17, a handy guide for individual income taxes: Suppose you are married and file a joint return with your spouse. Your spouse had no income last year. During 2015, you worked for one company that paid $66,500 and withheld $4,123 in Social Security tax. Another employer paid you $55,000 in wages and withheld $3,410 of Social Security tax. Thus, the total amount of Social Security tax withheld was $7,533, or $186 more than the maximum. Thus, claim a $186 credit on your return.\n\nReinvested dividends: Many investors instruct a company or mutual fund to reinvest their dividends in new shares. That can be a great idea, but keep good records. \u201cA lot of people with reinvested dividends fail to add those previously taxed dividends to their basis in determining the taxable gain on the sale of a stock,\u201d Mr. Luscombe says.\n\nMr. Herman is a writer in New York City.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nBroadway\u2019s brightest star, Alexander Hamilton, summarized the problem neatly.\n\n\u201cIn common life, to retract an error even in the beginning is no easy task,\u201d Mr. Hamilton once wrote, according to Ron Chernow \u2019s biography of the nation\u2019s first Treasury secretary. \u201cPerseverance confirms us in it and rivets the difficulty.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Hamilton wasn\u2019t writing about income-tax bloopers, his words undoubtedly will resonate with millions of modern-day taxpayers. Nobody likes to admit mistakes, especially on tax returns. But as lawmakers continually add layers of complexity to the nation\u2019s tax system, millions of taxpayers each year face thorny questions about how\u2014and even whether\u2014to fix errors and omissions.\n\nTax advisers say some clients fear that filing an amended return is tantamount to waving a red flag in front of auditors, tempting them to question every line. They would rather play the audit lottery and pray they won\u2019t get caught. Others worry that trying to correct even relatively small errors will be too much for the IRS\u2019s antiquated computer systems to handle and could create even more problems.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nThat depends on the details of each case, such as the size, type, number and reasons for the errors. The process may appear relatively simple, but appearances can be deceiving, even in cases involving honest mistakes or new data.\n\nWhat might seem to be a simple change \u201ccan ripple through\u201d the entire tax return and affect many pages, says Claudia Hill, president of TaxMam Inc. in Cupertino, Calif., and an enrolled agent. (Enrolled agents are tax experts authorized to represent taxpayers at all levels of the IRS.) \u201cIt\u2019s rarely a \u2018simple\u2019 change,\u201d Ms. Hill warned in a recent CCH Webinar offered by Wolters Kluwer.\n\nEven so, most taxpayers \u201cshouldn\u2019t be afraid at all\u201d to file an amended return, says Stephen W. DeFilippis of DeFilippis Financial Group, a wealth-management and tax firm in Wheaton, Ill., and an enrolled agent.\n\nReasons for making amends vary widely. Examples include forgetting to report a dividend or interest payment, neglecting to take advantage of various tax credits or deductions, or receiving new information they didn\u2019t have when they filed their original return. Sometimes, people receive fresh information about a partnership interest or a change in the amount of qualified dividend income received from mutual funds and other financial institutions.\n\nWhat may be the right answer for one taxpayer may be wrong for another. Here are answers to some questions readers may have on fixing errors.\n\nQ: How many people typically file amended returns?\n\nA: Eric Smith, an IRS spokesman, says there were about 3.7 million amended returns filed on Form 1040X in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2015.\n\nQ: Can I file an amended return electronically?\n\nA: No. You have to file the old-fashioned paper way.\n\nQ: How quickly does the IRS handle amended returns?\n\nA: Not quickly. Amended returns \u201ctake up to 16 weeks to process and up to three weeks from the date of mailing to show up in our system,\u201d the IRS says in \u201cTopic 308\u201d on its website. Often, though, the process takes longer\u2014much longer, Ms. Hill warned in a recent CCH Webinar offered by Wolters Kluwer.\n\nQ: Should taxpayers bother fixing routine math errors?\n\nA: The IRS says it \u201cmay correct mathematical or clerical errors on a return and may accept returns without certain required forms or schedules.\u201d In such cases, \u201cthere is no need to amend your return.\u201d However, the IRS says, \u201cdo file an amended return if there is a change in your filing status, income, deductions or credits.\u201d\n\nTK\n\nQ: Suppose I want to fix mistakes on tax returns for more than one year? Can I do it all on one Form 1040X?\n\nA: No. File a separate Form 1040X for each year. The IRS wants you to mail each form in a separate envelope. Also, don\u2019t forget to check out any state-filing requirements, Ms. Hill says. The IRS says to include \u201cthe year of the return you are amending at the top of Form 1040X.\u201d\n\nQ: Can I fix just one error and ignore all my other mistakes?\n\nA: No. \u201cIf you file an amended return, you must correct all known mistakes,\u201d Ms. Hill says. \u201cYou can\u2019t cherry-pick what you want to fix.\u201d\n\nQ: Are taxpayers required by law to file amended returns with the IRS to fix errors?\n\nA: No, says Bryan Skarlatos, a tax lawyer at the Kostelanetz & Fink LLP law firm in New York. But millions of people do anyway \u201cbecause they want to get right with the IRS\u201d and because they hope that filing an amended return and paying any balance due will enable them to avoid stiff penalties. Others who amend returns may qualify for a hefty refund or credit.\n\nQ: How far back in time can I go to claim a refund or a credit on my federal return?\n\nA: Generally, for a credit or refund, \u201cyou must file Form 1040X within 3 years (including extensions) after the date you filed your original return or within 2 years after the date you paid the tax, whichever is later,\u201d the IRS says in its Form 1040X instructions.\n\nPREVIOUS TAXES COLUMNS\n\nBut there are exceptions. The time limit can be suspended for some people who are \u201cphysically or mentally unable to manage their financial affairs,\u201d the IRS says. Another exception: An amended return based on bad debts or worthless securities generally \u201cmust be filed within 7 years after the due date of the return for the tax year in which the debt or security became worthless.\u201d See Form 1040X instructions for other exceptions.\n\nQ: What should I do if I want to come clean on something that might be construed as civil fraud or even criminal wrongdoing? Also, what if my return is already being audited?\n\nA: This can be very tricky\u2014and far too complex to delve into in this column. In short: Consider hiring a seasoned pro who specializes in such subjects. Remember that an amended return is \u201can admission that your prior return was wrong,\u201d warns Mr. Skarlatos.\n\nSome lawyers say taxpayers probably shouldn\u2019t file an amended return if they\u2019re already involved in a face-to-face IRS audit involving that return. In such cases, \u201cit usually makes much more sense to speak to the agent about the issue,\u201d rather than filing Form 1040X, says Mr. Skarlatos.\n\nWhat\u2019s the harm in filing an amended return during an audit? \u201cI had a case where an auditor referred the case to the criminal unit because an amended return was filed,\u201d says Mark Klein, a lawyer at Hodgson Russ. \u201cFortunately, it went nowhere. It would not have been an issue if the taxpayer had simply admitted the error to the auditor.\u201d\n\nQ: Will my chances of getting audited increase if I file an amended return?\n\nA: Probably yes, several tax advisers say. \u201cIt makes sense that a taxpayer who files an amended return for a particular year is much more likely to be audited than a taxpayer who files only an original return because an amended return is a second submission to the IRS with respect to the same tax year which itself increases the chance that one of the two returns will be audited,\u201d Mr. Skarlatos says. \u201cFurther, the amended return requires an explanation of what has been changed and the explanation can easily give rise to questions.\u201d In addition, some amended returns request refunds \u201cwhich may trigger a review before a check is sent to the taxpayer.\u201d\n\nAn IRS spokesman says he isn\u2019t aware of any statistics on the subject.\n\nMr. Herman is a writer in New York City.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nHaste makes waste, especially in the increasingly complex and often counterintuitive world of taxes.\n\nAs the year draws to a close, many taxpayers scramble to take advantage of popular, time-honored tax-saving techniques. Be careful, though. Even small missteps can result in costly blunders, particularly for taxpayers making gifts to charity.\n\nAsk Us a Question Have a tax-related question? Email Tom Herman at taxquestions@wsj.com.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget about some of the technicalities involved\u201d and to overlook valuable tax-saving opportunities, says Martin Hall, a partner at the law firm of Ropes & Gray LLP in Boston and chair of the firm\u2019s private-client group.\n\nHere is some 11th-hour advice from lawyers, accountants and enrolled agents (private-sector tax specialists authorized to represent taxpayers at all levels of the Internal Revenue Service).\n\nTIMING DEDUCTIONS: Around this time, tax advisers often urge clients to accelerate as many deductions as possible into the current year. But in some cases, the reverse strategy works better. For example, don\u2019t rush to make charitable donations now if you are sure that you\u2019ll be claiming the standard deduction for 2016 but probably will itemize deductions for the 2017 tax year. Reason: You can\u2019t deduct charitable gifts for a year in which you take the standard deduction, as nearly two-thirds of all taxpayers do each year. \u201cIf the person cannot itemize and the charitable contributions aren\u2019t enough when added to the rest of their potential itemized deductions to exceed their standard deduction, they should defer the charitable contribution to the following year,\u201d says Stephen W. DeFilippis, an enrolled agent and owner of DeFilippis Financial Group, a wealth-management and tax firm in Wheaton, Ill.\n\nMany people who itemize may be tempted to prepay state and local taxes this year even though those payments aren\u2019t due until 2017. That can be a great idea\u2014unless you are among the millions of people ensnared by the alternative minimum tax for 2016 and might not be next year. \u201cIf you will be subject to the AMT (for 2016), accelerating these deductions into the current tax year might have no tax benefit,\u201d Mr. DeFilippis says.\n\nDONATING STOCK TO CHARITY: This is a very popular technique among many taxpayers, especially around this time of year. Here is how it typically works: Investors choose shares that they have owned for more than one year and that have risen sharply in value since they purchased them. Donating these \u201chighly appreciated\u201d shares to their favorite charities can be a smart move because it generally enables those taxpayers to deduct the fair market value of the shares and avoid capital gains tax on the long-term profits.\n\nCaution: Don\u2019t make the mistake of donating shares that have declined in value since you purchased them. Instead, consider selling those losers to nail down valuable capital losses. Then, donate the proceeds to charity.\n\nCapital losses can be very valuable for several reasons. Investors can use those losses to soak up capital gains on a dollar-for-dollar limit. When losses exceed gains, or if there are no gains at all, net capital losses typically are deductible up to $3,000 a year (or $1,500 for married people filing separate returns) against other taxable income, including wages. Excess losses are carried over into future years.\n\nNote: If you want to take advantage of this for the 2016 tax year, don\u2019t procrastinate, Mr. Hall says. Donating shares can take time.\n\nWASH SALES: Selling securities at a loss to cancel out capital gains is another popular year-end technique. But to avoid losing the benefits of so-called \u201ctax-loss harvesting,\u201d investors need to pay attention to the \u201cwash-sale\u201d rules.\n\nA wash sale occurs \u201cwhen you sell or trade stock or securities at a loss and within 30 days before or after the sale\u201d you buy \u201csubstantially identical stock or securities,\u201d the IRS says in Publication 550. Note that this rule says \u201c30 days before or after,\u201d not just 30 days after.\n\nA wash sale also occurs when an investor acquires \u201ca contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities\u201d\u2014or when you \u201cacquire substantially identical stock for your individual retirement account or Roth IRA,\u201d the IRS says.\n\nThe IRS mentions another key issue: \u201cIf you sell stock and your spouse or a corporation you control buys substantially identical stock, you also have a wash sale.\u201d\n\nCaution: Note that the rule applies not only to buying the same stock or securities but to stock or securities that are \u201csubstantially identical.\u201d What does that mean? Lawyers say this can be a gray area. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear,\u201d says Mr. Hall of Ropes & Gray.\n\nRENTAL INCOME: Thinking about renting out your home over the holidays? Taxpayers who rent out their homes typically owe tax on the rental income they receive\u2014but not if their total of rentals for the year comes to 14 days or less.\n\nSome wealthy homeowners rent out their homes for exactly 14 days each year. The so-called \u201c14-day rule\u201d is also sometimes known as the \u201cMasters exception,\u201d since it is popular in Augusta, Ga., home of the Masters golf tournament each year.\n\nCaution: Keep good records and don\u2019t exceed 14 days.\n\nDONATIONS FROM IRAS: Late last year, Congress agreed to make permanent a provision designed to encourage taxpayers to donate money to charity directly from their IRAs.\n\nCaution: In Washington, permanent means permanent unless Congress changes its mind.\n\nPREVIOUS TAXES COLUMNS\n\nThis typically allows investors 70\u00bd or older to transfer as much as $100,000 a year directly from an IRA to qualified charities without having to count any of that money as income. If done correctly, the transfer counts toward the taxpayer\u2019s required minimum distribution for that year.\n\nTo be sure, such a transfer doesn\u2019t count as a tax-deductible charitable donation. Even so, it can be a smart move.\n\n\u201cMany taxpayers do not need the income from their RMDs and this provision allows them to direct their RMD to a qualified charity,\u201d says Mr. DeFilippis. The exclusion can \u201cfavorably impact many things such as the taxability of their Social Security benefits and deductibility of medical expenses.\u201d\n\nCaution: The transfer must be done directly from the IRA to a qualified charity. Curiously, donor-advised funds don\u2019t qualify.\n\nJOB SEEKERS: Looking for a new job in your present occupation? Job-hunting expenses, such as travel, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 preparation and outplacement agency fees, may be tax-deductible whether or not you find your dream job.\n\nCaution: Taxpayers can\u2019t deduct job-hunting expenses if looking for work in a \u201cnew occupation,\u201d or if there has been a \u201csubstantial break between the ending of your job and your looking for a new one,\u201d the IRS says. Also, those expenses aren\u2019t deductible if you are \u201clooking for a job for the first time.\u201d See Publication 529 (\u201cMiscellaneous deductions\u201d) for details.\n\nDon\u2019t forget about moving expenses. \u201cMoving expenses for a new job at least 50 miles away from your home may also be deductible,\u201d the IRS says.\n\nGIFT-TAX EXCLUSION: Feeling generous? You can give away as much as $14,000 this year to anyone you want\u2014and to as many people as you wish\u2014without any tax considerations. The giver needn\u2019t file any forms and no tax is owed by anyone (assuming it is a genuine gift and not an attempt to disguise payment for goods or services). The dollar amount will remain $14,000 in 2017.\n\nMr. Herman is a writer in New York City. He was formerly The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Tax Report columnist.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nMore young workers are getting help paying off their student loans from an unlikely source: their employers.\n\nBy making student-loan payments part of a benefits package, a handful of companies are betting the perk will be a good recruiting and retention tool, considering the bulk of bachelor\u2019s degree recipients graduate with student debt these days. Employers offering the benefit so far include accounting and professional-services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, financial-services firm Natixis Global Asset Management and ChowNow, an online food ordering platform. PwC currently offers the benefit in a pilot program but plans to offer it to all employees starting July 1.\n\nBut job applicants beware: Unlike matching gifts that employers will put into a retirement account such as a 401(k), money to help repay student loans is taxable income. There are efforts in Congress to make the perk tax-free. But for now, potential recipients need to do some calculations to determine how much of a benefit they actually would receive after taxes.\n\nThere are other considerations as well. As Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Cappex.com, a college- and scholarship-search site, points out, help with student loans is not the same as simply getting paid more. Some employers cap the amount of debt relief they will provide, which means the extra money will eventually run out. Even when a company is willing to pay off the entire debt, Mr. Kantrowitz says, higher pay might still be a better deal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like having a higher salary because as soon as you run out of debt, you no longer get this benefit,\u201d he says.\n\nStill, Mr. Kantrowitz says he can see young job seekers being swayed by such an offer because it shows a company is focused on their needs.\n\nWell received\n\nIndeed, in a September survey from Iontuition, a website that helps manage student-loan payments, more than half of current students and recent college graduates with student loans said they would rather receive an offer of loan help than a health plan. Nearly half of those surveyed also said they would rather have student-loan help than a 401(k).\n\nCompanies that offer student-loan help typically do so on top of a 401(k) and health insurance. But if workers find themselves in a situation where that\u2019s not the case, they may be better off with the more traditional, tax-free perks. Stashing money in a 401(k) offers \u201cdecades of potential future growth,\u201d Mr. Kantrowitz says, unlike paying off a loan. Of course, he says, if workers don\u2019t have extra money to save for retirement because they\u2019re still making loan payments, that\u2019s another factor to consider.\n\nGenerally, the faster an employer offers to pay off the debt, the better the benefit, Mr. Kantrowitz says, because it keeps interest from accruing on the loan, which ultimately makes it cost more.\n\nFor now, not many employees or job applicants have to think about such things. Only 3% of companies in 2015 offered to help their employees pay off their student loans, according to a survey from the Society for Human Resource Management.\n\nBut the society sees signs that this benefit could become more common. For starters, millennials now account for the largest demographic in the workforce and are likely to begin demanding the benefit, says Bruce Elliott, the society\u2019s manager of compensation and benefits. With the job market recovering, millennials will have more clout when evaluating job offers, he adds.\n\nStartups arriving\n\nMr. Elliott also notes the burgeoning industry of startups offering to help employers manage student-loan repayments. \u201cThat kind of tells me that this could very well be the beginning of a trend,\u201d he says.\n\nAs of late March, one of those startups, Boston-based Gradifi Inc., had 101 companies waiting to launch their own student-loan repayment programs through the Gradifi platform, says Chief Executive Tim DeMello. Gradifi, which worked with PwC on its student-loan perk, sends money deposited by an employer directly to an employee\u2019s student loan servicer. Starting July 1, PwC will put $100 a month toward its employees\u2019 loans, up to a total of $7,200, says Michael Fenlon, global talent leader for PwC.\n\nSimilarly, CommonBond, a lender that specializes in student-loan refinancing, is offering its employees $1,200 a year toward student loans until the worker pays off her debt.\n\nWhen the benefit was announced, one of the first questions was, \u201cHow is this going to be taxed?\u2019 \u201d says CommonBond CEO and co-founder David Klein.\n\nMr. DeMello says some of the companies he works with are giving employees slightly more than the agreed repayment amount to cover the tax bill, although neither PwC nor CommonBond steps up its payments to cover taxes, according to company spokespeople.\n\nStudent Loan Genius, another company that helps employers manage their student loan benefits, unveiled a new option earlier this month that may help to alleviate workers\u2019 tax concerns. With this feature, companies can make a contribution to an employee\u2019s retirement account pretax that\u2019s triggered by a worker\u2019s student-loan payment.\n\nBill in Congress\n\nMeanwhile, companies and employees are looking to Washington for help on this issue.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D., Va.) introduced a bill in Congress in January that would allow employers to put as much as $5,500 a year pretax toward their workers\u2019 student loans. Unlike other legislative proposals for the student-debt crisis\u2014including allowing borrowers to refinance their loans at lower interest rates through the federal government and making two years of community college free\u2014the bill has support from some Republicans. Sens. John Thune (R., S.D.), Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.) and Kelly Ayotte (R., N.H.) co-sponsored the measure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to solve every problem,\u201d Sen. Warner says of the bill. \u201cBut it\u2019s part of a solution that is bipartisan, that\u2019s workable, that we can actually do something on this year, even in an election year.\u201d\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nA previous version of this story incorrectly referred to financial-services firm Natixis Global Asset Management as investment bankers Natixis.

(Example: \u201cCosta Rica: Raptors, Birding and Wildlife.\u201d)\n\nWhen withdrawing from a Roth IRA at retirement, do I need to use any particular forms? Or do I just make a withdrawal?\n\nThe mechanics, in this case, are simple. First, though, make sure you\u2019re familiar with the unique rules involving withdrawals from Roth accounts.\n\nYour account custodian likely has an \u201cIRA Distribution Form\u201d (or something with a similar title) that will need to be filled out. In most cases, the same form is used for withdrawals from various types of individual retirement accounts. Among the information required: the type of distribution (more about this in a moment), the amount to be withdrawn, and where the money should go. A financial adviser should be able to help you with this process, if need be.\n\nLess simple are the rules that cover Roth withdrawals. Take the type of distribution: Is it a \u201cqualified\u201d distribution? (Meaning, at a minimum, that the account is at least five years old.) And what about the funds inside the account? Are they simply contributions that you have made\u2014or does the account also include amounts converted from a traditional IRA or retirement plan? (If so, a withdrawal could be more complicated.)\n\nIf you\u2019re uncertain about these rules, check out, among other resources, rothira.com and irahelp.com.\n\nIllustration: Alison Seiffer for The Wall Street Journal\n\nI have been collecting Social Security benefits for some years now. My wife won't reach retirement age for another seven years. Is it possible for her to claim a spousal benefit until she reaches her retirement age?\n\nThe youngest age at which most people can claim Social Security\u2014whether it\u2019s a benefit based on their own earnings record or a spousal benefit\u2014is 62. (One notable exception: surviving spouses. A widow or widower can claim benefits as early as age 60; a disabled widow or widower can claim as early as age 50.)\n\nSo, if your wife has reached 62, she can file for Social Security. If she hasn\u2019t reached age 62, she wouldn\u2019t be able to collect a spousal benefit while she is waiting to reach her retirement age.\n\nAs I understand it, 2015 contributions to a Roth IRA can be made as late as April 15, 2016. If I transfer money from a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA on April 1, 2016, do I pay federal income taxes on this IRA redemption on my 2015 or 2016 taxes?\n\nYou might be confusing \u201ccontributions\u201d and \u201cconversions,\u201d two concepts that can trip up people at tax time.\n\nLet\u2019s start with contributions. A wrinkle in the tax laws gives people about 15 months to make a contribution to an IRA for a particular tax year. So, for tax year 2015, you have from Jan. 1, 2015, to April 18, 2016, to make a contribution to your Roth. (Normally, the deadline is April 15, the due date for your federal tax return. But the Internal Revenue Service has pushed the filing date this year to April 18.) Depending on your income, the maximum contribution for 2015 is $5,500. People age 50 and older can contribute as much as $6,500.\n\nBy contrast, the deadline for a Roth conversion\u2014a transfer of funds to a Roth from a traditional IRA\u2014is Dec. 31. So, if you transfer money to your Roth on April 1, that transaction (and any tax due) would be reflected on your tax return for 2016.\n\nMy husband and I\u2014ages 66 and 63, respectively\u2014are both retired. My husband claimed his Social Security benefits at age 62. I plan to claim my benefits at my full retirement age of 66. I will be required to go on Medicare at age 65 and pay Medicare premiums. Am I eligible to claim a spousal benefit at age 65 to cover my Medicare premiums, and then claim my own benefits at 66 or later?\n\nShort answer: You can\u2019t do this.\n\nIf you claim benefits at age 65\u2014before your \u201cfull retirement age,\u201d as defined by the Social Security Administration\u2014the agency will look at two numbers: the size of your benefit based on your earnings record, and the size of your spousal benefit (given that your husband is already collecting Social Security). At this point, the agency will automatically award you the larger of those two benefits. Period. You don\u2019t get a say in the matter. And after that determination has been made, you won't be able to switch to a different benefit down the road.\n\nThis is what\u2019s known as the \u201cdeemed filing\u201d rule. In other words, if you apply for benefits before reaching your full retirement age, you are required or \u201cdeemed\u201d to file (according to the Social Security Administration) for all benefits that you might qualify for.\n\nBut\u2026if you wait until your full retirement age of 66, you would have a choice of benefits. You could claim just a spousal benefit and then switch to your benefit (based on your work record) at some point in the future. (Say, age 70.) This would allow your benefit to increase in size, thanks to \u201cdelayed retirement credits.\u201d\n\nThis is known as a \u201crestricted application\u201d\u2014filing for just a spousal benefit at one\u2019s full retirement age. And you are eligible to do this, even under the new Social Security rules. (A person had to reach age 62 before the end of 2015 to be eligible for a restricted application in the future.)\n\nPlanning for retirement can be a daunting process that raises a host of questions.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-people-underestimate-spending-in-retirement-1459130758", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Illustration: Wesley Bedrosian for The Wall Street Journal\n\nIt\u2019s conventional wisdom among financial advisers: People planning to retire should aim to maintain 70% of their current income in retirement.\n\nIt sounds sensible enough. But in reality it can encourage people to underestimate the amount of money that will keep them content in retirement.\n\nThe 70% rule leads us astray because it fails to address the emotional cost of losing 30% of our income. Most people focus on the 70% they will keep, not the spending they will give up. They aren\u2019t prepared for the changes that will be required in their lifestyles. When they eventually are confronted by the specifics they have to cut, they are unhappy. In short, the 70% rule makes the future seem secure and comfortable, even when it\u2019s not.\n\nBehavioral economists refer to this as a framing effect. Similar examples abound in everyday life, as people find choices far more appealing when they are framed in terms of gains rather than losses. For instance, people are more likely to buy ground beef when it\u2019s described as 75% lean rather than 25% fat. They think a condom with a 95% success rate is safe, but are scared of one with a 5% failure rate.\n\nFraming effects can even shape our estimates of longevity. Research by a group led by John Payne, a professor at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business, finds that when people are asked to estimate their lifespan using different frames, they come up with strikingly different answers. In particular, asking subjects if they will \u201clive to\u201d a certain age leads to estimates that are roughly six to nine years longer than asking if they will \u201cdie by\u201d a given age.\n\nWhy? One explanation is the \u201clive to\u201d frame focuses our thoughts on the reasons we might stay alive. When people are given the death frame, by contrast, their minds are naturally drawn to the reasons they might die. Instead of thinking about their healthy exercise habits, they focus on their love of hamburgers.\n\nFraming effects matter because they shape our perceptions of the world and the content of our thoughts. The question hasn\u2019t changed, but the frame can determine how we judge alternatives and what we end up choosing.\n\nSo how can we ensure that framing effects don\u2019t ruin our retirement? Here\u2019s my proposal: Before workers settle on a retirement-savings goal, or decide it\u2019s time to retire, they should undergo a behavioral stress test. In short, they should be asked to identify three expense categories they will cut in retirement, with instructions to be as specific as possible as to what exactly they will cut. These cuts should be significant enough to add up to approximately 30% of their current spending.\n\nIn my experience, while most people find the 70% rule palatable, they find the 30% frame unacceptable. When asked to think specifically about where they would be willing to sacrifice\u2014perhaps dining out, travel, or spoiling the grandchildren\u2014that is when they become more aware of how much they are being asked to give up.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the point of a behavioral stress test.\n\nThe key insight is that people need to be exposed to both gain and loss frames to be able to make realistic decisions about the income they will need in retirement. Behaviorally, neither frame by itself is sufficient. While the gain frame can lead people to underestimate the amount of sacrifice that will be necessary, the loss frame might cause them to think too negatively about the consequences of those sacrifices. Indeed, economic research has shown that big differences in income typically result in minor differences in happiness.\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe behavioral stress test probably will encourage most people to increase their retirement-savings goals, and thus have more income in their later years, allowing them to avoid giving up certain pleasures and activities.\n\nIt is the same for banks when they undergo stress tests in an effort to determine their ability to withstand a financial crisis. The tests help them identify hidden risks and correct mistaken models before it\u2019s too late.\n\nBy considering both gain and loss frames, we can start to figure out what we really want\u2014and what we definitely don\u2019t want to live without.\n\nDr. Benartzi is a professor and co-head of the behavioral decision-making group at UCLA Anderson School of Management, and author of \u201cThe Smarter Screen\u201d about online behavior.

Almost as many as third-grade teachers.\n\nThe movers dropped it. A pipe broke and sprayed water all over it. Somewhere, a dog is likely to have eaten at least one collector\u2019s favorite painting.\n\nBut when it comes to protecting the value of one\u2019s art, the manner in which a piece was damaged doesn\u2019t matter. What matters a thousand\u2014perhaps a million\u2014times more is how the owner can go about restoring the piece\u2019s value\u2014or recouping it if the piece is deemed a total loss.\n\nProtecting art\u2019s financial value isn't as simple as it might seem. There is a \u201cbook\u201d value to your car, which helps insurance companies decide if the cost of repairs will be higher than the overall value of the vehicle. The worth of damaged art, decorative arts and antiques is more elastic and may lead to disputes between owners and insurance companies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a delicate conversation,\u201d says Steven Pincus, president of the New York art brokerage firm DeWitt Stern.\n\nWhat follows is a look at what every art owner should know about damage and restoration in the world of private art collecting, and how owners can best protect their pieces\u2014and pocketbooks:\n\nAssessing the damage\n\nWhen everything goes smoothly, an insurance adjuster will look at the damaged artwork, then a conservator brought in by the insurers will see if the object can be repaired and at what price. Assuming the cost isn\u2019t significantly more than the piece\u2019s value, the artwork is quickly handed over to the conservator to begin treatment.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want a long delay, because that could make problems much worse or even permanent,\u201d says Dorit Straus, retired world-wide fine art manager at Chubb, a leading fine art insurer.\n\nAfter repairs are made, an appraiser with expertise in fine art or a dealer in the particular type of art will evaluate the object to determine if the value of the now-repaired work\u2019s value has declined and by how much.\n\nThis is where the difficulties can start.\n\n\u201cThere is no mathematical formula,\u201d says Chicago-based insurance adjuster Robert O\u2019Connell. \u201cIt can be a small tear in a canvas, but it matters more if the tear is at the center of the painting or at the edge.\u201d\n\nA fine-arts insurance policy generally will cover the entire cost of restoration and, if there is, say, a 30% loss of value because of the damage, the insurer will pay the policyholder 30% of the insured value.\n\nWhen there are disagreements about values submitted by an appraiser for the insurance company and another by the policyholder, many fine-art-insurance policies have arbitration clauses that bring in a third appraiser to assess both valuations.\n\nWith heavily damaged older artworks, the insurance industry\u2019s fine-art appraiser or expert may choose not to say that an object has been destroyed, \u201cunless it is no longer recognizable,\u201d says Chubb\u2019s Ms. Straus. \u201cEven heavily damaged works may retain cultural significance, although determining what that works out to in actual dollars isn't easy.\u201d\n\nDeciding if a work can be repaired and if it retains any value can be further complicated when the artist is still living. Some artists may offer to repair their own works or want to select and supervise a conservator, while others might hold the view that their creations would never be the same, demanding that their names not be associated with the artworks.\n\nMedium matters\n\nThe success of restoration efforts can sometimes depend on the medium.\n\n\u201cPhotographs are exceedingly difficult to repair,\u201d says Albert Albano, executive director of the Intermuseum Conservation Association in Cleveland. \u201cOnce the homogenous surface has been disturbed, the damage is extremely difficult to camouflage, leading to a noticeable decline in aesthetic value.\u201d That presumably will affect market value as well.\n\nWith paintings, on the other hand, conservation may be done so well that damage won't adversely affect the piece\u2019s fair market value. It depends on the type of treatment (a cleaning often is relatively minor while relining a canvas is significant), the amount of restoration necessary and the methods used.\n\nPhoto: Iakov Filimonov/iStock/Getty Images\n\nBuyers beware\n\nFor owners of a once-damaged but now restored work, the piece\u2019s resale value can be of greater interest than its insurance value.\n\nPast efforts at restoration generally aren't immediately apparent to the naked eye, as conservators try to make their work and that of the underlying art seamless. There is no Carfax for works of art, no place to go for reports of hidden damage and repairs.\n\nAt auction houses large and small, objects are sold \u201cas is.\u201d Sotheby\u2019s conditions of sale suggest that \u201c[p]rospective bidders should inspect the property before bidding to determine its condition, size, and whether or not it has been repaired or restored.\u201d\n\nBoth Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s will provide condition reports on request for individual lots, but they tend to be very brief and full of disclaimers.\n\nAccording to New York City gallery owner Michael Rosenfeld, \u201cFew collectors ask if the paintings they are interested in buying were ever restored. I don\u2019t think it crosses their minds.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t care once they find out, however, which is why Mr. Rosenfeld says he makes a point of discussing the condition of a work of art with prospective buyers.\n\nSome collectors might want to make their own determinations. Repairs often will show under a black light, a hand-held device emitting a low-magnitude ultraviolet radiation that causes certain materials to fluoresce. Materials applied later won\u2019t glow as much. Some collectors purchase ultraviolet lights, while others will bring in a conservator to examine artworks under consideration.\n\nOnce collectors learn about any restoration, Mr. Rosenfeld says, some lose interest, while others use the information as leverage to negotiate a lower price.\n\nMr. Grant is a writer living in Amherst, Mass.

Hospital officials say art improves the physical and therapeutic environment for patients, their families and staff. \u201cStudies have shown that artwork helps to reduce stress and boredom, reduces blood pressure and increases white-blood-cell count, all of which are factors in the healing process,\u201d says Jessica R. Finch, art program manager at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. The hospital has been building a collection\u2014now reaching 5,000 pieces\u2014since 1996, she says.\n\nOne of its most significant pieces is a ceiling-hung glass work by Seattle artist Dale Chihuly. \u201cIt was from a corporate art collection,\u201d says Ms. Finch. \u201cThe corporation couldn\u2019t sell it, because it was so large, and offered it to us.\u201d\n\nDonors of artwork to hospitals often have a personal connection to the institution. Ms. Gans\u2019s three children were born at Cedars-Sinai, and her husband has served on several boards at the facility. Its collection, established in 1976, has more than 4,500 artworks, says the curator, John T. Lange. \u201cI like the hospital\u2019s belief that people there should have something nice to look at, and I wanted to support that,\u201d Ms. Gans says.\n\nTax considerations\n\nSuch gifts typically involve tax considerations for the donors, and certain rules that must be followed to maximize the tax benefits. In order for a donor to receive a deduction for the full-fair-market value of a gift, for example, the recipient organization must show that its use of the artwork is related to its tax-exempt purpose. If there is no related use, the donor\u2019s deduction will be limited to his or her cost basis for the artwork.\n\n\u2018Dandelion Seed,\u2019 a kinetic sculpture by Bill Wainwright, was donated to the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital by a collector. Photo: Jessica R. Finch\n\nAnother consideration should be whether a recipient might quickly resell a donated artwork. According to IRS regulations, if the recipient charity sells the donated item within three years, the donor\u2019s tax deduction is changed from fair market value to the taxpayer\u2019s original buying price, which most often is lower. The purpose of this rule is to insure that the charity actually wants the donation and is not simply enabling a sizable deduction for a taxpayer.\n\nSecurity concerns\n\nDonors also may want to know that their gifts will be protected and cared for by the recipient. Some institutions have separate fine-art insurance policies that cover damage and theft. Others, such as Hebrew Home at Riverdale, a nursing home in New York\u2019s Bronx borough that was founded in 1917, cover their art and other building contents under a blanket building policy.\n\nSecurity at a hospital or nursing home tends to be directed at patient safety, not the protection of artwork present. But reports of damage and theft are rare, and other precautions are often taken.\n\nHebrew Home, for its part, doesn\u2019t install any artworks in its Alzheimer\u2019s wing, as patients \u201cdon\u2019t have the same filters as other people and may try to touch or smear it,\u201d says Daniel Reingold, president and chief executive officer of RiverSpring Health, which operates the facility.\n\nExtreme values\n\nFor very valuable artworks, an art museum still might be the most appropriate recipient of a donation, and if not a major city museum then perhaps a regional institution or a college museum.\n\nJennifer Finkel, art curator at the Cleveland Clinic, a nonprofit, academic medical center based in Cleveland, Ohio, oversees a collection of 6,000 objects throughout that organization. Ms. Finkel says that \u201ca Picasso painting wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for us. It might be too fragile or too valuable, and we want to be responsible for the works in our collection.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, when a piece that has been donated to Cleveland Clinic increases dramatically in value, it can be a very welcome event.\n\nMs. Finkel recalls a Milton Avery painting donated to the hospital back in the 1950s. Some 30 years later, its value had risen to such a degree that when the hospital decided to sell it, she says, the proceeds paid \u201cto furnish an entire new building with art.\u201d\n\nMr. Grant is a writer in Amherst, Mass.

No doubt, many collectors assume that such a list represents a kind of agreement, that those on the list are part of an orderly process that gives them a much better chance of obtaining a highly desired artwork the next time it comes on the market.\n\nOccasionally it does work that way. But caveat collector.\n\nWaiting lists primarily help galleries and dealers sort through prospective buyers, prioritize relationships and maintain control over the markets of their artists. Indeed, the lists are far from first-come, first-served.\n\nMuseums top the list, because inclusion in an institution\u2019s permanent collection elevates an artist\u2019s standing\u2014and, thus, worth. Collectors with ties to museums (a trustee, or board member) also sit at the top of the list because they are likely to donate some or all of their artworks to those institutions. Long-term clients of the dealer, of course, rank highly as well.\n\nOccasionally, a gallery will favor someone on the list who is a newer client who may be building a collection.\n\n\u201cWe always are looking for new collectors,\u201d says Michael Smoler, director of the Blum & Poe art gallery in Los Angeles. \u201cNo gallery can survive on just selling to the same few people.\u201d Collectors who are new to a gallery, or even perhaps to art collecting, may not get a specific work by that hot artist on the first try. But dealers do look to inaugurate new relationships, Mr. Smoler says.\n\nFor someone new to collecting, being put on a waiting list can help them build a relationship with a gallery or dealer. But, in turn, they can expect lots of questions for the privilege. Waiting lists contain pages of notes about buyers, identifying not just who they are, but what they buy and what they are looking for.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to know who the buyers are,\u201d says Helene Winer, co-owner of Metro Pictures in Manhattan. \u201cWho else do they buy from and what do they own? Are they part of a museum? How often do they buy? Do they work with an adviser and, if so, who is that person?\u201d\n\nFor the unsuspecting, waiting lists also can be a danger in the hands of unscrupulous dealers. Some galleries may try to get people to buy their way onto and up a list, using the list \u201cas a weapon, or a negotiating tool,\u201d says Marc Glimcher, president of New York\u2019s Pace Gallery.\n\nPhoto: iStock/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThey may make you buy works by other artists they represent, pieces they haven\u2019t been able to sell and which you may not like,\u201d Mr. Glimcher says. \u201cThey may say, \u2018We\u2019ll let you buy a work you want, but you\u2019ll also have to buy one to donate to a museum, and we\u2019ll tell you which museum.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe art trade can be an unsavory business at times. Mr. Glimcher advises prospective collectors who are on a waiting list \u201cnot to buy something you don\u2019t like. It doesn\u2019t do anything for the buyer or the buyer\u2019s relationship with the gallery, and it doesn\u2019t help the artist.\u201d\n\nCollectors who refuse such proposals, he adds, may not be offered the next work that becomes available.\n\nMr. Grant is a writer in Amherst, Mass.

Above, a chair from 1953. Photo: Dan Stasser/Baxter & Liebchen\n\n\u201cMad Men\u201d has come and gone, but demand for furniture from the mid-20th century continues.\n\nPrices of chairs, tables, sofas and other pieces, particularly those of Scandinavian origin, from the late 1940s through the early 1960s have increased dramatically in recent years and show no sign of falling soon, experts say.\n\n\u201cMidcentury furniture is really important for us,\u201d says Anna Brockway, the president and co-founder of Chairish, a curated online marketplace for used and vintage furniture. \u201cWe see a strong interest in Scandinavian cabinetry,\u201d she adds. Three years ago, prices were half of what they are now, or even less, she says.\n\nInterest in midcentury furniture was sparked years ago by connoisseurs drawn to its simplicity, sleekness and craftwork, says Ms. Brockway, who adds that interest got a further boost from the television series \u201cMad Men,\u201d which employed sets carefully constructed from original period pieces.\n\nPrice check\n\nAndrew Kevelson, owner of Baxter & Liebchen, a vintage furniture dealer in New York, says the run-up in values of Scandinavian furniture in recent years reflects an increase in overall real-estate activity, which in turn has driven a demand for furniture. The economy has been strong enough to drive the auction market for high-end furnishings and artwork to new highs, he says.\n\nCollectors who buy now shouldn\u2019t expect a quick return on their investment, however. Recent rapid increases notwithstanding, Ms. Brockway cautions that \u201cyou will have to stick with this for a really long time\u201d to see further dramatic increases in prices in such furniture.\n\nA Borge Mogensen easy chair from 1955. Photo: Baxter & Liebchen\n\nMr. Kevelson agrees that the recent pace of increase may not continue. But he expects prices for mid-20th century furniture to keep rising, partly due to shrinking supplies over time.\n\n\u201cFifteen-plus years ago, most people went to antiques for high-end furnishings,\u201d Mr. Kevelson says. \u201cI think the trend to go to quality, mid-century furnishings for high-end d\u00e9cor is here to stay for a long time.\u201d\n\nChris Mitchell, publisher and chief revenue officer of Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s Vanity Fair magazine, has collected mid-20th century Scandinavian furniture for the past 10 years.\n\n\u201cWhat I love about the Danish stuff is the delicateness,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is unmatched. I am talking about a level of craftsmanship you could not touch today. Nobody is making this. It is modern, but also very warm.\u201d\n\nMr. Mitchell says his only regret is not buying more such furniture when it was more affordable. He says he once passed on a daybed by Danish designer Poul Kjaerholm, because of the $8,000 price. The piece now sells for about $18,000, he says.\n\nWhat to look for\n\nCollectors buying for investment value should give preference to pieces that have original labels, and make sure not to remove them. Labels can add dramatically to a piece\u2019s value, especially when it is in mint condition.\n\nDesirable design features include curvaceous organic forms, \u201cdetails that do more than obvious functionality, that took extra effort to construct,\u201d Mr. Kevelson says. Danish craftsmen of the period used hardwoods such as rosewood and wenge that had been air-dried for as long as 50 years. That produced a super hard material that doesn\u2019t twist or crack, even as it is bent into extremely challenging shapes.\n\nScandinavian furniture from the mid-20th century is about craftsmanship as much as design, according to William Lee, founder of Modernlink furniture in New York. The Danish cabinet makers of the period spent as much as a decade studying their craft as an academic discipline, Mr. Lee says. Many of the pieces these craftsmen produced were made in small runs of 150 to 200 units, which helps boost their value in today\u2019s market, he adds.\n\nStandout designers\n\nMr. Lee\u2019s favorite designers of the period include Jacob Kjaer, a Danish furniture designer and cabinet maker. One of his chairs might now cost $10,000 to $50,000, in Mr. Lee\u2019s opinion. Five years ago, a collector might have found a great piece for $5,000, or even $3,000, he says.\n\nA pair of Finn Juhl lounge chairs from the 1940s or 1950s, in good condition, would cost about $30,000, according to Mr. Kevelson. Three years ago, a set would have cost $20,000 to $25,000, he says. Age, condition, patina and provenance will effect price, he advises.\n\nIf a Finn Juhl lounge chair is out of reach, take heart in the fact that hundreds of designers and cabinet makers were active in this period.\n\n\u201cThey made beautiful things,\u201d Mr. Lee says. \u201cThe work they produced was just mind-blowing.\u201d\n\nMr. Rosenbush is the editor of CIO Journal in New York.

Photo: Sam Deitch/BFA\n\nLooking at art is generally a quiet, contemplative affair. Except, that is, at international art fairs, where \u201cthe scene sometimes feels like panic shopping on Black Friday,\u201d says Gretchen Berggruen, co-owner of San Francisco\u2019s John Berggruen Gallery, a participant in half a dozen art fairs a year.\n\nReal dangers lurk for both inexperienced and veteran buyers at these well-heeled but intense events, where a rapidly increasing percentage of gallery sales take place. Indeed, in the typically competitive frenzy of trying to buy something before someone else does, experts say, it can be easy to not ask enough questions, buy too quickly and pay too much.\n\n\u201cArt fairs do make me nervous sometimes,\u201d says John Cahill, a lawyer specializing in art in New York City, where tens of thousands attended the Art Show and the Armory Show in March, just two of the 10 art fairs held in New York that month. Mr. Cahill says when his clients go to art fairs, they \u201coften buy things quickly, without the due diligence they might apply when buying elsewhere, because they feel the competition. Their hearts rule their minds.\u201d\n\nHere are some tips from art advisers and lawyers on how buyers can explore the growing international art-fair scene while not losing their head, or their money.\n\nCall ahead. The main problem for fair visitors is having almost no time to ponder a previously unseen work or negotiate with the dealer without having other potential buyers literally breathing down one\u2019s neck.\n\n\u201cBuyers don\u2019t have the luxury of time and the ability to negotiate,\u201d says Judd Grossman, a New York City attorney specializing in art law. \u201cIf a prospective buyer starts raising a lot of questions, dealers are apt to say, \u2018I have five other people next in line who will be less difficult to deal with.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSome experts advise buyers to contact dealers ahead of a fair to find out what works they plan to bring and what prices they will charge. Some dealers will be willing to haggle already, the experts say. Early contact also provides more opportunity to discuss such details as whether a piece is an important work by the artist, part of a series, or whether it has ever been restored.\n\nTake a contract. Mr. Cahill says that when his collector-clients go to art fairs, he gives them boilerplate contracts for the dealer to sign if a purchase is made. While details such as a work\u2019s title, name of the artist and price can be filled in at the fair, these ready-made contracts clearly spell out terms about title, condition, authenticity, export restrictions and payment.\n\n\u201cA clause might indicate that the sale is subject to a conservator examining the work,\u201d Mr. Cahill says. \u201cAnother clause would say that the sale is subject to having an expert confirm that the work is authentic.\u201d\n\nThe aim of the contract, the lawyer says, is \u201cto slow the process down, to allow yourself to get out of a bad deal.\u201d\n\nAmong the many other conditions a contract can stipulate: It might make a sale contingent on a search of stolen-art databases, or feature a clause that negates the sale if the host country tries to block the artwork\u2019s export.\n\nHold something back. Another way to slow down the process is to ask for a desired piece to be put on hold for a day (or even half a day). A delay can help the buyer see if the attraction lasts, or if it is just an infatuation. It can also give the buyer more time to do his or her homework.\n\nAs New York art lawyer William Pearlstein recommends, \u201cSay, \u2018I\u2019ll take it, subject to my lawyer sending you a purchase agreement,\u2019 which allows a little time for some due diligence to take place.\u201d\n\nSaying you\u2019ll buy a masterpiece and actually paying for it are two very different things. A verbal \u201cI\u2019ll buy it\u201d may not constitute a legally enforceable contract. This can backfire, though. Dealers who claim that they will hold an artwork for a few hours or a day may not be held liable if they decide to sell the work to someone else in the meantime.\n\nPut a little down. Dealers may be more willing to actually keep the artwork on hold if the collector puts down a refundable deposit of 5% or 10%, with an agreement to wire the rest over the course of 30 days. In the absence of a more detailed contract, this may work both to hold the piece while you think it over, and give you more time to perform due diligence.\n\nMr. Cahill says he tells his clients to seek as much as 30 days to complete a payment. \u201cDealers generally want their money faster than that,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Grant is a writer living in Amherst, Mass.

Photo: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg News\n\nThis fall isn\u2019t shaping up to be the best of times for art auction houses. Which means it may be a very good time for people looking to sell their works of art.\n\nWeakness in the British pound, the euro and petroleum prices are all expected to take their toll on bids in the November sales of impressionist, modern and contemporary art in New York City. The U.S. elections in November, too, are causing some to worry that the market that month could be weak.\n\nPhilip Hoffman, founder and chief executive officer of the London-based Fine Art Group, a private-equity firm specializing in artworks, fears as much as a 30% drop in works offered for sale in November at the Christie\u2019s, Phillips and Sotheby\u2019s auction houses in New York.\n\nBut what sellers sitting on the fence need to know is, the art auction houses have lots of incentives that can sweeten the terms for collectors who are willing to sell valuable pieces in uncertain times.\n\nTo test the waters, experts advise contacting more than one auction house to learn what they are willing to offer. The more valuable and rare the object, the more sellers can bargain.\n\n\u201cI use all the tools available to me to get important consignments,\u201d says Peter Loughrey, president of Los Angeles Modern Auctions. \u201cAt $1 million, I offer crazy incentives.\u201d\n\nIt also may be advisable to ask an art adviser to handle the actual negotiations with auction houses.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the incentives that upscale auction houses are often willing to offer when their cupboards start to look a little less well-stocked:\n\nGuarantees: An auction house will sometimes commit to paying the individual who is selling, known as the consignor, an agreed-upon amount\u2014regardless of whether the artwork actually sells. In effect, the auctioneer is buying the consignment, guaranteeing the seller, say, $4 million for the painting that has been valued at $4 million. If the auction house doesn't sell the picture, or sells it for less than $4 million, the company eats the loss.\n\nPerformance bonus: Consignors can ask\u2014but only ahead of time\u2014for a cut of what the auction house charges the buyer as a premium. The premium may be 25%, 20% or 12% of the final sale price at both Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s. The higher the sale price, the lower the percentage. If it is made part of the agreement, a work that sells for more than expected may trigger an extra payment to the consignor. That money comes out of the purchaser\u2019s premium as well.\n\nAuctioneer\u2019s commission: Auction houses earn money from both buyers and sellers, and consignors of desirable items may seek a reduction or even elimination of the commission, which is sometimes as high as 30%. \u201cWhen you know there is competition with other auction houses, the first place you cave is with commissions,\u201d says Leslie Hindman, owner of Chicago-based Leslie Hindman Auctioneers.\n\nFees: Auction houses regularly charge an array of fees for services including photography, transportation, storage, insurance and marketing. All of these fees may be waived if the auction wants the consignment enough.\n\nAdd-ons: Consignors can ask for good positioning in the sale catalog\u2014even for placement on the cover. A separate catalog, or a catalog-within-a-catalog can be a possibility if the seller has a number of noted items. Consignors also may ask the auction house to advertise the sale (and the specific consignment) in various media and to promote the particular objects in a special\u2014possibly even touring\u2014exhibition.\n\nMr. Grant is a writer in Amherst, Mass.

Photo: Balloon Dog (Blue), 2002, Jeff Koons/ARTNET\n\nBidding for art online has some clear advantages for collectors. But it also has some risks that might not be so apparent until it is too late.\n\nThe advantages\u2014the ability to participate in auctions around the world without having to travel, and having previously inaccessible art at your fingertips\u2014are attracting more collectors. Online purchases of art from galleries and at auctions totaled an estimated $3.27 billion last year, up 24% from 2014, with about two-thirds of those sales at auctions in both years, according to an April report from British insurer Hiscox. It expects online gallery and auction sales to total close to $10 billion a year by 2020. That includes online purchases made at auctions held at brick-and-mortar sites and at auctions held online only.\n\nBut the risks are substantial. Bidders often buy an item without having seen it in person. What\u2019s more, at online-only auctions they often have limited information about the item and little opportunity to research it\u2014as well as limited recourse if something turns out not to be what they expected. That increases the risk of overpaying, legal complications concerning ownership, or falling victim to fraud.\n\n\u201cI have found things online that I can\u2019t find in brick-and-mortar galleries or auction houses,\u201d says Wendy Cromwell, an art adviser based in New York. \u201dYou go where you find what you want.\u201d But she advises collectors to exercise caution. \u201cOnline-only auctions are much more opaque than those at brick-and-mortar auction houses,\u201d she says, so to be safe, collectors have to make the effort to verify as much information as possible about the items they bid on.\n\nHiscox identified 80 online bidding platforms for art and included in its report a ranking of the top 40 in terms of their traffic and sales as well as visitor and buyer satisfaction. The top 40 include some auction houses\u2019 proprietary sites (Christie\u2019s LIVE, Sotheby\u2019s BIDnow, Heritage Auctions\u2019 Heritage Live), third-party platforms that allow buyers to bid at sales at a variety of brick-and-mortar auctioneers (such as Bidsquare, Invaluable and eBay) and purely online auction sites that hold their own sales (including Artnet and Paddle8).\n\nThere is some overlap. For instance, a collector can bid for items at a sale at Dallas-based Heritage Auctions through Heritage Live and third-party platforms Invaluable, LiveAuctioneers and Bidsquare. Auctions held at New York\u2019s Swann Galleries are accessible online through Invaluable and eBay; Swann doesn\u2019t have its own online bidding platform.\n\nA lesser risk\n\nBidding online for items being auctioned at brick-and-mortar sites is less risky than online-only bidding. The big auction houses generally provide more information about the items they handle than online-only auctioneers do, and they offer that information further ahead of the auction date. And the auction houses generally provide more protection if there is a problem with an artwork a collector buys.\n\nFor instance, Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s will refund a buyer\u2019s money up to five years after the sale if it turns out the item wasn\u2019t created by the artist credited in the sale. They also will refund the buyer\u2019s money up to four years after the sale if any legal problems concerning the seller\u2019s ownership of the item arise. Online-only auctioneers generally provide those protections for only a few weeks, sometimes less.\n\nHowever, there are still some disadvantages to bidding online at auction-house sales. For one, the auction houses generally don\u2019t offer protection for the condition of the items being auctioned\u2014everything is sold as-is. Online bidders who haven\u2019t seen an item in person and don\u2019t have someone on the scene to look it over may be at a disadvantage in spotting subtle flaws.\n\nAlso, buyers usually pay a higher premium to third-party platforms than the auction houses themselves charge for each sale.\n\nInformation gap\n\nThe risks increase with the purely online auction sites. It isn\u2019t only that bidders can\u2019t see the items for sale in person. The operators of these sites themselves seldom see the objects, except as digital photos sent to them as JPEG files by sellers along with descriptions, which are then posted with starting bid prices and deadlines for when the sale will be completed, usually just a few days after posting.\n\nCollectors interested in online-only auctions can email questions about items to the auction site, which passes them on to the seller. At Artnet, after a sale, a buyer has seven days to return an item if it is not as described on the site, says Artnet auction administrator Noah Phillips. \u201cHowever, if the work is inauthentic, the buyer has 30 days,\u201d he says. If Artnet determines a complaint has merit, it will rescind the sale and refund the buyer\u2019s money. Paddle8, which also conducts online-only auctions, will consider rescinding a sale if a buyer reports a problem within 30 days after receiving an item.\n\nThose time limits mean buyers need to immediately examine, or have experts examine, the objects they purchase online to validate their authenticity, condition and if they can be sold legally. Paddle8 co-founder Aditya Julka explains that \u201cwe release funds to the seller quickly, in 45 days, so we cannot allow buyers to waste time if they have a problem.\u201d\n\nAn incomplete picture\n\nAnother issue for collectors to be aware of is that online-only auctioneers generally don\u2019t report lots that don\u2019t sell, unlike brick-and-mortar auction houses. That may make it more difficult for collectors to value an unsold object that comes up for auction again later, or to value similar objects, since those valuations are based largely on what someone paid or wouldn\u2019t pay for objects at recent auctions.\n\n\u201cNot revealing whether an item did not sell obscures the whole process,\u201d says Kathryn Graddy, an economics professor at Brandeis University.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nShould repayment of student loans be a family affair?\n\nThat\u2019s a question many baby-boomer parents are wrestling with as they watch their young-adult children struggle to pay off college debt in an era of sluggish wage growth and high rents.\n\nParents increasingly are expressing a desire to help. Indeed, more than 60% of parents say they are very or somewhat likely to help their children repay student debt, according to a May survey from Discover Student Loans, a unit of Discover Bank.\n\nBut financial experts say just because parents can alleviate some of a child\u2019s financial burden doesn\u2019t mean they should. While providing help could give some young adults the financial room they need to get a fledgling career off the ground, it also could put parents\u2019 retirement at risk, especially if the parents dig into their nest eggs for the money. What\u2019s more, without the proper guard rails, parental help could enable an adult child\u2019s poor financial management or worse, sour the relationship.\n\nHere are some ways parents can reduce a child\u2019s student-loan burden, while still holding the young adult accountable:\n\nLump-sum payment\n\nFor parents who can afford it, paying off a chunk of a child\u2019s student loans in a lump sum can provide the most immediate benefit to a young adult struggling to pay the bills, says Pam Capalad, a financial planner at Brunch & Budget, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based financial-planning firm. Reducing the principal on a student loan can stop the interest from building and the balance from growing.\n\nFamilies who decide on this approach should be sure to provide clear instructions to the loan servicer about how they want the lump-sum payment applied, she says. For students with multiple loans, it may make the most sense to target the one with the highest interest rate or the one with the lowest balance, she says.\n\nParents who want to emphasize financial responsibility could structure the lump-sum payment as a loan to the child, complete with the provisions of a traditional agreement, says Jennifer Myers, president of SageVest Wealth Management in McLean, Va. If the child has some assets, parents could even consider collateralizing the loan, so they have something to take if they aren\u2019t repaid, she says.\n\n\u201cThis isn't just when you get a bonus you can send me a check,\u201d Ms. Myers says.\n\nSome parents may want to hold off on the lump-sum payment until they see that their child has made a good-faith effort to pay off the debt themselves.\n\nFor Melanie Lockert, 32, the author of \u201cDear Debt: A Story About Breaking Up With Debt,\u201d the $4,000 her mom gave her toward the end of her loan-repayment journey helped give her the push she needed to become debt free.\n\nMs. Lockert, a freelance writer and event planner, scrimped on gym memberships, drinks and other luxuries for several years to aggressively pay off her student loans. She also baby-sat and took other side jobs to afford the payments. Her mom then surprised her daughter by giving her a portion of a bonus she earned at work.\n\nMs. Lockert says her mom had seen her \u201cwork tirelessly\u201d for several years to pay off her student loans, so she knew the money would be put to good use.\n\nOf course, long-term incentives may not work for borrowers who are struggling to manage regular payments, says Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of Cappex.com, a college and scholarship search site.\n\nHe suggests a shorter incentive period\u2014for example, parents could offer to make the 12th loan payment if the child makes 11 in a row.\n\n\u201cDelayed gratification is difficult not just for little kids, it\u2019s difficult for adults,\u201d he says.\n\nContribute monthly\n\nFor parents who can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to provide their offspring with a lump-sum payment, temporarily taking over the young adult\u2019s monthly student-loan payments is another way to provide help.\n\nEric Roberge, a Boston-based financial planner, says this arrangement allows recent graduates in precarious financial situations to resume making the payments once their finances have stabilized.\n\nBeverly Nance, a 55-year-old retired postal worker who lives in Stockbridge, Ga., is currently paying her son\u2019s $275 monthly student-loan payment while he searches for a full-time job. Her son, Troy Jenkins, just finished an unpaid internship that could help him get his foot in the door in his desired field of sports communications. She says that without her help, Troy may not have been able to take the internship.\n\nTroy Jenkins\u2019 mother has been helping with student-loan payments so he could take a unpaid internship. Photo: Village Photographers\n\nMs. Nance says she and her son have an understanding that he will take over the payments once he gets a job and has a few paychecks under his belt. She says their handshake deal is underpinned by the fact that her son is eager to be out on his own and covering his own expenses.\n\n\u201cMy advice would be: If you can help, then be a help,\u201d Ms. Nance says. \u201cA lot of people think that people\u2019s characters form by struggling. I just don\u2019t believe that.\u201d\n\nMr. Roberge and other financial planners say it\u2019s important for parents to discuss the terms of such contributions ahead of time and ask their children to estimate when they think they can take over loan payments. Then, he says, check in regularly to make sure the child is making progress toward taking over the payments by the desired deadline.\n\nAnother option is for parents to set an income threshold for their childrens\u2019 contributions and start phasing out assistance gradually as the young adult approaches that mark, says Mr. Kantrowitz.\n\nTypically, student debt is considered unaffordable if the total exceeds annual income, so parents could offer to pay the student loans until the child\u2019s income exceeds his or her debt. Alternatively, parents could require their young adults to put 10% of their monthly income toward their debt\u2014generally a metric that means student debt is considered affordable\u2014with the parents paying the difference between that amount and the monthly loan payment.\n\nIt\u2019s like their version of the government\u2019s income-based repayment plans, which cap monthly payments at a percentage of a borrower\u2019s income, says James Kinney, a Bridgewater, N.J.-based financial planner. The most generous federal programs cap payments at 10% of a borrower\u2019s discretionary income.\n\nProvide matching funds\n\nParents who want to incentivize their children to get rid of student debt quickly could take the 401(k) approach and offer a loan-payment match, says Mr. Kantrowitz. \u201cIf they pay extra, you\u2019ll pay extra.\u201d\n\nFinancial planners say parents who favor this strategy should set guidelines, such as the ratio of the matching funds and any conditions for withdrawal of support, such as if the child misses or is late on a certain number of loan payments.\n\nMr. Kantrowitz suggests writing out a contract that also includes conditions for possible termination of the arrangement, such as if a parent suffers a job loss.\n\nFocus on private loans\n\nIf a young adult has both federal and private loans, it probably makes sense for parents to help with the private loans and let the child repay the federal debt, says Ms. Capalad.\n\nThe federal government offers borrowers options for managing their debts, including the ability to cap payments as a percentage of their income, so \u201cthat\u2019s the easiest and most beneficial one for them to be responsible for,\u201d she says.\n\nPrivate student loans, on the other hand, often have higher interest rates and offer few protections against hard times, which means it may be difficult for a borrower with a low income to stay current on the loans without help. What\u2019s more, parents often cosign their students\u2019 private loans, so their credit is also at risk if the child defaults.\n\nOf course, borrowers should keep in mind that an income-driven repayment plan stretches out the loan, meaning in many cases they will end up paying more in total than if they had they repaid the debt under the standard 10-year repayment plan. Still, the federal government does offer loan forgiveness after at least 10 years of payments for public servants and at least 20 years of payments for all borrowers.\n\nThings to keep in mind\n\nHere are a few things parents should keep in mind, regardless of what student-loan payment strategy they choose.\n\n\u2014 Any contributions to a student loan that is in the child\u2019s name only is subject to a gift tax if it\u2019s more than $14,000 annually from an individual or more than $28,000 from a married couple, says financial-aid expert Mark Kantrowitz. That\u2019s true even if the payments are made directly to the student-loan servicer. But payments made to a private loan a parent cosigned aren't subject to the gift-tax maximum, he says.\n\n\u2014 Borrowers repaying student loans can offset some of the cost through a tax deduction, but only those who actually owe the loan can claim it, says Mr. Kantrowitz. So if a parent helps pay off a loan that is only in the child\u2019s name, they can\u2019t claim the tax deduction. Only the child can.\n\n\u2014 Families typically can and should work with their child\u2019s student-loan servicer to make payments on the debt instead of providing their child with cash.\n\nMs. Berman is a reporter at MarketWatch in New York.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/four-financial-gifts-to-consider-for-the-holidays-1481512322", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Illustration: Matthew Hollister for The Wall Street Journal\n\nForget about buying your loved ones sweaters or gadgets this holiday season. Instead, consider giving a financial gift.\n\nNot cash or a check stuffed in an envelope. Think of gifts that can help a person save for college or deal with a big expense, or teach them how to manage their money more effectively. Some gifts may even help the giver save on taxes.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at four financial gifts to consider:\n\n1. Buy time with a professional\n\nRecent graduates, new parents or the soon-to-be-retired may all benefit from a session or two with a financial planner.\n\nA planner can help them evaluate their current financial situation and set goals for the future. Jane Young, co-owner of It\u2019s Not Just Money Inc., a financial advisory firm in Colorado Springs, Colo., says several clients have paid her to consult for a few hours with a relative as a gift.\n\nWhile Ms. Young doesn\u2019t provide actual gift certificates, some financial planners do offer gift certificates or hourly planning packages. Ann Minnium, founder of Concierge Financial Planning LLC in Scotch Plains, N.J., offers gift certificates starting at $500, which covers two hours of planning advice.\n\n2. Help fund a college education\n\nAdding to a student\u2019s 529 college-savings account can be a big help, says James Miller, president of Woodward Financial Advisers Inc. in Chapel Hill, N.C. Contributions grow tax-deferred and withdrawals are tax-free for qualified college costs.\n\nIndividuals can contribute up to $14,000 a year to a 529 without triggering the gift tax. All plans accept third-party contributions, and there is no limit to how many 529 plans one can contribute to annually, says Mark Kantrowitz, a financial-aid expert and publisher of Cappex.com, a college scholarship and search site.\n\nIndividuals also can contribute up to five years\u2019 worth of gifts at once. For example, you could put as much as $70,000 into a child\u2019s 529 account this year without paying a gift tax. However, you wouldn\u2019t be able to make any more financial gifts to the child for the next five years without triggering the gift tax.\n\nThe giver may be able to receive a state income tax deduction on the contributions, depending on the state 529 plan, Mr. Miller says.\n\n3. Pay a bill\n\nIf a loved one is facing a big bill, offer to pay some or all of the expense directly. Unlimited payments can be made directly to a medical provider or educational institution on behalf of others. One could pay a friend\u2019s out-of-pocket medical expenses or a grandchild\u2019s college-tuition bill. One thing to keep in mind: Ask the school if making such a payment will affect the student\u2019s need-based aid; it may be reduced depending on the school\u2019s policy.\n\nAs long the payment is made directly to the service provider, the amount won\u2019t affect the donor\u2019s lifetime federal estate-tax exemption amount of $5.45 million. It also won\u2019t count toward the annual gift-tax exclusion of $14,000, says Jon Ulin, managing principal of Ulin & Co. in Boca Raton, Fla. Each state has its own laws so check with your accountant on how such a gift might affect your state estate taxes.\n\nUnlimited payments can be made directly to a medical provider or educational institution on behalf of others. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nIt is also possible to help pay off someone\u2019s student loan, Mr. Kantrowitz says. If the student is in college, is a dependent and the money is from the student\u2019s parents, there is no impact on the student\u2019s financial aid. If any of these conditions aren\u2019t met, the payment is treated as untaxed income to the student and may reduce aid by as much as half of the gift, he says. However, the tax deduction on student- loan interest is available only to taxpayers who are obligated to repay the debt.\n\nIf the payment exceeds the $14,000 annual gift-tax exclusion (twice that for a married couple giving together), the excess may use up part of the lifetime estate-tax exemption amount of $5.45 million or result in gift taxes owed by the giver, says Mr. Kantrowitz.\n\n4. Make a donation\n\nDonating to a charity or cause in the name of the gift recipient can have a double, and lasting, impact.\n\nFor example, if the person has a favorite college sports team, it may be possible to make a donation in his or her name to a scholarship fund for the players, says Jennifer Harper, director of Bridge Financial Planning LLC in Chattanooga, Tenn.\n\nFor children, Ms. Harper suggests making a donation in their name combined with a physical gift that they can relate to. If they enjoy the local zoo and have, say, a favorite bear or tiger there, give them a stuffed bear or tiger and a record of the financial gift to the zoo in their name.\n\nDonor-advised funds offer options for charitable-minded gift-givers as well. Fidelity Charitable, Schwab Charitable and Vanguard Charitable all offer donor-advised funds, which hold and manage funds designated for future disbursement to charitable organizations. Gift givers can make contributions to their own fund in honor of someone else, or donate to the gift recipient\u2019s fund.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible to set up and contribute to a donor-advised fund in another person\u2019s name. Check with the fund companies, as there may be restrictions for third parties. The minimum initial contribution is $5,000 at Fidelity and Schwab, and $25,000 at Vanguard.\n\nGifts to donor-advised funds are irrevocable, and the money in those funds grows tax-free. Donations count toward tax deductions only in the year the money is put in the fund, not when distributions are made, possibly in subsequent years.\n\nGiving to a donor-advised fund may be an especially smart move this year given the possibility of a tax overhaul under the Trump administration. Many financial advisers are telling clients tax benefits for charitable donations could be reduced next year.\n\nMs. Dagher is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York and host of the \u201cWatching Your Wealth\u201d podcast.

Illustration: Yarek Waszul for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe benefits of a double major in college seem obvious. By gaining expertise in two different areas, many believe, students will have a significant edge when it comes to launching and advancing a career.\n\nThat may be especially true, the thinking goes, if a student can combine a higher-paying degree in science, technology, engineering or math (STEM) with the creative and cultural benefits that come from a liberal-arts education.\n\nBut a recent paper published in the Journal of Benefit-Cost Analysis casts doubt on that thinking.\n\nPart of the problem, the study\u2019s authors say, is that while double-majoring is fairly common (at about 20%, according to the 2010 National Survey of College Graduates) most double majors are in related areas that provide limited educational diversity. What\u2019s more, even combining a liberal-arts major with a STEM or business degree typically doesn\u2019t increase earnings or job satisfaction, they found.\n\nJournal Report Podcast Subscribe to the Journal Report podcast at wsj.com, on iTunes or Google Play Music.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal spoke with the paper\u2019s authors, Joni Hersch, a professor of law and economics at Vanderbilt University\u2019s Law School, and Alison Del Rossi, associate dean of faculty affairs and associate professor of economics at St. Lawrence University in Canton, N.Y., about their research. Edited excerpts follow.\n\nInsignificant advantage\n\nWSJ: Why did you decide to study double-majoring?\n\nDR. HERSCH: We noticed that many students think they need more than one major to be competitive in the labor market and they\u2019re scattered across many different fields trying to get credentials. That led to the question: Is there really is any merit to spreading yourself so thin?\n\nWSJ: What did you find?\n\nDR. HERSCH: We found some evidence that certain combinations of double majors confer advantages over a single major, but they weren\u2019t overwhelming. For example, there is some support to the notion that being able to look at problems from different perspectives enhances creativity, as advocates of liberal arts suggest. But students who combine liberal arts with a business or STEM major don\u2019t earn more money than if they majored in business or STEM alone.\n\nWSJ: Are there other incentives to double major?\n\nDR. HERSCH: Double-majoring didn\u2019t affect job satisfaction. Job match\u2014reflecting the extent students use their education on the job\u2014mostly had no association or a negative association with double-majoring.\n\nDR. DEL ROSSI: For instance, students majoring in STEM alone had a higher job match then students majoring in both STEM and liberal arts. It makes sense; if students major in math and theater they are unlikely to find a job that uses all of those skills.\n\nWSJ: What combination earned the most money?\n\nDR. DEL ROSSI: Generally the highest paying majors are within STEM fields or include STEM as one of the majors. But the combination of liberal arts and STEM fields don\u2019t have higher estimated returns than for single STEM or double-STEM majors.\n\nWSJ: Were there gender differences when it came to earnings?\n\nDR. DEL ROSSI: For men the most lucrative combination is business and STEM, but for women there seems to be no additional advantage of adding a business major to a STEM degree. The finding may reflect the fact that more men major in STEM and the added business degree creates a mark of distinction. Whereas so few women major in STEM [by comparison] that their major already distinguishes them.\n\nToo rigid\n\nWSJ: How do these findings fit with an earlier paper you wrote on the subject?\n\nDR. HERSCH: In the first paper, we found that double majors added about 2% to earnings. That was using data from 2003. The discrepancy between the two papers may have to do with the Great Recession when wages were stagnant. The second paper used data from 2010. We wondered whether the versatility and skills associated with a double major protect against recessionary pressure. I don\u2019t think they did.\n\nStudents who double major don\u2019t take longer to graduate, so the costs associated with double-majoring are low, the researchers say. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nWSJ: Do you think it makes sense to double major?\n\nDR. HERSCH: Students who double major don\u2019t take longer to graduate, so the costs associated with double-majoring are low, but as our research shows there isn\u2019t a huge payoff either.\n\nI personally think double-majoring becomes too rigid. There are requirements for both majors, limiting the number of elective courses such as political science, art and philosophy, that students can take. Most double majors are within a single discipline, like two business majors or two STEM majors. So, that\u2019s where there is a loss.\n\nDR. DEL ROSSI: We call it credentialization. Students have two majors, three minors and work to earn a bunch of certificates, but all that interferes with the ability to explore different topics that interest them.\n\nMs. Ward is a writer in Mendham, N.J.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mistakes-we-make-when-giving-to-charity-1481512441", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Although most people are by nature very generous, they don\u2019t think clearly when it comes to donating to charity. Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Christopher Olivola and Lunch Break\u2019s Tanya Rivero discuss the three biggest mistakes people make when considering a charitable donation. Photo: Getty Images\n\nAll of us think about giving during the holiday season. But it\u2019s possible that we\u2019re thinking about it wrong.\n\nThat\u2019s the conclusion of recent research, which suggests that our generosity and good intentions are hamstrung by tricks our minds play on us. Most people by their nature are very generous, but they don\u2019t think clearly about the choices they make when they donate to charity.\n\nFor example, they may donate less than they otherwise would, because they assume that giving will make them less happy than receiving. The fact is that studies show the opposite: When we\u2019re generous and spend on others, we feel happier and more fulfilled.\n\nIn addition, many people assume that donating time to a good cause is much more valuable than just giving money, because writing a check seems too easy to be really meaningful. In fact, though, gifts of money often do more good than a single volunteer\u2019s efforts could.\n\nTo demonstrate the power of these mistakes, we surveyed a sample of The Wall Street Journal\u2019s followers on social media. Our survey was modeled after scientific studies conducted on thousands of subjects. While we found that these respondents were quite generous overall\u2014over 96% said they had given to a charity within the past year\u2014we also identified many of these same errors involving the consideration of pro-social trade-offs.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at three of the main errors that limit the scope and effectiveness of our generosity.\n\nMistake 1: The martyrdom effect\n\nOne of the biggest errors people make involves a phenomenon that one of us, Dr. Olivola, calls the \u201cmartyrdom effect\u201d\u2014the tendency to prefer forms of giving that involve significant sacrifice and effort, such as running marathons or taking the ice-bucket challenge.\n\nThis means that when we assess the trade-offs of various forms of giving, we are biased to admire the more-challenging ways of helping (e.g., volunteering in a poor country), even when easier means (e.g., donating money) are far more effective. Instead of donating money to a medical institute, we decide it\u2019s better to participate in an endurance-cycling fundraiser.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario involving two physicians, William and Theodore. After completing his residency, William opened up a private practice in Los Angeles and earns an annual salary of $700,000. He lives a very comfortable life. Every year he donates $50,000 to Doctors Without Borders, which helps treat people in poor countries. His donations save 500 lives a year and help treat hundreds more.\n\nAfter completing his residency, Theodore joined Doctors Without Borders and earns an annual salary of $23,000. He moves regularly, living in the rural villages of various Third World countries. He works directly with sick and injured people in these poor countries, providing them with medical treatment and advice. Through his work, he saves 200 lives every year and treats hundreds more.\n\nWhich of these physicians is leading a more admirable life? And who is doing more to improve the welfare of other human beings?\n\nFrom a utilitarian perspective, it\u2019s clear that William is doing far more to improve the welfare of others, as his monetary donations save more than twice as many lives. However, several studies have found that most people take a different view. For example, 92% of The Wall Street Journal social-media followers we surveyed indicated that Theodore, the doctor at Doctors Without Borders, was leading a more-admirable life. And 60% said that he was doing more to improve the welfare of others, even though he saved fewer lives than William.\n\nTo better understand this apparent contradiction, we asked these respondents if they believed that people should use their skills \u201cprimarily to help others in need\u201d or \u201cprimarily to pursue their own personal goals.\u201d Those with a more selfless approach to life were much more likely to believe that Theodore was a model of generosity. Having a more selfish orientation led people to prefer the approach that ended up saving more lives.\n\nRespondents who read other vignettes voiced similar opinions. For example, 81% thought that an investment banker who helps feed 100 people a week by volunteering at a soup kitchen leads a more-admirable life than one who helps feed twice as many by donating money to the soup kitchen. Dr. Olivola and his colleagues\u2014Bennett Foddy at New York University and Ashley Whillans at the University of British Columbia\u2014found the same patterns of responses when they surveyed medical professionals and high-net-worth individuals.\n\nThis is not to diminish the value of volunteering. In some cases, the best way to give is to sacrifice blood, sweat and tears for a good cause. And some people lack the means to donate money, so it\u2019s better for them to give time and effort. But it\u2019s important to analyze our options to see which choice helps the most people, and make sure that we aren\u2019t being misled by the martyrdom effect. Sometimes, the most-effective way to give is also the easiest.\n\nMistake 2: The Other-Nothing Neglect\n\nIn another research project, Dr. Olivola asks people to consider trade-offs between selfish and generous outcomes. A typical choice: They can choose to receive $15 for themselves or to have Unicef receive $35.\n\nAlthough it may seem like a simple trade-off, people tend not to think through such choices carefully. We are cognitively lazy creatures, with limited mental bandwidth, which means that we can\u2019t contemplate the opportunity cost of every alternative. In fact, Dr. Olivola has found that our attention to these opportunity costs is asymmetric: We are quick to consider what we stand to lose by being generous but slow to consider what others stand to lose if we choose to be selfish. In the above example, we recognize and weigh the consequences of giving up $15 (the cost of a very nice sandwich) but fail to fully contemplate the implications of Unicef not receiving $35 (the cost of vaccinating several children).\n\nFortunately, Dr. Olivola\u2019s experiments have shown that people can be nudged to think through these kinds of choices in a more-balanced way, by subtly amending the description. Instead of telling people that they would get $15, he now also reminds them that if they choose that option, \u201cUnicef gets nothing.\u201d\n\nOn the face of it, this reminder seems to be unnecessary\u2014clearly, if I choose to keep the $15, then it means that Unicef will not receive the $35. Yet these three extra words make a big difference. In our online survey, adding the reminder that Unicef would get nothing if they chose to receive $15 reduced the percentage of people who selected this selfish option by more than a third. By contrast, reminding them that if they give to Unicef then they get nothing did not impact their choices. Dr. Olivola and his graduate student, John Han, have also found this pattern with much larger samples of respondents\u2014a phenomenon Dr. Olivola calls the \u201cother-nothing effect.\u201d\n\nThe robustness of the other-nothing effect suggests that it can be used to boost our generosity. For example, instead of asking potential donors whether or not they would be willing to donate a particular suggested amount, charities could frame the question as a choice between donating that amount versus \u201cchoosing\u201d to have the charity receive nothing (or $0). By helping us see around a blind spot, making us more aware of what happens to others when we keep everything for ourselves, we can think more effectively about these trade-offs.\n\nMistake 3: The unexpected joy of giving\n\nMost people assume that generosity involves sacrifice: We are giving something up so someone else can have more. Charity might get us to heaven, but it probably won\u2019t make us happy, at least here on earth. But this assumption turns out to be largely incorrect. In fact, many people experience a bigger boost in happiness when they spend money on other people. In these cases, giving is literally better than getting.\n\nConsider research from Elizabeth Dunn of the University of British Columbia, Lara Aknin at Simon Fraser University and Michael Norton at Harvard Business School. They handed out envelopes containing $5 or $20 to people on the street. For some, the cash came with a note asking them to spend the money on themselves. Among other things, these people bought jewelry, drinks at Starbucks and sushi. The other half of the subjects got a note asking them to spend the money on someone else or donate it to charity. They reported giving money to the needy and buying gifts for others. Instead of getting coffee for themselves, they treated a friend to a cup.\n\nAt the end of the day, the researchers called everyone up and asked them how the unexpected windfall had impacted their happiness that day. The first surprising finding was that the amount of money ($5 or $20) didn\u2019t matter much. What was even more surprising was that those who had been assigned to spend that money on others reported higher levels of happiness.\n\nIllustration: Brian Stauffer for The Wall Street Journal\n\nWe found a similar effect in our own survey. When we asked our online respondents to imagine how happy they would be if they spent a $100 windfall on themselves, their average response on a five-point scale (with 5 being \u201cvery happy\u201d) was 3.89. However, when we asked a second group how happy they would be if they spent that $100 on someone else, they reported an average happiness level of 4.32.\n\nWe often assume giving money away is a choice between our happiness and the happiness of others. But this research is a reminder that generosity is much better than that: We are built so that giving also feels good. When we donate to a cause we believe in, everybody wins.\n\nTaken together, these three mental mistakes suggest that many people probably aren\u2019t being generous enough with their money. This is true for both selfless and selfish reasons: We should donate more to our favorite charities if we want to improve the world, but also if we want to improve our own mood.\n\nDr. Benartzi, a frequent contributor to the Journal Reports, is a professor and co-head of the behavioral decision-making group at UCLA Anderson School of Management and author of \u201cThe Smarter Screen\u201d about online behavior.

But even if you aren\u2019t, you might benefit from doing so.\n\nThere are several possible scenarios here. First, if you begin collecting Social Security benefits before you reach 65, the Social Security Administration (which handles Medicare applications) will automatically enroll you in Medicare Part A (and Part B) when you hit that age. Most people, if they have paid Medicare taxes while working, don\u2019t have to pay a monthly premium for Part A, which covers hospital expenses.\n\nSecond, if you aren\u2019t collecting Social Security and you retire before turning 65, and if you have retiree health insurance through your former employer, you will need to enroll in Medicare at 65. Your retiree plan will become a \u201csecondary payer\u201d and Medicare will become your primary insurance.\n\nPREVIOUSLY IN ASK ENCORE\n\nThird, if you aren\u2019t collecting Social Security at 65 and you\u2019re still employed and have a group health plan, your employer might require that you sign up for Medicare.\n\nFourth: You\u2019re 65, no Social Security benefits, still working, have a group health plan, and your employer doesn\u2019t require that you enroll in Medicare. In this case, there\u2019s no outside mandate to sign up for Part A. But there\u2019s a good reason to do so. If you need hospital care, your work insurance might not cover all expenses. In which case, you could turn to Part A, which would act as a secondary payer.\n\nAll that said, there is a caveat, notes Philip Moeller, author of \u201cGet What\u2019s Yours for Medicare.\u201d A person enrolled in Medicare can\u2019t contribute to a health savings account, a tax-advantaged vehicle that can be used to pay for health-care expenses. If you have an HSA, and wish to keep funding it, you\u2019ll need to decide: sign up for Part A, or stick with your HSA.\n\nMr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal and co-author of \u201cThe Wall Street Journal Complete Retirement Guidebook.\u201d You can email questions and comments to askencore@wsj.com.", "date": null, "title": "Great Movies to Watch About Retirement"}

Illustration: Steve Dininno for The Wall Street Journal\n\nA new rule that proponents say will protect retirement savers from conflicted advice and inflated fees is looking more likely to be delayed or repealed in the coming months in the wake of Donald Trump \u2019s victory in the presidential election.\n\nThat has left many investors wondering what is and isn\u2019t allowed when it comes to the management of the $3 trillion in retirement assets held in accounts that charge investors commissions.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of where things stand and what investors need to know.\n\nWhat\u2019s the rule, and why is it suddenly up in the air?\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s so-called fiduciary rule, set to take effect April 10, 2017, requires brokers and others who give retirement advice to act in clients\u2019 best interests. Previous rules required that brokers\u2019 advice merely had to be \u201csuitable\u201d for a retirement investor.\n\nThe rule has been contentious since before its passage in the spring. The Obama administration says conflicted advice costs American families $17 billion a year and pushes down annual returns on their retirement savings by a percentage point. Financial-industry leaders say those figures are too large and have fought the regulation.\n\nNow, with Mr. Trump headed to the White House and Republicans retaining control of both houses of Congress, opponents of the rule have set their sights on repealing or replacing it. They say the rule, which favors fee-based advice over commissions, will hurt retirement savers by limiting their access to advice and leading to heftier fees for savers with smaller accounts who make fewer trades.\n\nIf the rule is repealed, what impact will that have on my retirement savings?\n\nThat depends on who is managing your money. If you have a financial planner or an adviser who is a registered investment adviser, you are already getting fiduciary-level care because they already are required to adhere to that standard.\n\nIf you have retirement accounts with brokerages or insurers, however, you may be receiving investment advice that has to meet only the suitability standard.\n\nKilling the rule would allow brokers and annuity sellers to continue to charge commissions without having to comply with heightened disclosure requirements on the advice and products being sold. The rule\u2019s repeal could leave open the door to the types of conflicts that fiduciary-rule supporters say are inherent in commission-based accounts, where advisers might push costlier products.\n\nIf the rule is repealed, can I get fiduciary care without changing to a fee-based adviser?\n\nBrokerage firms have unveiled different approaches to complying with the fiduciary rule, which includes an exemption allowing brokers in some cases to continue offering commission-based retirement products, as long as they are acting in the best interests of clients.\n\nMerrill Lynch said it would ditch commission-based retirement products altogether, but other firms said they planned to use the exemption and continue offering commission-based products to retirement investors to varying extents.\n\nMorgan Stanley, for instance, said it planned to continue offering commission-based IRAs through which clients would be able to invest in many of the types of products they do now, including stocks, bonds and a range of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.\n\nEdward Jones and independent broker-dealer LPL Financial Holdings Inc. also planned to continue offering commission-based options to retirement savers, but with restrictions. Edward Jones, for example, said investors wouldn\u2019t be able to use commission-based IRAs to invest in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. LPL was planning to introduce a mutual-fund-only IRA that charges a commission in early 2017 with a menu of funds it chooses.\n\nCould the fiduciary rule survive in watered-down form?\n\nSome say proponents\u2019 best hope for the rule to survive may be in some sort of compromise.\n\n\u201cI could see a much-pared-down rule that at least limits the size of commissions,\u201d says Rep. Brad Sherman (D., Calif.), a member of the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nOthers think it is more likely that the rule\u2019s compliance deadline will be delayed, as opposed to the rule being materially altered or killed.\n\n\u201cTo repeal would be a bit of a stretch,\u201d says Michael Spellacy, head of global wealth management at PwC LLP, adding that the Trump administration may seek to extend compliance deadlines to give \u201ctimeline relief\u201d to the industry.\n\nWill some advisers still stick to a fiduciary standard, even if they aren\u2019t legally bound to one?\n\nSome experts say that because the financial industry has been preparing for the fiduciary rule for months, it may live on in spirit, if not in law.\n\nMany brokerage firms have invested substantial sums to adjust their business models and update internal controls to be compliant with the rule by April, and some have spent money advertising their commitment to fiduciary responsibility.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t undo that sort of thing,\u201d says Denise Valentine, senior analyst at consulting firm Aite Group LLC. Moreover, some advisers prefer a fee-based model for the more predictable revenue it offers.\n\nHow do you know if your adviser is held to a fiduciary standard?\n\nAdvisers who are registered investment advisers, or RIAs, are already held to a fiduciary standard. Some broker-dealers, currently required to recommend investments that are \u201csuitable\u201d as opposed to those that are in a client\u2019s best interest, also already serve as fiduciaries and use a fee-based model.\n\nThe best way to know if your adviser adheres to a fiduciary standard?

Illustration: Jon Krause for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe allure of tax-free growth has made the Roth individual retirement account an increasingly popular investment vehicle to leave to children or other loved ones. But heirs won\u2019t reap the full benefit of a Roth if it isn\u2019t passed down correctly.\n\nRoth IRAs are different from traditional IRAs in that contributions are made after taxes instead of before. Withdrawals from a Roth in existence for five years or more after age 59\u00bd are income-tax-free, and beneficiaries of an inherited Roth also don\u2019t have to pay income taxes on withdrawals and additional growth in the account.\n\n\u201cFrom a legacy giving standpoint, it\u2019s one of the more beneficial gifts that a person can pass on to the next generation,\u201d says Scott Sparks, a wealth-management adviser with Northwestern Mutual based in Denver.\n\nBy the end of 2015, Roth IRAs had accumulated an estimated $660 billion in assets, up from $354.9 billion five years earlier, according to fund-industry trade group Investment Company Institute. But as they gain in popularity and more people are set to inherit them, experts say it\u2019s critical to avoid common mistakes that can knock the wind out of a Roth\u2019s sails.\n\nHere are four common mistakes made when planning to pass along a Roth\u2014and how to avoid them.\n\n1. Not naming a beneficiary\n\nIt might seem obvious, but when planning to leave a Roth IRA to heirs, it is critical that the account holder actually name the beneficiaries.\n\nThat means account holders generally have to fill out forms in addition to their will, spelling out who\u2014or what trust\u2014is going to get the Roth when the account holder dies.\n\nIt is important to make sure the account is titled correctly. If a beneficiary is someone other than a spouse, for example, it must be made clear that the heir owns the Roth and that it was inherited from the original owner.\n\n\u201cYou have to preserve the title,\u201d says Diana Zeydel, global chairman of the trusts and estates department at law firm Greenberg Traurig LLP in Miami. Otherwise, your heirs may not be permitted to stretch out required distributions across their life expectancy, which is what gives the remaining assets more time to grow tax-free.\n\n\u201cBy far the biggest benefits of the Roth IRA after death are tax-free growth in the account and the fact that distributions can be made without income-tax consequences,\u201d says Bobbi Bierhals, a partner at law firm McDermott Will & Emery in Chicago.\n\n2. Choosing the wrong beneficiary\n\nWhile it\u2019s common for Roth owners to choose their spouse as a beneficiary, experts say careful thought should be given as to any additional beneficiaries. (Once the spouse dies, for instance, the Roth can be passed along one more time to another beneficiary or group of beneficiaries.)\n\nChoosing a grandchild or great-grandchild, to be the additional beneficiary can maximize the amount of time Roth assets have to grow income-tax-free.\n\nHere\u2019s why: Roth beneficiaries who aren\u2019t spouses generally must begin taking annual required minimum distributions by Dec. 31 of the year following the year in which the account holder dies. However, they can use a formula set by the IRS to stretch these withdrawals over their life expectancy. The younger a beneficiary is, the longer his or her life expectancy is and the smaller the required minimum distribution is going to be.\n\n\u201cYou can potentially stretch that income tax-free growth for 50, 60 or even 70 years,\u201d says Ms. Bierhals.\n\nKeep in mind that leaving a Roth to a grandchild or great-grandchild could trigger estate and generation-skipping transfer tax for some, experts say.\n\n3. Forgetting to take required minimum distributions\n\nUnlike with traditional IRAs, owners of Roth IRAs don\u2019t have to take required minimum distributions, or RMDs, while they are living.\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nWhen spouses inherit Roths, they can roll the account into their own names and continue to defer RMDs, says Cathy Schnaubelt, a senior wealth strategist at Atlantic Trust in Houston. But a non-spouse heir or anyone who inherits the Roth from the spouse generally has to start taking annual distributions.\n\nHeirs must be proactive about this, she says. Failing to take distributions as required by the IRS can result in the money having to be withdrawn in five years, depriving the beneficiary of a lifetime of tax-free growth.\n\n\u201cBrokerage houses don\u2019t always remind you of them,\u201d warns Boston-based CPA Scott Kaplowitch, so it\u2019s up to the heir to stay on top of RMDs.\n\n4. Making mistakes with a trust\n\nIn some cases, especially if the beneficiaries are young, it might make sense to use a trust to pass along a Roth IRA to the next generation. But experts warn that this can open up a minefield of mistakes.\n\n\u201cWithin the trust you have to have specific named beneficiaries [for the Roth], and it generally has to be what\u2019s called a conduit trust,\u201d says Ms. Schnaubelt. \u201cThat trust, then, has to make out the required minimum distributions every year.\u201d\n\nMost situations will require very particular terms in the trust, says Ms. Bierhals, adding that \u201cif you do it wrong, the IRS can cause you to distribute the entire IRA within five years.\u201d\n\nAnna Prior is a writer in Michigan.

Illustration: Dan Page for The Wall Street Journal\n\nAre you keeping a close eye on your 401(k) and other retirement plans? You should, because employers and plan managers make mistakes\u2014and that can lead to big headaches and out-of-pocket costs for you.\n\nJust ask Benjamin Levy, a retired information-technology professional whose former employer erroneously deposited in his 401(k) a portion of a bonus that he received after he retired. The company overlooked its own plan\u2019s rules prohibiting retirees from making contributions. Meanwhile, Mr. Levy already had rolled that contribution into an IRA, along with most of his 401(k) balance.\n\nNow Mr. Levy may be on the hook for taxes and penalties for the portion of his IRA rollover that should have been paid as income to him.\n\nMistakes by retirement-plan sponsors are a frustration for many retirees.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a broad range of mistakes involving both defined-contribution and defined-benefit plans,\u201d says Emily Spreiser, legal program director at the Pension Rights Center, a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington, D.C. Such mistakes include: failing to put contributions into 401(k) accounts in a timely manner; contributing too much or too little; failing to abide by the participant investment elections; failing to enroll new workers when they become eligible; failing to automatically increase workers\u2019 contribution rates when the plan rules call for it.\n\nThe list goes on.\n\nThreatening letters\n\nAmong the most difficult cases are those where the employer overpaid benefits for many years and then attempts to recoup the money. Such recoupment efforts occur mostly with traditional pension plans, in part because there\u2019s a monthly check the company can reduce. Also, employers are responsible for making sure the entire group of current and future beneficiaries isn\u2019t harmed by any lost benefits.\n\nIn one case, a retired janitor was collecting about $15,000 a year in benefits until the pension-plan sponsor realized it had his date of birth wrong, says Bill Bortz, a retired lawyer who worked on pension plans at the U.S. Treasury Department and now works with the Pension Rights Center on a pro-bono basis.\n\nDue to a clerical error, the company thought the pensioner was 10 years older than he was, Mr. Bortz says. The company told the retiree that his benefit would be reduced and past overpayments would be recouped. The result? His pension checks dropped to zero, Mr. Bortz says, until lawyers from the Pension Rights Center stepped in and negotiated with the employer to reduce the recoupment.\n\nIn contrast, when an overpayment occurs with a 401(k) plan, the plan sponsor \u201cis not in a position to reduce future benefits,\u201d Ms. Spreiser says. \u201cTheir only method for reclaiming that money is writing to the participant saying, \u2018You owe us this money. Please pay it back,\u2019 \u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIn some of these letters, we have seen threats to sue or language insinuating there is a potential for future litigation if the participant fails to comply,\u201d she says. \u201cBut a lot of times plans don\u2019t end up suing.\u201d\n\nEmployer fixes\n\nIn many instances, the quicker a retirement-plan mistake is caught, the less pain there is for the plan participant. Say an employer realizes it has failed to implement a worker\u2019s election to increase her contribution rate. In general, to resolve the situation the company must make an additional payment in salary to the worker equal to 25% of what should have been withheld from the worker\u2019s pay, adjusted for earnings. The employee gets the benefit of that extra contribution, though her retirement account still has less in it than she had intended. But she can increase her contributions going forward.\n\nThe specifics of each situation determine what the appropriate remedy is under IRS and Labor Department rules. For example, in the situation described above, if the employer finds and fixes the mistake in less than three months, it doesn\u2019t owe the worker that extra payment.\n\nTwo common errors are calculating 401(k) contributions based on incorrect compensation\u2014such as a bonus if the plan\u2019s rules exclude bonuses\u2014and failing to get contributions into the plan in a timely manner, says Jason M. Lumpkin, a senior manager in the pension and benefits group of Schneider Downs & Co., in Pittsburgh.\n\nAnother common problem \u201cis issues with auto-enrollment and auto-escalation,\u201d says Marcia Wagner, founder of Wagner Law Group, based in Boston, which works with employers to fix plan mistakes. \u201cThe plan says you\u2019re auto-enrolled at, say, 3% and after one year it goes up to 5%. Employers are supposed to do that and they don\u2019t for whatever reason. It\u2019s an administrative snafu. It happens a lot,\u201d Ms. Wagner says.\n\nThings to look for\n\nHere\u2019s what individuals can do to monitor their retirement plans themselves, and to make sure that if a mistake is made, it gets corrected quickly:\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nCheck your paystubs: Make sure your account balance matches up with your contributions. Mr. Lumpkin says: \u201cReview your paystubs as much as possible and review your quarterly account statements. Take the time because mistakes do happen and the sooner you catch it the sooner you can get it corrected.\u201d\n\nConfirm changes: If you\u2019ve made any changes to your plan, such as changed your contribution rate, taken out a loan or changed your investment elections, \u201cfollow up to make sure it\u2019s what you wanted to occur,\u201d says Sherri Painter, a senior vice president and director at PNC, a financial-services firm that offers retirement-plan services to employers.\n\nSave your plan documents: If you receive a letter from your plan sponsor reporting a mistake, \u201cread everything as carefully as possible,\u201d says Ms. Spreiser of the Pension Rights Center. \u201cDig out any documents\u201d you have, she says, including any records on payments received.\n\nFollow the plan protocol: If you think there has been a mistake, try to confirm it in the rules in your summary plan description. Then contact your company\u2019s human-resources department. \u201cMake a claim under whatever the protocol is according to the plan,\u201d Ms. Wagner says.\n\nGet free expert help: For free help in contesting pension mistakes, go to PensionHelp.org, a service of the Pension Rights Center, or call its hotline at 888-420-6550. If you\u2019re curious how your pension benefits were calculated, free help is available from the American Academy of Actuaries\u2019 Pension Assistance List. The U.S. Labor Department has details about the rights of retirement-plan participants. The Labor Department pamphlet \u201cWhat You Should Know About Your Retirement Plan\u201d also is excellent.\n\nMr. Levy, the retired IT worker whose employer mishandled his 401(k), says he plans to ask the company to reimburse his out-of-pocket costs for dealing with his issue, including the cost of revising his 2014 tax return. It\u2019s unclear at this point how the employer will respond.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have less money in my IRA and more money in my after-tax assets than I otherwise would have,\u201d Mr. Levy says.

Illustration: Richard Mia for The Wall Street Journal\n\nOne of the most important financial decisions people make is when to retire. It\u2019s also one of the worst decisions many people make.\n\nSpecifically, they retire too early, resulting in serious financial shortfalls in old age.\n\nThe good news is that, according to a new study by Philipp Schreiber and Martin Weber at the University of Mannheim in Germany, there\u2019s a simple two-question quiz that can help predict whether you\u2019ll regret the timing of your own retirement. Here are the questions:\n\nQuestion 1: You just learned that you are due a tax refund. If you\u2019d like, you can get the $1,000 refund right away. Alternatively, you can get a $1,100 refund in 10 months. Which do you prefer?\n\nQuestion 2: You just learned that you are due a tax refund. If you\u2019d like, you can get a $1,000 refund in 18 months. Alternatively, you can get a $1,100 refund in 28 months? Which do you prefer?\n\nThe two questions are nearly identical. Each poses the same kind of choice. But the second question postpones the two options for delivery by 18 months, while the first offers an option for immediate delivery.\n\nTime will tell\n\nThe point of the exercise is to measure the consistency of a person\u2019s time preferences. Someone with consistent time preferences should answer both questions the same way\u2014choosing the early option both times, or the delayed option both times. Such consistency is a requirement for making financial plans that you stick with.\n\nSome people, however, choose inconsistently. They will take the larger tax refund if both refunds require a delay, as in the second question. But they choose to accept the smaller amount when it is available immediately, as it is in the first question. For these people, the prospect of getting an immediate reward is simply too difficult to resist.\n\nThe respondents with inconsistent answers exhibit a tendency known as present bias, or hyperbolic discounting. They strongly prefer rewards that arrive right away.\n\nWhile previous research has linked present bias to a lack of retirement savings, this new study, which tallied results from more than 3,000 Germans, shows that present bias can also lead people to retire before they are financially ready.\n\nThe researchers found that people who give the most inconsistent answers tend to retire significantly earlier (about 2.2 years on average) than those with consistent preferences. This leads to a roughly 13% reduction in their monthly benefits. Over time, these people are also far more likely to say they regretted the timing of their retirement.\n\nHelp steering\n\nThis research helps us better understand why people choose to retire early. It can also help us find ways to stop people from retiring too early.\n\nFor instance, many workers now benefit from automatic savings programs that rely on default payroll deductions to help them save for retirement. These programs generally use a one-size-fits-all approach, recommending the same savings rate for all workers.\n\nWhile these defaults have boosted savings for many Americans, they could be even more effective if they were personalized according to the results of the two-question quiz. Consider a person who exhibits a strong bias for receiving rewards in the present. Given the likelihood that she\u2019ll be tempted by an early retirement, she might want to be defaulted to a higher savings rate during her working years. This will help her avoid future regret over the timing of her retirement decision, since she will have sufficient savings.\n\nWe can also redesign the Social Security enrollment process to minimize the possibility of regret. The program is structured so that you can start receiving payments at any time after the age of 62. However, the monthly payments will be larger for every month you delay signing up to receive benefits, at least until you turn 70. For instance, a person who can expect to receive $1,000 per month if they retire at 62 will see his benefits increase to approximately $1,750 per month if he can wait until he\u2019s 70 before collecting.\n\nA number of economists have argued that waiting for the larger payment is usually a much better deal. Nevertheless, most people aren\u2019t willing to wait. According to an analysis by Alicia Munnell and Anqi Chen at Boston College, the most popular age, by far, to start Social Security is 62.\n\nFewer regrets\n\nWith the new research from Germany, we can come up with strategies to encourage better decisions. One approach is to ask people to estimate their preferred retirement age when they are still working. Because retirement benefits are far off, they probably won\u2019t be tempted by the smaller/sooner amount and will likely predict an age well past 62. While this estimated age isn\u2019t binding, it will allow Social Security to personalize communication with that person in a way that might reduce their future regret. (The monetary amount itself won\u2019t change, just the way the options are presented.)\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nLet\u2019s say, for instance, that a person stated a preferred retirement age of 70 during his working years. When presenting his retirement options, Social Security could describe the benefits he\u2019d collect at 62 as a relative loss of approximately $750 per month, at least compared with the benefits he\u2019d receive if he waited until his preferred retirement age. Such framing could make the possibility of starting benefits right away far less appealing.\n\nNobody wants to regret his or her retirement choices; many of these decisions cannot be undone. By identifying those workers who are planning for a late retirement but are likely to succumb to the temptation of an early one, we can take steps to prevent mistakes before they occur.\n\nDr. Benartzi, a frequent contributor to the Journal Reports, is a professor and co-head of the behavioral decision-making group at UCLA Anderson School of Management, and author of \u201cThe Smarter Screen,\u201d about online behavior.

WSJ's Charlie Wells and Lunch Break's Tanya Rivero discuss what missteps people make regarding their finances and tips on how they can make improvements. Photo Illustration: John Kuczala for The Wall Street Journal\n\nOur relationship to money changes as we get older. So do the mistakes that we make with it.\n\nEvery new stage of life brings new financial strategies we need to follow. And at every stage we find new ways not to follow those strategies, costing ourselves money and jeopardizing our security.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, economic and demographic changes ensure that those mistakes aren\u2019t static, so that the mistakes of the current generations aren\u2019t the same missteps that their predecessors struggled to avoid.\n\nFor instance, when we\u2019re first starting out in our careers, we need to be aggressive with our investing so we can build a nest egg that grows over decades. But research shows today\u2019s 20-somethings hold back on investing or make very conservative moves, because they\u2019re uncomfortable with big risks.\n\nMeanwhile, these days more people are waiting until their 30s to take big plunges like marriage and children. That means a lot of complex financial questions piling up all at once, and many opportunities to mess up. In their 40s, people often fail to pay down a mortgage quickly enough, leaving them covering the costs into retirement. And they don\u2019t pay enough attention to how college expenses\u2014or the cost of providing for children and aging parents at the same time\u2014will affect their finances.\n\nOur fifth decade, unfortunately, often means realizing we\u2019re going to come up short in our retirement savings, sometimes because we\u2019ve lived too large or because we\u2019ve made plans that are too ambitious, such as launching a business. Finally, in our retirement years, we often don\u2019t make an uncomfortable but necessary move\u2014giving family members the power to make big financial decisions for us\u2014even though research shows most of us need that help a lot sooner than we realize.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at some of the biggest mistakes we make, decade by decade\u2014and how to avoid them.\n\n20s: Playing it too safe\n\nThe first full decade of adult life should be about investing heavily, experts say. Yet 20-somethings don\u2019t take enough risks with investments to build up big returns. It\u2019s a conclusion backed up by a number of studies, including a 2016 analysis by Lindsay Larson, an assistant professor of marketing at Georgia Southern University\u2019s College of Business Administration.\n\nHer team sampled a group of roughly 100 millennials and found that they tended to favor retirement accounts with little stock and more guaranteed income\u2014choices that would bring skimpy returns over time. When asked why they chose such a conservative portfolio, participants said things such as, \u201cI honestly know nothing about money right now,\u201d but explained that a portfolio with a lower risk level seemed like the \u201cbest option.\u201d\n\nA majority of the sample \u201cwere selecting retirement portfolios more appropriate for employees nearing their retirement, rather than starting their careers,\u201d Prof. Larson says.\n\nHer study draws on literature that finds that millennials have particularly low financial literacy. Additionally, her study suggests that millennials often struggle with independent thinking, decision making and risk taking because they fear making mistakes. Ms. Larson notes that this lack of risk tolerance is unique to current 20-somethings, and may stem from periods of financial uncertainty during their lifetimes, from 9/11 to the financial crisis.\n\nHer solution isn\u2019t for millennials to take on the riskiest financial investments they can find. Instead, the study suggests that target-date funds, which start out with riskier allocations that gradually become more conservative, are a possible solution.\n\nOther studies show that another kind of crucial investment often gets neglected when people are in their 20s: human capital.\n\nOne 2015 study by Brian Cadena at the University of Colorado Boulder finds that the link between many of these people is impatience. It is not necessarily that people in their 20s are more impatient, but that people in their 20s tend to face the most decisions about investing their time and money in education. He examined data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and identified the behaviors of impatient individuals.\n\nHe found that the impatient are over 50% more likely to drop out of high school despite expressing a desire to finish. The impatient are over 20% more likely to drop out of college with no more than a single year under their belts. Of those who have finished three years of college, the impatient are nearly 70% more likely not to finish their degrees and that means significantly reduced income over their lifetime and reduced investing options.\n\nImpatience can also have negative consequences on future wages, the study suggests. For instance, human capital is also developed on the job, yet impatient people switch jobs often, hampering their chances at developing such capital and salary increases later in life. The study used historical data that didn't include millennials, who tend to switch jobs more often in today\u2019s environment. Although this cohort wasn\u2019t captured, the point of the study was to show that impatient people switch jobs more often than expected, given many controls.\n\nMr. Cadena found impatient people change jobs about 7% more than the patient after completing their education. And while today\u2019s employment paradigm may involve frequent job changes, Mr. Cadena\u2019s study finds that impatient people\u2019s job switches do not bring increases in wages. All things combined, he finds impatient people have earned more than $75,000 less on average than patient people.\n\nHis solution: Early education should emphasize not just hard skills, but also \u201csoft skills\u201d like patience. He also recommends looking at investment in human capital as we might consider getting in shape, for example, by learning to better delay gratification.\n\n30s: Overwhelmed by Complexity\n\nMore so than in previous generations, the third decade of life is when many people start making huge adult commitments such as getting married or having children.\n\nYet many go into that situation with heightened expectations. Manisha Thakor, director of wealth strategies for women at Buckingham & the BAM Alliance, says she comes across many people in this phase of life who want the same standard of living they remember their parents enjoying when they left home.\n\nWhat 30-somethings forget is that it took their parents decades to build up to that stage, she says. Trying to live too large can lead to credit-card debt, and spending instead of saving means missing out on compounding interest. \u201cEarly on, you may live more like a recent graduate student than the overly romanticized images we see in TV and movies,\u201d she says.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, finances overall are more complicated than in the past. Today\u2019s 30-somethings have more options than previous generations in their age bracket. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re prepared to tackle the complexity. And that\u2019s where the mistakes come in.\n\nNick Holeman, a financial adviser for robo-advisory firm Betterment, gives the example of Roth individual retirement accounts. Those in their 20s probably don\u2019t have enough money to seriously consider these accounts, which let people withdraw money tax-free. But as people hit their 30s, and Roth IRAs become more attractive, they need to be aware of the complexity around these accounts. For instance, the annual contribution limit for those under 50 is $5,500. Contributions in excess of this amount may be applied to the next year, but account holders will be charged a 6% penalty for the current year.\n\n40s: Misjudging big expenses\n\nBy our 40s, we tend to be about halfway through our working lives\u2014just as bigger expenses enter the picture. Many financial advisers point to two in particular that can be rife with error: the house and the children.\n\nMany people spend too much on their homes, and a number of people in their 40s don\u2019t work aggressively enough to pay off their mortgages, which can lead to a less-than-optimal income in retirement, says Minneapolis-based financial adviser Jonathan Guyton of Cornerstone Wealth Advisors.\n\n\u201cThe question that comes into play in your later 40s really is: When do we want our mortgage paid off? Let\u2019s say that I\u2019m 47, bought a big house a couple of years ago, but my 30-year mortgage isn\u2019t going to be paid off until I\u2019m 75,\u201d says Mr. Guyton. \u201cThis means during the time in retirement when I\u2019m going to want to spend the most, I\u2019m going to have this albatross around my neck.\u201d\n\nHe recommends that people in their 40s restructure mortgages so that they are repaid earlier, for the sake of their retirement income.\n\nOthers in their 40s find themselves spending too much on their children. The big cost, especially in the later years of the decade, is college. \u201cPeople want to save from the time their children are born, but nobody really knows how bright their kids are going to be, or if they are going to want to go to state university or a small private school. And it usually isn\u2019t until the child is maybe 10 or so that this starts to become clear,\u201d says Mr. Guyton.\n\nHe recommends thinking about the educational decision like buying a car: What will thousands of extra dollars in tuition bring? And parents should consider not only what giving up $200,000 or more could do to retirement plans, but also the opportunity cost of not having the money grow in the market.\n\nEven before these considerations come into play, expenses such as sports or extracurricular activities can get out of hand. Jennifer Lane, a financial planner at Compass Planning Associates in Boston, Mass., recommends that, in general, parents pay no more than 10% of income on expenses for children. She has also found that allowances help keep costs down. \u201cThey\u2019ll choose not to spend when it\u2019s their money versus your money,\u201d she says.\n\nSupporting children carries more complications when people must care for aging parents. Financial advisers say they are seeing clients as young as their 40s struggle with this \u201csandwich\u201d effect, which is different from years past. Because so many people had children later, they must care for them at the same time they have to begin helping older parents. In the past, there was usually more of a gap between when responsibilities toward children ended and care of aging parents began.\n\nScott Cole, founder and president of Cole Financial Planning in Birmingham, Ala., says this is a trend he sees not only with his clients, but in his own life. At 46, he has two children, ages 5 and 7, and with parents in their 70s, he anticipates care-related expenses within the next few years. He notes it is important to plan well in advance to avoid financial surprises.\n\nMs. Lane of Compass Planning says that the age of children on the other end of the \u201csandwich\u201d can vary, now that some parents are waiting longer to have children. She sees clients in this position with children who aren\u2019t even teens, to those around college age.\n\nMs. Lane recommends keeping a \u201cbusiness relationship\u201d with parents when care needs come up. Instead of saying things like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, mom, everything will be all right\u201d and then taking on too much financially, she advises sitting down with financial decision makers and asking questions like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the best way for the family to make this all OK?\u201d\n\nFailing to do so can pass on the financial burden to the next generation, she says.\n\n50s: The difficulty of catching up\n\nOne nightmare scenario for many in their 50s is the realization that they may not have enough money stashed away for retirement. Adults now live much longer lives than they used to, and financial experts say retirement funds now need to last up to 40 years and beyond. Lots of temptations encourage people to withdraw from retirement accounts early, and sometimes unemployment or other squeezes make it difficult to contribute.\n\nThe difficulties can be compounded by lifestyle creep. People in their 50s often develop lifestyles they cannot maintain in retirement and struggle to pay for them in retirement, says Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. \u201cPeople tend to kick up their heels in their 50s when the kids are gone and you\u2019ve paid for college, and up their standards of living,\u201d she says.\n\nA different temptation for those who feel ill prepared for retirement is entrepreneurship. Be it a lifelong dream or perceived necessity, more baby boomers than previous generations are trying to start their own businesses, according to a 2016 paper by Annamaria Lusardi, a professor at George Washington University School of Business. This can bring rewards, such as an easier transition into retirement, she says. But it is often a very dangerous bet.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re putting all of your eggs in your human capital, and often your savings, too,\u201d she says. Sometimes human capital\u2014the skills we have developed throughout our careers\u2014may not be as valuable in the market as we think, she says. And most research shows that as people near retirement, they should take more a conservative approach to their finances.\n\nThose feeling the retirement-account crunch have \u201ca really, really important lever,\u201d says Dr. Munnell: waiting to withdraw from Social Security. Waiting until age 70 instead of age 62 will result in monthly benefits that are 76% higher. \u201cThat\u2019s a really big deal,\u201d she says.\n\n60s and beyond: not delegating\n\nPhoto: iStock Photo\n\nAs we get older, our personal balance sheets grow more complicated. But numerous recent studies on aging reveal an unpleasant truth: Our analytical abilities can\u2019t keep up with the complexity. And since we\u2019re living longer, that makes it even more likely that we\u2019ll have to deal with cognitive impairment.\n\n\u201cWe are living in an aging society across the developed world, and up till now, we didn\u2019t really care about these issues,\u201d says Sumit Agarwal, a professor of finance at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University. Mr. Agarwal\u2019s 2009 study \u201cThe Age of Reason\u201d found that our peak financial decision-making age is 53, based on how people at different age groups made a handful of financial choices.\n\nYet most people overestimate their capabilities, and fail to delegate important tasks as their capacities diminish\u2014potentially leading to mistakes like not reading the fine print on investments. So, Prof. Agarwal suggests that people should delegate financial responsibilities before cognitive degeneration sets in\u2014in the 50s or 60s instead of 70s or 80s.\n\nAnd he suggests the creation of something like a \u201cfinancial driving license\u201d that would require adequate mental capacities to enter the market for some financial products.\n\n\u201cWhy are we allowing them to gamble with their entire life savings?\u201d he asks. \u201cIf we act paternalistic with older adults in many areas of their lives anyway, why aren\u2019t we acting like that with bigger financial decisions?\u201d\n\nMr. Wells is a staff reporter of The Wall Street Journal in London.

Illustration: Anna Parini for The Wall Street Journal\n\nIn the old days, an investor hoping to get in on the ground floor of the next Google or Facebook had a couple of options: have a friend or relative on the inside, or sign on with a big brokerage firm handling the startup company\u2019s private placement\u2014a sale of stock that hasn\u2019t yet gone public.\n\nNot anymore. Ordinary investors now can buy shares in startups that are just getting off the ground, sometimes for just a few dollars. If, that is, they are willing to take on a whole lot of risk.\n\nIt all started with the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act in 2012. Since the act\u2019s Title III took effect in May 2016, people no longer have to be well-to-do \u201caccredited investors\u201d to buy into startups.\n\nTheir stake can be as little as $10, or as much as they like, within Securities and Exchange Commission limits based on income. Investing is done through the soaring number of online \u201cequity crowdfunding portals.\u201d Ones that allow nonaccredited investors include Wefunder, SeedInvest and StartEngine. Well-known portals for accredited investors include EquityNet, Fundable, AngelList and Crowdfunder.\n\nBut along with hopes of 100-fold gains come big downsides. Many of these startups fly beneath the radar of big venture investors who vet fledgling firms. Often, they aren\u2019t promising enough to go public the traditional way, and they lack a track record, proven product and thorough financial disclosures. And since their shares aren\u2019t publicly traded, it may be impossible to cash out until an exit event like an IPO or buyout, and the firm may tank while you wait.\n\n\u201cQuite honestly, it\u2019s as close to gambling as you can get. You are dealing with a level below penny stocks,\u201d says Keith Hamilton, owner of Hamilton & Associates, a registered investment-advisory and wealth-management firm in La Jolla, Calif. When clients want to invest in startups of any kind, he says, \u201cI tell them to call it their gambling account.\u201d\n\nThe crowd gets bigger\n\nThis new method of buying into startups is the latest and hottest development in the broader field of crowdsourcing.\n\nMoney-lending sites like publicly traded LendingClub Corp. make loans from a pool of investor money and pass payments back to investors. Charitable sites like GoFundMe.com allow people to give to causes that may be too small for ordinary foundations, like helping an individual accident victim with living costs. Rewards portals such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo allow donors to contribute to specific projects such as an independent film, and offer perks like a prerelease showing.\n\nEquity crowdfunding\u2014where contributors get actual shares in businesses\u2014began with portals like MicroVentures that largely served accredited investors\u2014people with at least $1 million in net worth excluding the home, or incomes over $200,000. (MicroVentures now serves both accredited and nonaccredited investors.)\n\nThe 2015 Crowdfunding Industry Report by Crowdsourcing LLC\u2019s Massolution.com, the latest industrywide data available, shows $16.2 billion raised through the various types of crowdfunding in 2014, up 167% from the year before. At the end of 2014 there were more than 1,250 crowdfunding portals world-wide, versus 850 in 2012.\n\n\u201cThe floodgates have been opened!\u201d the Massolution report says, and industry experts think growth has continued at a fast clip since that report was written. Many predict more money will be raised in coming years as the number of platforms grows, with new players occupying narrow niches such as fundraising for specific industries and a few big platforms taking an ever-larger share of the market. \u201cInternational expansion will accelerate,\u201d the report predicts.\n\nFor now, the lending, donation and rewards sites dominate crowdfunding. But the equity sector is only likely to grow, as more investors and entrepreneurs learn about it, says John Rampton, an experienced startup investor in Palo Alto, Calif., who has invested in a startups through DreamFunded.\n\n\u201cIn the future, a lot more startups will have a chance of being successful because of the funding they can get without [the help of] the institutional investor,\u201d says Mr. Rampton,\n\nThe Massolution report found that in 2014, before Title III flung open the doors, the average equity campaign in North America aimed to raise $175,000. Portals charge investors a percentage of the funds raised\u2014for example, 5% for DreamFunded, which welcomes investments as small as $10.\n\nA nozzle idea\n\nCurrently, DreamFunded offers investments in startups like Aqua Blaster, a firm with a new hose nozzle for firefighting and pressure washing, and WorkCar, an Uber-like outfit planning to provide work vehicles. The portal supplies bios on startups\u2019 management teams, a quick financial analysis and the firm\u2019s business plan.\n\nDreamFunded\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Manny Fernandez, says the screening also entails interviews with management, credit checks, and criminal and terrorist background checks.\n\nThough he thinks the industry will grow and provide valuable service to startups and small firms ignored by the venture-capital industry, he agrees the investor is more likely to lose money than to get rich.\n\n\u2018If you want a safe, secure bet, this is not the way to go.\u2019 \u2014DreamFunded\u2019s co-founder Manny Fernandez\n\n\u201cI think this is ideal for the person that knows the person that\u2019s raising the money,\u201d such as the owner of a local business, he says.\n\n\u201cI do not see it as a person thinking, \u2018Hmm, I have a choice of putting my money in a CD or funding equity startups.\u2019 If you want a safe, secure bet, this is not the way to go.\u201d\n\nBecause the industry is so new and startup investments often don\u2019t pay off for a decade or more, it\u2019s too early to tell how well investors can do. Generally, the portals highlight their fundraising record, not investor returns.\n\nBut experts say it\u2019s not to soon to see the risks. Marc Seward, principal of Enviso Capital, an investment-advisory firm in San Diego, says he wouldn\u2019t put more than 15% of a client\u2019s portfolio into alternative investments, with startups making up only a fraction of that, regardless of whether the investor uses equity crowdfunding or a more traditional way in.\n\nMr. Seward says he worries that portals\u2019 seal of approval makes a startup look less dangerous than it is.\n\nThough all these sites promote their due diligence, it\u2019s not what you\u2019d get with a listed stock that has met the listing standards of an exchange.\n\n\u201cI see this lack of due diligence as a tremendous weak link in the new crowdfunding equity space,\u201d says Thomas White, co-director of the entrepreneur incubator at American University\u2019s Kogod School of Business.\n\n\u201cI think a major red flag is that the company is looking to crowdfund for equity in the first place,\u201d says John Torrens, professor of entrepreneurial practice at Syracuse University\u2019s Martin J. Whitman School of Management, noting that \u201cthis would signal to me that more-sophisticated angels have looked at it and passed for some reason.\u201d\n\nThree tips\n\nSkeptics and insiders urge investors to study up before taking the plunge. Specifically:\n\n\u2022 Read everything you can, especially on the management, and don\u2019t just rely on the portal.\n\n\u2022 See how managers are compensated. It\u2019s a problem if they can boost their pay out of the money raised by the crowdfunding campaign, Mr. Seward says, noting that the better deals divide the first profits among investors before the managers get anything.\n\nBecause of the risks, experts warn against dreams of riches with startups. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\n\u2022 Know whether your shares will have voting rights. While private placements through friends and family or brokerages often do include voting rights, crowdfunding deals generally do not, and in fact portals use this as a selling point to startups. Investors are wise to find out if they\u2019ll have any voice or recourse if they\u2019re dissatisfied with management.\n\nBecause of the risks, experts warn against dreams of riches. Be prepared to tie your money up for five to 10 years, and don\u2019t bet the children\u2019s college funds, Mr. Rampton advises, adding, \u201cNine out of 10 companies fail in the first five years.\u201d\n\nMr. Brown is a writer in Livingston, Mont. He can be reached at reports@wsj.com.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nFour online crowdfunding portals\u2014EquityNet, Fundable, AngelList and Crowdfunder\u2014are open to well-to-do \u201caccredited investors.\u201d An earlier version of this article incorrectly implied that they allow nonaccredited investors. Also, Kickstarter was described as a charity portal. It is a rewards portal. In addition, MicroVentures now serves both accredited and nonaccredited investors.

At nearly 3%, on the payment of $7,500, it would have cost more than $200\u2014about as much as one of the plane tickets I had hoped to earn with miles by using the card.\n\nIt turns out that many colleges won\u2019t take plastic, and those that do often charge convenience fees, which aren\u2019t always well disclosed and can outweigh any rewards, says Matt Schulz, senior analyst at credit-card comparison site CreditCards.com.\n\nIn a survey conducted in August 2016, CreditCards.com found only 15 out of the nation\u2019s 100 largest private colleges accept credit cards without a convenience fee, and 35 don\u2019t take credit cards at all. Of the 300 public, private and community colleges surveyed, 85% accept plastic for at least some costs of attendance. But 60% of those schools charge a fee, which averaged 2.62%.\n\nWhy is college tuition an outlier, for the most part, when it comes to the convenience consumers have come to expect for other transactions?\n\nThe fees colleges charge aren\u2019t unusually steep, Mr. Schulz says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that most retailers will bake that price into the cost of products they sell, so the consumer will never see it. That\u2019s just not done with universities.\u201d He says only 8% of community colleges charge a fee because they are more willing to \u201ceat the cost\u201d to attract students.\n\nBoth the University of North Texas and the University of Dayton in Ohio added fees in the past two years, each citing the \u201cprohibitive expense\u201d of processing fees from credit-card companies.\n\nMeanwhile, Pennsylvania State University just dropped its credit-card fee to 1.5% from 2.5%. That was because the school began using an efficient new system and has had good success in fee collection, according to Lisa M. Powers, spokeswoman for Penn State. Ms. Powers says although the school doesn\u2019t advocate using credit cards to finance education, keeping the option available to families was a priority.\n\nUniversity of Notre Dame is among the schools that don\u2019t accept credit cards at all. Eugene M. Pilawski, director of student accounts at Notre Dame, says: \u201cWe all realize that college is expensive, and we\u2019re not looking to raise those costs. We\u2019re looking to contain them.\u201d He adds that colleges that do eat the convenience fee must be making it up elsewhere.\n\nThe Sherman-Luster family traveled from New York to Oregon on miles earned from paying their daughter Priva\u2019s (second from right) tuition by credit card. Photo: Karen Sherman\n\nStill, when a school doesn\u2019t charge a fee and families can use credit cards wisely, the benefits can be significant.\n\nKaren Sherman of New York City used a credit card to pay for her stepdaughter\u2019s tuition at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Fla., and the school didn\u2019t charge a transaction fee. Ms. Sherman says she and her husband then paid off the $14,000-per-semester bill in full, using money set aside for the daughter\u2019s education. Between the miles earned from those payments and credit-card sign-on incentives, the couple has since earned several round-trip airfares for themselves and their two children.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using existing money,\u201d Ms. Sherman says, \u201cthe fact that you can then get this bonus out of it helps ease the pain of the blood, sweat and tears that you\u2019re putting into the process.\u201d\n\nMs. Gallegos is a news editor for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe college-application and decision process just got a bit more complicated.\n\nThat\u2019s because the 2017-2018 college-application cycle marks the first time students and families could apply for federal financial aid in the fall, several months earlier than in the past. The government\u2019s goal in opening the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or Fafsa, on Oct. 1 was to give students and families more time to evaluate their financial-aid options.\n\nStudents and families file a Fafsa, which includes their income and other financial information, as part of the college-application process. Colleges and other institutions that provide financial aid, such as state governments, use the form to determine how much a family can reasonably contribute, how much the institution will provide in grants or other \u201cfree money,\u201d and how much they will ask the family to pay out of pocket or take on in loans.\n\nSo far, it appears that many families are applying for federal aid earlier, says Peter Farrell, a managing director of enrollment services at EAB, a Washington, D.C.-based company that helps colleges manage their enrollment. In a recent survey of EAB\u2019s clients, 41% of participants reported \u201csignificant\u201d early activity in Fafsa filing and 43% said they had moderate early Fafsa activity.\n\nBut while financial-aid experts agree that initiating the Fafsa process earlier will ultimately be a boon to students, by making it possible to receive more detailed offers from schools sooner in the whole application and admissions process, families that have been through the process before may now need to alter the way they approach the next several months.\n\nIf financial-aid offers come in from some schools earlier than in years past, applicants may be tempted to commit to a school earlier, before they\u2019ve received financial-aid offers from all of the schools where they applied.\n\nSome say that colleges, too, may consider adjusting the ways in which they extend offers. For instance, with more applications coming in earlier, the schools will have to decide whether to make offers earlier\u2014and consider how an earlier offer might affect a student\u2019s decision. Families may have to be patient as the schools navigate this uncertain terrain.\n\nHere are answers and advice for questions that parents and prospective college students may have as a result of the new, longer process:\n\nWhat is different about the aid-application process this year?\n\nFor the first time, students can apply for financial aid in the fall, much earlier on in the broader college application process. Ideally, that means that students should have a better sense of whether they can afford a school earlier in the process, assuming schools extend offers earlier as well. The reality is that the new process will take some adjusting. Students need to more closely monitor aid-application deadlines and get their requests in sooner. But they won\u2019t necessarily receive timely aid offers from all of the schools where they applied.\n\nDoes the new Fafsa deadline change when students have to make decisions about which school to attend?\n\nEven though students may see some financial-aid offers trickling in early (more than half of schools surveyed by EAB said they would be sending their offer letters weeks earlier than in the past), students and families should be wary of jumping on the first decent-looking offer that comes their way. The deadline to choose a school is still typically the same: May 1.\n\n\u201cThe last thing you want to do is accept one school\u2019s offer and then have buyer\u2019s remorse four days later when you get another aid offer that\u2019s much more generous,\u201d says Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of Cappex.com, a college and scholarship search site.\n\nIt appears that at least some students are already accepting the earlier offers. Mr. Farrell says more families are sending in their deposits earlier than in the past at a broad array of schools working with EAB. But he adds that even a relatively small difference in financial-aid packages, say $1,000, can balloon over time if a student opts for the less generous package and is forced to assume $1,000 in debt.\n\nHow does the new aid timeline affect early-application options?\n\nJournal Report Podcast Listen to Jillian Berman using the player below, or click here. Subscribe to the Journal Report podcast at wsj.com, on iTunes or Google Play Music.\n\nIt can be helpful. In the past, many colleges offering early notifications of admission were only able to provide an estimate of a student\u2019s financial-aid package with their admission, says Mr. Kantrowitz. Under the new timeline, they\u2019ll be able to include more definitive financial-aid information at the time of acceptance, he says, provided the students took advantage of the earlier aid-application provisions.\n\nIf not all schools give aid offers earlier than in the past\u2014despite receiving the applications earlier\u2014what can students do to best make use of the offers they have received before they hear from the rest?\n\nHaving offers in-hand earlier does give students and families the opportunity to more thoroughly evaluate their options, says Mr. Kantrowitz. For example, if students get a generous aid package from a school that wasn\u2019t initially at the top of their list, they now have more time to take another (or their first) look at the campus and re-evaluate it in this new light.\n\nHaving potentially more time between receiving an offer and having to accept an offer also gives students more time to consider a school with concrete information beyond the glossy brochures provided to them by college staff. \u201cIt removes that gauze in the recruiting relationship,\u201d Mr. Farrell says of the earlier award letters. In the past, the gap between when students applied to a school and when they found out how much it would cost them meant that often college recruiters found themselves trying to push students to fall in love with a school, while knowing that at the end of that process the students may find themselves disappointed because they couldn\u2019t afford it, Mr. Farrell says.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s still going to happen, but the likelihood of that happening as much goes down\u201d with the earlier timeline, he says.\n\nWhat should students do if their families\u2019 finances change between the time they applied for financial aid and the time they receive their award?\n\nThis year, it is more likely than in the past that families\u2019 financial circumstances will have changed between when they filed the Fasfa and when they received their award. That\u2019s because for the first time, in this application cycle, families are required to use their tax information from two years prior. Thus they\u2019re using 2015 tax-year information for the 2017-2018 application year.\n\nDoing it this way encourages families to use the IRS data retrieval tool\u2014since few will have filed their 2016 faxes already\u2014and so increases the odds that their tax information is accurate. Also, Mr. Kantrowitz says, if applicants were given the option to submit tax data from either one or two years prior, they would likely choose the year most beneficial to them. Thus, he says, requiring that the data be from two years earlier ensures consistency.\n\nIf a family\u2019s financial situation has changed considerably in the time between the filing of its tax data and its applying for financial aid\u2014including the loss of a job or a divorce\u2014the family should alert the colleges, which may be willing to create a better aid package.\n\nWhat should families do if they simply want a better award?\n\nFamilies who seek to negotiate an aid offer should appeal to the schools they\u2019re interested in as soon as they receive their award letter, says Mr. Farrell. But if the offer comes early, families should be prepared to be patient as financial-aid officers work through the new financial-aid landscape.\n\nFamilies should update schools with any new information, such as test scores, awards or competitive financial offers from other colleges. Families may also have a better shot at getting schools to listen to their appeal if they identify exactly what it would take\u2014say an extra $5,000\u2014for the student to attend the school.\n\nWith people responding earlier, should you be worried that money will run out?\n\nThe new financial-aid timeline shouldn\u2019t affect a student\u2019s chances of getting aid from individual schools. The Department of Education asked colleges in a memo last year to resist the urge to move up their deadlines for students to apply to receive priority for financial aid.\n\nAbout a dozen states that dole out their grants on a first-come, first-served basis began the financial-aid process earlier to align with the new financial-aid timeline, says Mr. Kantrowitz.\n\nStates that in the past required students to get their paperwork in later, for example, in March or April, generally didn\u2019t move their deadlines any earlier, but it is possible that in the future those states may move up their deadlines, he says. That way states can limit the amount of money they hand out.\n\nMs. Berman is a reporter for MarketWatch.

Photo: Deborah Butterfield and Danese/Corey Gallery\n\nIf you have your eye on a piece of fine art, don\u2019t be surprised if you have to do more than just write a check to purchase it: The gallery offering the piece may also want you to agree in writing not to resell the work at auction\u2014or even to another collector\u2014without getting their permission first.\n\nAdding conditions and restrictions to sales agreements is becoming an increasingly common practice in the art world as dealers, worried that an overheated art-auction market is distorting prices, look to maintain control over who buys the works of the artists they represent.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of fear that art buyers aren\u2019t really collectors but are just looking to flip works,\u201d says lawyer Judd Grossman, who has represented artists, collectors and galleries as part of his New York practice.\n\nDisruptive force\n\nReports both of record high prices and works finding no buyers at auction have proved disruptive to gallery owners, which is why many seek to retain the right to resell pieces originally bought from them.\n\nNew York gallery owner Andrea Rosen says, \u201cI have used these clauses on every invoice since I opened \u201d in 1990.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s hard to blame buyers for wanting to realize the profits being generated by the frothy art-auction market. For example, Deborah Butterfield \u2019s bronze, wood and scrap-metal sculptures of horses have consistently done well at auction, twice fetching highs of $229,000, far exceeding presale estimates of $100,000 to $150,000 at Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s. Yet if you want to buy one of her works at the New York gallery that represents her, you\u2019ll have to sign a contract giving the gallery first dibs on reselling it.\n\nAccording to Renato Danese, co-owner of the Danese/Corey gallery where Ms. Butterfield\u2019s sculptures are sold, the demand is aimed at protecting both the artist and the collectors who buy her works.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see my clients gambling at auction,\u201d says Mr. Danese. \u201cWhat if the work doesn\u2019t sell, or sells below the low estimate? That will hurt the artist in terms of current and future sales, and it will hurt my clients. They will ask me, \u2018Why did you sell me something that wasn\u2019t worth as much as I paid?\u2019 And if the work sells for a very high price at auction, that also disrupts the market because other collectors will then think that prices for every work by the artist should be much higher.\n\nWhat\u2019s the motive?\n\nNot everyone is buying that explanation, however, and some \u201ccollectors complain that gallery control is chiefly for their own benefit,\u201d says New York art lawyer John Cahill. They believe galleries care more about getting another commission than they do about helping artists, he says.\n\nIn some cases, though, it\u2019s the artists themselves who seek to attach conditions to sales.\n\nThe estate of artist Sol LeWitt, for example, has demanded that collectors who buy his works agree to seek its permission before selling to new owners, his former business and studio manager, Susannah Singer, says. Another artist, Hans Haacke, asks buyers to sign a contract agreeing to pay him a royalty of 15% whenever they sell his work for a profit on the secondary market. And if buyers exhibit his work in \u201ca public venue, I want a say in the circumstances,\u201d he says. The reason, according to Mr. Haacke, is that he wouldn\u2019t want his work associated with \u201ccorporations I object to.\u201d\n\nThe degree to which restrictions and conditions are enforceable in court depends on the language of the sales agreement, lawyers say, adding that some galleries may be willing to negotiate.\n\nFor example, you might \u201csay that you will only agree to sell the work back to the gallery, rather than to consign it,\u201d Mr. Cahill, the New York art lawyer, says. Or, you could offer to give the gallery 30 days to buy the piece back from you, but maintain the right to go to auction if you don\u2019t like the price, he says.\n\nPower struggle\n\nBut the threat of a lawsuit may not be the most important element in keeping buyers in line.\n\nCollectors who violate sales agreements may have a tough time working with those same galleries or artists in the future.\n\nNew York art lawyer Susan Duke Biederman says restrictions and conditions are part of \u201ca quid-pro-quo in a larger relationship between dealer and collector. Dealers want to sell to certain collectors, and collectors want to buy what certain dealers are selling. The main issue is who has the most leverage in that relationship.\u201d\n\nMr. Grant is a writer in Amherst, Mass.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/art-plays-a-growing-role-as-collateral-1434054783", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Illustration: Edwin Fotheringham for The Wall Street Journal\n\nA booming art market has many investors viewing their collections in a new way\u2014as cash machines.\n\nWith art prices rising for several years now, many collectors find themselves in the enviable position of owning art that has increased substantially in value. But many don\u2019t want to sell their art to access that wealth.\n\nFortunately for them, banks and smaller, specialist lenders increasingly are offering loans secured by the borrower\u2019s art. A survey last year by Deloitte and ArtTactic Ltd., an art-market research firm, found that 40% of private banks said art-secured lending would be a strategic focus in the coming year, up from just 13% in 2012. And almost half of all art collectors surveyed said they would be interested in such a service.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, we\u2019re seeing that collectors are increasingly demanding ways to provide some liquidity and free up capital,\u201d says Anders Petterson, managing director of London-based ArtTactic and co-author of the report. \u201cAnd on the other hand, we\u2019re starting to see more willingness among banks to offer this type of lending.\u201d\n\nFor collectors, the amount they can borrow, the risk the loan entails and the interest rate all depend on what type of loan they get. Here\u2019s what potential borrowers need to know.\n\nTwo types of loans\n\nArt-secured lending takes two main forms, recourse and nonrecourse. Private banks typically offer recourse loans, meaning the art serves as collateral for the loan but the borrower also has to give a personal guarantee of repayment. That means if the borrower defaults and the bank can\u2019t recover the full amount of the loan by selling the art, it can make a claim on the borrower\u2019s other assets.\n\nA host of smaller lenders, such as Borro, Art Capital Group and Falcon Fine Art, have started offering nonrecourse loans, which don\u2019t require the borrower\u2019s personal guarantee. \u201cWith nonrecourse lending, the only asset that is the security for the loan is the artwork itself,\u201d says Paul Ress, founder of Right Capital Ltd., which offers advisory services and arranges nonrecourse loans. \u201cObviously, in those instances the creditworthiness of the individual is much less important than the art itself.\u201d\n\nMr. Ress says the private banks typically offer much lower rates on recourse loans, because the lender\u2019s risk is lower and the banks view the service as part of an overall relationship with a wealthy client. Borrowers may be able to get rates as low as 2% or 3%, he says. For nonrecourse loans, interest rates vary widely but typically range from 8% to 16%, Mr. Ress says.\n\nThe private banks typically only offer much larger loans, as well. Suzanne Gyorgy, head of the art advisory and finance group at Citigroup \u2019s Citi Private Bank, says her bank\u2019s minimum size for an art-secured loan is $5 million. Since loans typically are around 50% of the appraised value of the art, the borrower\u2019s collection would need to be worth around $10 million or more. And the minimum value of each piece is $200,000.\n\nNonrecourse lenders will often deal with smaller amounts. Borro\u2019s minimum loan size is $100,000. Mr. Ress says he arranges loans of between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a37 million, or about $780,000 to $10.9 million.\n\nFor either type of loan, the art needs to meet certain criteria. First, says Mr. Ress, borrowers need proof of authenticity, such as purchase documents, exhibition history, sale history and inclusion in a catalog. Borrowers also need to prove that they own the art outright, with no possibility of anyone else claiming it in situations like divorce or a disputed inheritance.\n\nAnd certain types of collections make better collateral than others in the eyes of lenders, which may affect whether a borrower can get a loan, how big a loan can be and what interest rate it carries. For instance, Ms. Gyorgy says artworks from ancient civilizations are risky for lenders because of the possibility that the government of the country where they originated will try to recover them. Lenders also consider works with no proven secondary market to be riskier, she says. Citi\u2019s collateral pool is almost equally split between 19th-century Impressionist paintings and postwar/contemporary art, with a smattering of other categories such as old masters and Latin American art, Ms. Gyorgy says.\n\nWhere the money goes\n\nWhy might collectors want to borrow against their art? According to the Deloitte/ArtTactic survey, 53% of collectors who expressed an interest in art-secured lending said their motivation would be to buy more art, while 38% said they\u2019d use the money to invest in other business activities and 9% said they\u2019d use it to refinance existing loans.\n\nMs. Gyorgy says her clients include hedge-fund managers and people in private equity who want to access funds for new investment opportunities. Revolving lines of credit are more popular than term loans because of their flexibility, she says.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nBut if a collector needs liquidity, why not just sell the art? First, says Mr. Ress, because a sale is subject to capital-gains tax. Second, the collector may love the piece and want to keep it. Third, selling through the major auction houses can attract unwanted publicity, especially if the values are large.\n\n\u201cSelling art, particularly a trophy piece, is often considered to be a sign of financial distress,\u201d says Mr. Ress. \u201cAnd some people just don\u2019t like publicity. If you sell a painting at auction for two or three million, it\u2019s just a bit too public.\u201d\n\nMr. Blackman is a writer in Crete.

Retrofret/Aslaender\n\nPeople who collect musical instruments flirt with one of the great pitfalls of investing\u2014the intermingling of financial judgment with emotion. A beguiling violin or guitar can play to the buyer\u2019s heart, if not soul, in a way that few stock certificates, bonds or hog bellies ever will.\n\nSo, investors should consider themselves warned. Having said that, it\u2019s also true that collecting instruments can benefit the portfolio of a knowledgeable and disciplined investor. As a hard asset, instruments can help diversify a portfolio. High-quality instruments generally hold their value well, providing some downside protection. And many have the potential for significant long-term appreciation.\n\nThe challenge is finding the particular instruments that fill that bill and are within the investor\u2019s budget. The market for vintage and collectible musical instruments is vast and diverse, really a collection of smaller markets. It spans everything from multimillion-dollar violins, cellos and violas from the 17th and 18th centuries to $300 acoustic guitars from the 20th century.\n\nAlternative Music\n\nViolins are among the most stable investments in musical instruments. Since the financial crisis, the market for violins has performed similarly to those for other hard assets. \u201cThe higher end has gone up quite a lot in the last five years, despite the economic downturn,\u201d says Frederick W. Oster, the proprietor of Frederick W. Oster Fine Violins in Philadelphia. \u201cI think people turned to them as an alternative asset.\u201d\n\nBut even within the world of fine violins, certain instruments have appreciated faster than others. Italian violins, for example, have appreciated far more quickly than German instruments. \u201cPrices for these violins never seem to go down, the way they do for other kinds of investments,\u201d Mr. Oster says. \u201cBut certain instruments made by certain makers can be steady for a while and then take off, for reasons that we are not always sure of.\u201d\n\nThe inventory in Frederick W. Oster\u2019s Philadelphia shop includes a violin made by Joannes Baptista Guadagnini in 1763 that could sell for $700,000. Catherine Jacobs\n\nOne of the most notable violins Mr. Oster is offering was made by Joseph Guarnerius filius Andreae, who lived from 1666 to 1739 or 1740 in Cremona, Italy, and is the father of the even more famous Joseph Guarnerius, known as del Ges\u00f9, a violin maker regarded as second in greatness only to Antonio Stradivari. Mr. Oster expects the instrument, which is offered on consignment as part of an estate sale, to sell for \u201ca million dollars plus.\u201d Ten years ago, the same violin probably would have fetched about $500,000 to $600,000.\n\nViolins made in Cremona during the city\u2019s golden age of violin making, around 1650 to 1750, are the most highly regarded violins among players and collectors. They are plentiful enough to have a track record, so sellers and buyers have sufficient sales records upon which to base prices.\n\nBeyond sales data, Mr. Oster says dealers rely on their eye and their knowledge of history, as well as experience in literally handling lots of instruments, to make their pricing decisions. They also use a technology called dendrochronology, to date the wood used in instruments. That can identify some cases of fraud, but it can\u2019t, on its own, protect buyers from replicas or overly restored instruments made with vintage wood.\n\nMr. Oster says buyers need to be educated about instruments to make informed decisions and to satisfy themselves that they are buying an instrument that they know to be correct, in good condition and from a reliable source, even if they are relying on expert opinion as well. Auctions can be a good source of information, but prices, which tend to get a lot of attention in the media, aren\u2019t always a good gauge of values in the broader market.\n\nMarket Fads\n\nGuitars can be more of an adventure.\n\n\u201cThe guitar market tends to be a little bit more fad oriented,\u201d says Steve Uhrik, the owner of Retrofret Vintage Guitars in Brooklyn, N.Y. \u201cCollecting musical instruments is a mixed bag. I have been doing this since the early 1970s, and you can really get burned.\u201d\n\nHis inventory includes more than 1,600 instruments,from acoustic and electric guitars to banjos, mandolins, harmonicas and pochette violins\u2014diminutive fiddles that take their name from the French for a small pocket.\n\nRetrofret Vintage Guitars owner Steve Uhrik Retrofret/Hickey\n\nThe market for solid-body electric guitars soared during the 1990s and early 2000s. But prices for many collectible electric guitars dropped about 30% during the financial crisis and haven\u2019t really recovered. And if they do, Mr. Uhrik warns, don\u2019t expect too much: \u201cThere has been a steady climb in prices, but if the market goes crazy, it will not continue at that rate.\u201d\n\nOne big factor in the price of any given instrument is how close the guitar is to its original condition. A seller recently brought Mr. Uhrik a Telecaster, a solid-body electric guitar from the 1950s. \u201cIt was nice looking and it played great,\u201d he says. But when he inspected it under ultraviolet light, he could see that the decal with the logo had been replaced. That cut the value by 25%. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a $15,000 guitar, not a $20,000 guitar,\u201d he says.\n\nThe market for acoustic guitars is different, because people can\u2019t mix and match parts from different guitars and because of the rarity of the guitar\u2019s wood, now often regulated, Mr. Uhrik says. \u201cThat market may have flattened, but it didn\u2019t really go down. The most well-made and best-sounding guitars have held their value.\u201d At the top of the acoustic-guitar market, older Martin D-45s, which are extremely rare, sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nFor collectors who only have a few hundred dollars to invest, there\u2019s still a thriving market. Frankie Basile, of Hopewell, N.J., has a passion for country blues, and has several dozen instruments, many of them acoustic guitars from the early 20th century. He has purchased old Harmony and Stella guitars, which often sell for around $300. \u201cStellas went through an infatuation phase, but now they have contracted a bit,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Basile says he used to buy more-expensive acoustic guitars, but he decided that the country blues he loves didn\u2019t sound quite right when he played them on those instruments. \u201cThe guitars that I now collect have the same voice as the music,\u201d he says.\n\nWhether the market is high-end violins or acoustic guitars, the key to successful investing is to buy instruments that you like and that you understand, according to Mr. Oster. Buyers also have the satisfaction of playing them or lending them out musicians, he says: \u201cThey are a part of musical history, but they still can be used and enjoyed.\u201d\n\nMr. Rosenbush is editor of the The Wall Street Journal\u2019s CIO Journal, based in New York.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/art-collectors-discover-irrevocable-trusts-1459130776", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Property placed in an irrevocable trust, including artwork, no longer is legally part of an estate, which reduces the value of the estate for tax purposes. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nA common estate-planning tool, the irrevocable trust, is increasingly being used for an uncommon purpose: It allows art owners to reap tax savings by transferring ownership of their paintings or other collectible objects, but keep possession so they can still enjoy them.\n\nFirst, the tax savings. Property placed in an irrevocable trust, in this case the art, no longer is legally part of an estate, which reduces the value of the estate for tax purposes.\n\nBut the tax benefits potentially go far beyond removing the art\u2019s current value from the estate. The art, which legally is gifted to the trust, will be appraised for tax purposes at the time of the gift. The amount of the appraised value above the $14,000 annual exemption from gift taxes will be deducted from the owner\u2019s lifetime combined federal gift-tax and estate-tax exemption (currently $5.45 million). Or if that exemption has already been used up, the owner will pay tax on the gift. But in either case, if the owner holds on to the art instead, there is a chance it will be appraised at a much higher amount when he or she dies, resulting in a much bigger tax liability for the estate.\n\n\u201cBasically, you are sheltering the appreciation,\u201d says Michael Kosnitzky, a partner in charge of the tax and middle market practice group at the law firm of Boies, Schiller & Flexner. The cost of setting up a trust varies, generally not exceeding $15,000, depending on the trust\u2019s complexity and the jurisdiction of the trust, but the potential tax savings outweigh the setup costs, Mr. Kosnitzky says.\n\nRenting Renoir\n\nThe trust will take responsibility for storage and care of the art, with money provided by the benefactor to cover the cost. But what if you don\u2019t want to give up your art? You don\u2019t have to.\n\n\u201cWith art prices increasing, there is interest in the idea of putting your art in a trust to shelter the appreciation, and then renting it back, so that you can hang it on your walls,\u201d says Diana Wierbicki, partner and global head of art law at the law firm Withers Bergman. \u201cPeople say, you can do it with a house, why not with art?\u201d (People more commonly place their home in an irrevocable trust and then continue to live in the home and pay market-value rent to the trust.)\n\nOne complication is that determining a fair-market rent is much more difficult for art than it is for real estate, because the market is so much more limited. The rent matters a lot to the Internal Revenue Service, which might disallow a trust if auditors conclude that the trust isn\u2019t being paid enough. \u201cYou have to look at the optics,\u201d says Tim Bresnahan, vice president in the wealth-planning advisory services group at Chicago-based Northern Trust. \u201cIf a collector puts artwork in a trust and then leases it back for a dollar, that would be a clear violation of trustee duties and responsibilities.\u201d\n\nThe problem for taxpayers, Ms. Wierbicki says, is that the IRS has \u201cnot provided a safe-harbor methodology\u201d\u2014it hasn\u2019t set the rules\u2014for determining fair market value of art rentals.\n\nSo what should an art owner do? Mr. Kosnitzky recommends hiring an art leasing firm to set a rental price. Joshua Ginsberg, owner and chief executive of Chicago Art Leasing, which rents artwork by emerging contemporary artists to Chicago-area businesses, says his company\u2019s monthly leases tend to range from 5% to 7% of the retail price of a work of art. At New York City-based Artemus, which leases artworks to corporations and individuals, the monthly rental fee is between 6% and 12% of the appraised value, according to the company\u2019s chief operating officer, Cedric Autet. The lower-percentage rental fees are generally for more highly valued works\u2014done by established artists and in good condition\u2014to make the absolute amount of those fees more affordable.\n\nThe heirs\u2019 side\n\nWhat do the beneficiaries of a trust get out of all this? Property, such as art, that has been placed in trust for one\u2019s children or anyone else doesn\u2019t belong to the beneficiary or beneficiaries but rather is owned by the trust. The children, say, may enjoy the art but can\u2019t sell it\u2014only the trust can do that.\n\nEventually, of course, the heirs may come to own the artwork, either upon the benefactor\u2019s death or at a later time designated by the benefactor in the terms of the trust. The art may remain in trust as long as permissible under state law (usually, the life of the benefactor plus 21 years, though in some cases it may be longer). Another possibility is that the terms of the trust dictate that the art be sold and the proceeds be given to the beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cAssuming that heirs eventually do gain ownership of the art, if they were to sell objects from that trust, they would pay capital-gains taxes at the appreciated value, not at the lower value when the trust was first created,\u201d Mr. Kosnitzky says. If the trust sells the art, it would pay the same taxes. The taxable amount would be the difference between the value at the time of the sale and the \u201ctax basis,\u201d which generally is the amount paid for the art by the donor, Mr. Kosnitzky says.\n\nMr. Grant is a writer in Amherst, Mass.

Photo: Brandon Schulman for The Wall Street Journal\n\nSomewhere between their first birthday and their first kiss, many children fall in love\u2014with their toys. And it is a love affair that can last a lifetime.\n\nFor some investors and dealers, there is money in those old loves, as they look to reconnect people with the actual games that were consigned to memory (and the trash) so long ago. \u201cWhen people want to relive their childhood, they will pay almost anything,\u201d says Joyce Grant, founder of TimeWarpToys.com, an online vintage toy store that she operates from Phoenicia, N.Y. \u201cIt is crazy sometimes.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, the market for vintage toys is diverse and presents collectors and investors with a number of potential hazards, including the risks of impulse buying or outrageous prices sought at auction. But collectors say disciplined and informed investors can make money in the vintage toy market\u2014and have some fun along the way.\n\nValuable Qualities\n\nWhile prices for certain collectible toys have soared recently, there are segments of the toy market still priced within reason that offer the potential for decent returns, experts say. One such segment is vintage games.\n\n\u201cGames are not in as much demand as some toys, but if they are attached to the right [licensed television, movie or comic-book franchise], they can go through the roof,\u201d says Jordan Hembrough, a toy-collecting expert and founder of Hollywood Heroes Inc., a vintage toy dealer in Westwood, N.J. Mr. Hembrough hosted a TV show, Toy Hunter, that ran on the Travel Channel from 2012 to 2014.\n\nPredicting which board games are poised to rise in value can be challenging. In general, however, games that are rare, feature an unusual twist or are tied to a franchise from a bygone era that is enjoying a resurgence in popularity tend to draw interest from collectors, dealers say. \u201cBe aware of the media, and what is happening. Watch for movies and TV shows that are becoming hot,\u201d Mr. Hembrough advises. And look for games in pristine condition. That can have a huge impact on prices.\n\nA pristine King Kong game, which was first issued in 1976, can go for as much as $100. Photo: Brandon Schulman for The Wall Street Journal\n\nDemand for vintage board games associated with the Universal Studios monster movies of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s has surged in recent years, inspired in part by rising interest in other collectibles from the same era, dealers say. Games in perfect condition featuring Dracula, Frankenstein or the Wolfman can fetch $1,000, says Mr. Hembrough. He says he sold a still-sealed 1963 Creature from the Black Lagoon game by Hasbro a few years ago for $2,000. A King Kong game from Ideal Corp., first published in 1976, might fetch as much as $100, but only if it is in immaculate condition, he says.\n\nMs. Grant of TimeWarpToys has noticed that demand for 1960s and 1970s games is growing. \u201cYounger people are buying them for their parents,\u201d she says. Her inventory includes a 1963 Jungle Hunt shooting game for $400. Ice Cube, a Milton Bradley game that employs actual ice cubes as playing pieces, goes for $325. And who can forget Mystery Date? \u201cIt sells for $200, in a nice box and complete,\u201d she says.\n\nSome games are collectible simply because they are unique. Which Witch?, a 3-D board game from the 1970s shaped like a haunted house, sold recently at Hollywood Heroes for $200, says Mr. Hembrough. It would have fetched $40 or $50 five years ago, but a growing appreciation for the unusual 3-D design drove up the price, he says. Green Ghost, a game from 1965 featuring glow-in-the dark pieces and notable because it was meant to be played in the dark, might command as much as $500, he says, calling it one of the most sought after games on the market not attached to a license.\n\nLimited-edition versions of classic games can sometimes fetch good prices. Franklin Mint issued a version of Monopoly in 1991 that looked like the original 1935 Parker Brothers edition and had gold-plated charms. Mr. Hembrough says he sold one in December for $800, hundreds more than it would have sold for a few years earlier.\n\nLike Sunday Dinners\n\nFor enthusiasts such as 42-year-old Frank Rucco, who grew up playing games like Battleship, Mouse Trap and Stratego in Yonkers, N.Y., \u201ccollecting games is all about trying to recapture a really cool moment in your life.\u201d\n\nThose games were like Sunday dinners in that they \u201cbrought the whole family together,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Rucco, who has dedicated a room in his Nanuet, N.Y., townhouse to the games of his youth, says the Facebook fan page of the Retroland TV channel offers inspiration on collecting and buying. His biggest piece of advice for collectors, though, is to \u201cstay within your means.\u201d The game you want will always be there later, he says.\n\nMr. Hembrough also offers a word of caution: \u201cThe collectible market, just like mutual funds or stocks, is not a sure thing. Nothing is ironclad.\u201d Clearly, toys and comics shouldn\u2019t be anyone\u2019s only investment, he says. \u201cAs with everything, you want to be diversified.\u201d\n\nMr. Rosenbush is the editor of CIO Journal in New York.

Illustration: Richard Borge for The Wall Street Journal\n\nImagine this scenario: Somebody offers you $5,000 to save for a future financial goal,such as a vacation or home purchase. You can allocate the money across three accounts, all with the same interest rate. The first account comes with no restrictions, meaning you can withdraw the money whenever you want. The second account comes with a 10% penalty if you withdraw the money within the first year. The third account prohibits withdrawals within the first year.\n\nHow would you allocate the $5,000? Economic theory predicts that most people, not wanting to limit access to their own money, would put the entire amount in the unrestricted account.\n\nJournal Report Podcast Listen to Schlomo Benartzi using the player above, or click here. Subscribe to the Journal Report podcast at wsj.com, on iTunes or Google Play Music.\n\nHowever, a new working paper (by John Beshears, James Choi, Christopher Harris, David Laibson, Brigitte Madrian and Jung Sakong ), suggests the opposite\u2014that people actually prefer putting some of their money into accounts with severe restrictions. When these researchers asked a sample of Americans the same question posed above, approximately 80% put at least some of their money in one of the two accounts that made it much more costly (if not impossible) to withdraw the funds early.\n\nIn another version of the study, the researchers offered people only two accounts to choose from: the account with no withdrawal restrictions and a single restricted account. They now allocated nearly half of their money to the restricted account. What\u2019s more, the amount of money they allocated increased with the level of restrictiveness. They even allocated money to the restricted account when it offered a lower interest rate than the unrestricted one.\n\nIn other words, restricted accounts are so appealing that people appear to be willing to give up money just to get one. And that willingness holds important clues to ways individuals, lawmakers and institutions may be able to close the gap between what experts say people should be saving for retirement and other financial goals and what they actually are saving.\n\nProtection from yourself\n\nTo understand why, you need to understand what accounts for the appeal of restricted accounts. One piece of evidence comes from a similar, older field study of Filipino households: After one year, the Filipino families that chose to use a restricted account increased their savings by 337% compared with a control group. They saved more because they weren\u2019t able to spend; the restrictions were a necessary protection against the usual failures of self-control.\n\nThe same logic applies to the American subjects in the Beshears study. Many of the people who chose to allocate money to the restricted accounts were aware of their limited self-control\u2014it\u2019s hard to save in a world that\u2019s always trying to get you to buy\u2014and so they chose financial products that made it easy to make the prudent choice. In short, they wanted to protect their future selves from their present selves.\n\nBehavioral economists refer to such restricted accounts as \u201ccommitment devices.\u201d Although commitment devices might violate the predictions of classical economics, they already are a staple of our financial lives.\n\nTake retirement savings: Americans currently have nearly 15 trillion in assets in accounts such as 401(k) plans and IRAs, according to data from the Investment Company Institute, a trade group. Those types of accounts come with a 10% tax penalty if funds are withdrawn before a person turns 59\u00bd years old. (Of course, these retirement savings accounts offer tax benefits, so the source of their popularity is multidimensional.)\n\nThis latest research suggests that it might be possible for lawmakers to make retirement accounts even more restrictive\u2014and increase retirement savings\u2014without reducing the appeal of such accounts to consumers. In the Beshears study, for instance, accounts with a 10% penalty were less desirable than accounts with a 20% penalty, which were less desirable than accounts that prohibited early withdrawals altogether. These people seemed to realize that a 10% early-withdrawal penalty wouldn\u2019t be sufficient protection for their savings: they needed stronger restrictions to keep their savings safe.\n\nCommitment devices\n\nThe pull of immediate gratification is reflected in the data from existing 401(k) accounts. Consider 401(k) cash outs, which occur when people liquidate their retirement accounts before they reach retirement age. Research from Aon Hewitt, a human-resources consulting firm, shows that among people changing jobs, about one-third keep their 401(k) account at the original employer, one-third roll over the account into an IRA and another third liquidate it.\n\nWhile people liquidate their accounts for a variety of reasons\u2014some need the money, others just find liquidation easier than rolling it over\u2014the vast majority of workers come to regret that decision. One recent survey by Warren Cormier of the Boston Research Group found that approximately 80% of people who liquidated their last retirement account regretted the decision, with 60% saying it was a \u201cmajor\u201d source of regret. Given this data, it shouldn\u2019t be too surprising that many people want highly restricted savings accounts.\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThis returns us to the original question: How did you allocate your $5,000?\n\nIf you allocated a significant amount of money to the illiquid accounts, then you may want to consider making commitment devices part of your financial life. Whatever your goal\u2014maybe it\u2019s saving for a kitchen remodel, or finally paying off those credit cards\u2014you can generate your own commitment device by imposing a penalty on yourself if you don\u2019t follow the plan, and finding another person who can enforce the penalty if you break your promise to yourself. (There also are websites that can help you do this.)\n\nHowever you create it, a commitment device makes it possible to leverage your dislike of losses to increase your chances of future success. Sometimes, the best way to boost self-control is to acknowledge how little we have.\n\n\u2014David Laibson contributed to this article.\n\nDr. Benartzi, a frequent contributor to the Journal Report, is a professor and co-head of the behavioral decision-making group at UCLA Anderson School of Management.

Photo: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg News\n\nMany investors have reaped hefty returns from real-estate funds in recent years, but there are signs that the party may be winding down.\n\nThat\u2019s because the prices of buildings\u2014and the stocks of the companies that own income-producing real estate (known as real-estate investment trusts, or REITs)\u2014are high. Commercial property prices have risen so much since the financial crisis that investors already have captured much of the future profits that real estate likely will deliver.\n\nJust how good was the run? Investors in Vanguard REIT Index Fund (VGSIX), for example, achieved 15.5% annualized returns from 2009 through 2016. Over that same time, the fund\u2019s assets swelled above $60 billion from less than $10 billion.\n\nWith the help of Research Affiliates, a Newport Beach, Calif., investment firm, we came up with a way to estimate the likely future returns of REITs. The formula starts with dividend yield, adjusts it for property-maintenance costs, and then factors in an element of price, or how properties are trading relative to their history. Based on that formula, we predict REIT returns over the next decade won\u2019t be nearly as robust as they have been over the past five years. Here is a closer look:\n\n1. First, dividend yield\n\nReal-estate investors estimating future returns of a commercial property start with the current rent minus basic expenses such as repairs, insurance, and taxes. That number\u2014often called net operating income by real-estate pros\u2014is the current profit properties are delivering to investors. Investors typically consider net operating income in relation to the price of property to arrive at what\u2019s called a capitalization rate\u2014or a rough estimate of an investor\u2019s return on investment from a property or a portfolio of properties.\n\nA Research Affiliates paper by Michael Aked and Jim Masturzo uses a capitalization rate or income per unit of price as the first component of return. In an interview, Messrs. Aked and Masturzo said investors in REITs or REIT mutual funds could simply substitute dividend yield for the capitalization rate as the first input of the return model. (A REIT\u2019s dividend yield is typically covered by the cash remaining after collecting rent and paying basic expenses.)\n\nAccording to Research Affiliates, the capitalization rate of commercial real estate has been falling, from 7%-8% in the 1980s and 1990s to 5.5% in the past five years. The Research Affiliates model used 4.6% for current profit when it was published in August 2016. The current dividend yield of U.S. REIT indexes is around 4%, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s.\n\n2. Maintenance costs\n\nAfter current profit, the second component of the model is the capital required to maintain properties over the longer haul. These aren\u2019t day-to-day repairs but rather bigger projects that are more expensive and necessary to maintain the quality of the property. They include replacing roofs and refurbishing kitchens and bathrooms, among other things. Messrs. Aked and Masturzo argue that landlords have spent 2% of the value of their property a year to maintain the property at \u201cconstant quality,\u201d or to keep it in the condition it was when first completed.\n\nLetting the property deteriorate, maintaining it only at \u201cminimum quality,\u201d can boost profit at first, but ultimately erodes the property\u2019s value and future profitability. Alternatively, maintaining property at \u201ccurrent quality\u201d of technology, amenities and building standards, as opposed the standards of its own completion date, drains too much cost that can\u2019t be recouped in big enough rent increases.\n\nDifferent property types may require different levels of expenditure. REIT funds own a mixture of property types, making the 2% annual long-term \u201cconstant quality\u201d maintenance cost reasonable.\n\nThat means REIT investors should cut the roughly 4% dividend yield by 2 percentage points, leaving a 2% annualized return before factoring in the third element of the model.\n\n3. Price change\n\nThe third component of the forecast is the constant-quality price change. Research Affiliates estimates that constant-quality prices are 20% above their long-term trend, which is a rough proxy for replacement cost, the amount for which a builder would build and sell a building. If that 20% premium shrinks, it could cut into the next decade\u2019s already paltry 2% annualized real return.\n\nSome good news for investors is that developers haven\u2019t been active in creating new supply. Messrs. Aked and Masturzo say credit is tightening. Without credit flowing freely and new development occurring, prices of commercial real estate can remain high and investors can keep the expected 2% real return.\n\nMorris Chen, who heads commercial mortgage-backed securities and commercial real estate at DoubleLine Capital, says money-center bank lending for new projects has been tepid. He, too, expects lower commercial-property returns over the next decade.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s possible that new development activity could send real prices down by around 2% a year over the next decade, in which case REIT investors wouldn\u2019t make any real return. Either way, investors almost certainly won\u2019t achieve anything like the 15% annualized returns domestic REITs have delivered since 2009. Investors may want to continue holding a small allocation in REITs, but those who have piled into the sector with gusto recently, hoping for continued torrid returns, should lower their expectations.\n\nMr. Coumarianos, a former Morningstar analyst, is a writer in Laguna Niguel, Calif.

Bloomberg News\n\nIn the era of social media, charity begins the moment disaster hits.\n\nAnd that isn\u2019t always a good thing\u2014at least for some donors.\n\nThe onslaught of man-made and natural disasters in recent years and accompanying pleas for aid can create pitfalls for well-meaning philanthropists. Giving quickly without prior planning could mean donors veer from their desired financial and charitable objectives, give to an organization that isn\u2019t effective, or fall for a scam.\n\nDonors can be particularly vulnerable when pleas come on the heels of a disaster in one\u2019s own city or town. A big reason Boston\u2019s mayor and the governor of Massachusetts launched One Fund Boston the day after the Boston Marathon bombing was to beat an expected crush of competing funds, and prevent donations from getting \u201cinto the hands of bad actors,\u201d a fund spokeswoman says. One Fund Boston aided victims of the 2013 attack.\n\nRethinking Efforts\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a phenomenon in the disaster-philanthropy world known as pop-up organizations\u2014organizations that pop up sometimes for good purposes, and sometimes not-so-good purposes, during and after a disaster,\u201d says Robert Ottenhoff, president and chief executive of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, a Washington, D.C.-based charity.\n\nJust as television exposed Americans to the realities of the Vietnam War and helped change the course of that conflict, today\u2019s technologies are altering disaster giving, says Nancy Gardiner, director of family office and philanthropy services at Hemenway & Barnes LLC, a Boston legal and financial advisory firm. In addition to news media coverage, citizen journalists post text and stream videos from the middle of war zones or natural-disaster areas, immediately communicating their impact. Urgent pleas for aid circulate swiftly via email, Twitter postings and banner ads online.\n\n\u201cWhat with Sandy Hook, superstorm Sandy, the Boston Marathon bombing, etc., we have found that our clients have almost an annual call to contribute to address a crisis of some kind,\u201d says Ms. Gardiner.\n\nWhen creating their financial plans, she suggests that clients set aside funds for an immediate response to local or international disaster-relief efforts in addition to funds for long-term giving. Since many of her clients who make large charitable gifts are used to setting cash aside for their own unexpected needs, the approach seems natural, she says.\n\nHaving a budget for each can help donors have their cake and eat it, too, by supporting disaster-relief efforts while still concentrating giving on the philanthropic goals that matter most to them. Setting limits in this way forces a donor to make some tough decisions, possibly having to say no to some worthy causes, says Amy Danforth, president of Fidelity Charitable, an independent public charity. But at the same time, it helps prevent their planned giving from losing its effectiveness.\n\nOne of the best ways to support multiple causes and be ready for disasters at the same time, Ms. Gardiner says, is to use donor-advised funds. These are charitable investment funds, offered by the major fund companies, that help individuals fund multiple charities on an ongoing basis. The donors get tax breaks on the money put into the funds. The fund advisers then manage the investment and the disbursal of the funds, following plans outlined by the donors.\n\nMs. Gardiner says clients can ask the fund advisers to make disaster-relief donations that are related to their overall philanthropic goals as well, for example, by focusing on a particular region or specifying that the funds should go toward ensuring food, security, shelter, animal health or water quality.\n\nThe Long Haul\n\nWhile it can help to have accounts set up in advance, some advisers encourage taking a bit of time before giving when a catastrophe strikes. Doing so helps donors step away from the emotions of the moment and decide where they really want to focus their giving.\n\nIn addition, there are longer-term needs that arise after a disaster. Donations that come in the building process, for example, are often appreciated by charities that take part in a disaster-relief effort for the long haul, as donations generally taper off quickly after news coverage lessens.\n\n\u201cThese are the nonsexy ways to give, and they tend to be overlooked in the emotion of the first two weeks\u201d after a disaster, says Ms. Danforth.\n\nAnother consideration: Ms. Danforth notes that some charities that crop up immediately following a disaster aren\u2019t likely to be tax-exempt under the Internal Revenue Code. Obtaining such a designation takes time, she explains.\n\nIn some cases, however, a start-up disaster fund will apply immediately for tax-exempt status and be able to apply that status retroactively to donations made before the status was made official.\n\nOne Fund Boston, for example, did not have tax-exempt status when it was launched less than 24 hours after the April 15, 2013, bombing. But it received approval from the IRS a month later, and because it did, earlier contributions were tax deductible. However, if an organization\u2019s application for the status is denied, contributions made to that organization would not be tax deductible.\n\nOne way to avoid potential fraudulent charitable requests, particularly in international disaster relief, says Gavin Morrissey, senior vice president of wealth management at Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Mass., is to support large domestic charities, such as the American Red Cross, that partner with groups in the affected nation.\n\nAnother alternative is to give now to organizations that are continuously involved with disaster relief, says Mike Penfield, national director of U.S. Bank\u2019s Charitable Services Group.

Photo: Jonathan Cramer\n\nDigital disruption notwithstanding, book collecting appears to be alive and well, sustained in part by the very same people who are driving adoption of smartphones, tablets, e-readers and the like.\n\nTake JT Bachman, a 28-year-old architect with Rockwell Group in New York. He gets his news from digital sources but prefers printed material when reading for pleasure and says he has become a recent convert to book collecting. Mr. Bachman says he has about 100 new, used and out-of-print titles on his shelves, including the architectural tome \u201cHerzog & de Meuron: Natural History\u201d by Pierre de Meuron and Jacques Herzog, and plans on buying more.\n\n\u201cI started collecting books because it is a way to catalog time,\u201d Mr. Bachman says. \u201cI want to keep them for the longer term.\u201d\n\nDealers such as Strand Bookstore near New York\u2019s Union Square and Freebird Books on the Brooklyn waterfront are counting on that kind of passion, as the rise of digital media and higher commercial real-estate prices decimate other corners of the bookselling business.\n\nStrand, an 88-year-old purveyor of new and used books, says business has been good lately, helped in part by the popularity of its rare-book room, where a signed first edition of \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d by Madeleine L\u2019Engle can be had for $5,000 and where a book edited and signed by Jackie Kennedy recently sold for $900.\n\nLast year \u201cwas one of the strongest years in Strand history,\u201d says Strand marketing manager Brianne Sperber, 25, who insists it\u2019s \u201cwrong\u201d to think people in their 20s and 30s don\u2019t want to switch back and forth between digital and print. \u201cI know a lot of people my age who read the way I do,\u201d she says.\n\nMs. Sperber says demand for rare and collectible books has been more or less stable over the past few years, an assessment echoed by Freebird owner Peter Miller, whose specialty is books about New York, and Thomas A. Goldwasser, a veteran rare-book dealer in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think demand for rare books has diminished as a result of digital platforms,\u201d says Mr. Goldwasser, 62, whose office houses more than 4,000 rare volumes. At the same time, Mr. Goldwasser says he hasn\u2019t noticed prices appreciating greatly over the past 10 years or so, either.\n\nWith that in mind, he and a few other insiders have this advice for would-be collectors:\n\nDo it for love\n\nAnnette Campbell-White, the founder of venture-capital firm MedVenture Associates, in Emeryville, Calif., says collectors should be driven by their interest in books, not by the prospect of financial gain. \u201cI wouldn't encourage anyone looking for a quick profit to turn to book collecting,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you make money, it is incidental.\u201d\n\nA 1936 commemorative pamphlet for the opening of New York\u2019s Triborough Bridge is currently selling for $60 at Freebird Books. Photo: Jonathan Cramer\n\nMs. Campbell-White says she got hooked on book collecting in 1973 when she was 25 and over the years amassed collections of poetry from the World War I era, as well as copies of books that were included in literary critic Cyril Connelly \u2019s \u201cThe Modern Movement, 100 Key Books from England, France and America, 1880-1950.\u201d She sold two-thirds of her Modern Movement collection in a private auction at Sotheby\u2019s in 2007. \u201cYes, I made money, about a 40% profit over 30 years,\u201d she says. \u201cNot a good investment.\u201d\n\nDarren Sutherland, manager of the rare-book room at Strand, advises collectors to \u201calways buy the best combination of condition and edition that you can afford, and buy what you love, not because you have a suspicion it might go up in value.\u201d First editions can command higher prices, as can books with unusual inscriptions by the author. Original manuscripts are often valuable, too.\n\nLike everything else, he says, book values are \u201cdriven by supply, which is largely stationary, and demand. So on a smaller scale, some prices can be affected in the short term by cultural events, the death of an author, a new biography or film. But in the longer term, the demand will be set by larger forces, a long-standing cultural reassessment of an author\u2019s work and their effect on our history, or a cultural shift in terms of what we consider to be important.\u201d\n\nWatch out for bubbles\n\nDealers note that a book doesn\u2019t have to be old to be collectible. Honey & Wax Booksellers, an online dealer founded by Strand veteran Heather O\u2019Donnell, offers a 1990 edition of Maira Kalman \u2019s \u201cMax Makes A Million\u201d for $125. The popularity of the author and the book, as well as the quality of the art and production, can drive the value of newer works. Says Mr. Goldwasser: \u201cMany younger collectors are drawn to books for their decorative or atmospheric quality.\u201d Illustrated books and graphic novels are popular today, he says, while demand for photography books has leveled off.\n\nPrices for collectible books can fall, too\u2014sometimes significantly. The first editions of books by some late 20th century authors went through a bubble in the late 1990s, only to fall some 50% from their peak a few years later, Mr. Goldwasser says.\n\nCollectible books are bought and sold in stores, at book fairs and auctions and, like everything else, online. When buying on the Internet, however, collectors should focus on the online dealer\u2019s reputation and track record because they won\u2019t be able to physically inspect the merchandise before sale, says Ms. Campbell-White.\n\nMr. Rosenbush is the editor of CIO Journal in New York.

But not by much.\n\nTo be precise, according to a new study, there is evidence that the phenomenon of stocks performing better in winter than in summer does tend to occur. However, almost all of the advantage comes in the third year of presidential terms. Otherwise, the seasonal difference is so weak as to be statistically nonexistent.\n\nThese are the implications of research now circulating by Kam Fong Chan, a senior lecturer in finance at the University of Queensland in Australia, and Terry Marsh, an emeritus finance professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and CEO of Quantal International, a risk-management firm for institutional investors.\n\nHistorical record\n\nConsider the Dow Jones Industrial Average back to 1896, when this indicator was created. In the first, second and fourth years of all presidential terms since, there was just a 1-percentage-point difference between the Dow\u2019s average winter and summer returns\u20143.3% versus 2.3%. Given the considerable variation in the year-to-year results, this difference turns out to be not significant at the 95% confidence level that statisticians typically use when determining whether a pattern is genuine.\n\nThird years are the exception. During such years over the past 12 decades, there was an 11-percentage-point difference between the stock market\u2019s average winter and summer. That spread is highly significant statistically.\n\nAnother implication of this new research is that there is no reason to get out of stocks most summers\u2014including this coming one. The Dow rose in three of the four summers during Barack Obama\u2019s second term, by an average of 3.9%. The third summer was the exception.\n\nThe researchers became even more confident in their conclusions after searching for the Halloween Indicator in the stock markets of several foreign countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, Australia and Singapore. Just as in the U.S., the seasonal difference in other countries\u2019 stock markets was most pronounced in the third years of the U.S. presidential term but was otherwise not statistically significant.\n\nOne explanation\n\nTo avoid the calendar completely, consider a low-cost index fund. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nWhat might cause the stock market to perform so much better in the winters of presidential third years than in the summers of those years? The professors offer only a conjecture. They point to a 2013 University of Chicago study that created an index measuring uncertainty surrounding economic policy. That index turns out to be highest in the winter months of presidential third years, on average. Drawing on standard principles from Finance 101, they reason that the stock market may well be providing a higher return during those times to compensate investors for the greater uncertainty.\n\nFor most investors, of course, the best advice remains to buy and hold a low-cost index fund\u2014such as Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), with an expense ratio of just 0.05%, or $5 per $10,000 invested.\n\nMr. Hulbert is the founder of the Hulbert Financial Digest and a senior columnist for MarketWatch.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-guide-to-picking-the-right-trust-1415569562", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "For many investors, trusts are an ideal way to keep portfolios safer for the long term.\n\nThe hard part is knowing what kind of trusts to set up and how to do it.\n\nTrusts can protect assets from taxes and legal threats, and provide income for family and descendants for years to come. But if a trust isn\u2019t set up correctly, it can be ignored by the courts. Safeguards set up for family members may no longer exist, or planned tax savings may no longer be in effect.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at several kinds of trusts, which ones work best for whom, and mistakes to avoid.\n\nIrrevocable Life Insurance Trust\n\nWhat It Is: This is used to buy life insurance on behalf of the person establishing the trust. The trust owns the insurance and pays the premium, and the benefits are paid into the trust. That way, the death benefit is isolated from estate tax, says Joan Crain, wealth strategist at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.\n\nLife-insurance payouts can raise the risk that the insured\u2019s estate will be taxable. And if the estate is already taxable, the payouts make the taxes worse, says Robert Weiss, the global head of J.P. Morgan Private Bank\u2019s Advice Lab.\n\nWith a trust, the payouts won\u2019t increase the beneficiary\u2019s estate. The death benefit can be paid immediately or stay in trust for generations. The insured can put more than one policy into a single trust, or create multiple trusts for different beneficiaries. Policies in a trust also have some creditor protections.\n\nBest for: The trusts are ideal for someone younger, who can obtain life insurance at affordable rates, and wants to protect any large insurance benefits from facing estate taxes.\n\nMistakes Often Made: Mr. Weiss says he has seen people set up a trust but never put the policy into it; others pay the premiums from their personal assets rather than from the trust. In such cases, those payments are not protected from any wealth-transfer taxes.\n\nGranter Retained Annuity Trust\n\nWhat It Is: Also known as GRATs, these trusts are typically short term, most commonly two to five years, and allow people to transfer their wealth to family members with little to no exposure to wealth-transfer taxes.\n\nThe granter places assets\u2014such as cash, stocks or bonds\u2014into the trust and each year receives an annuity payment. At the end of the trust\u2019s term, if the trust\u2019s assets have outperformed a \u201churdle rate\u201d set by the IRS\u2014also known as the 7520 rate\u2014those excess returns are distributed to the trust\u2019s beneficiaries or into another trust, free of gift and estate tax, J.P. Morgan says.\n\nIn recent years, low interest rates have resulted in an especially low hurdle rate, giving people more confidence their assets will outperform.\n\nBest for: GRATs are ideal for granters who want to pass on assets to their own children while avoiding a hefty wealth-transfer tax. Through these short-term trusts, investors often try to take advantage of market volatility, placing assets in the trust that are expected to perform well in the next few years.\n\nMistakes Often Made: One critical point: The granter must survive the term of the trust. If the granter dies before the trust reaches the end of its term, the trust collapses and the assets are returned to the granter\u2019s estate.\n\nDynasty Trust\n\nWhat It Is: These trusts allow families to use wealth-transfer tax exemptions of up to $5.34 million per person to place assets into trust and let them grow untouched. \u201cThe idea there is that you\u2019re creating a family resource that\u2019s a pool for future generations,\u201d says Carol Kroch, managing director of wealth and philanthropic planning at Wilmington Trust Co.\n\nBest for: They are for individuals thinking very, very long term. Then later, the trust can make tax-free distributions to the granter\u2019s children, grandchildren or future generations. The trust can specify whether beneficiaries will have access to its income or principal, and when. Such trusts can provide a great deal of tax savings.\n\nMistakes Often Made: Not all states allow dynasty trusts. Delaware, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Idaho and Louisiana are among the states that do.\n\nAlso, granters should use the trusts for assets they are confident will appreciate. If they use a wealth-transfer tax exemption to fund a trust with a stock that falls in value, the exemption ends up being wasted, Mr. Weiss says.\n\nQualified Personal Residence Trust\n\nWhat It Is: A homeowner can place a residence in this trust\u2014often a second home\u2014to transfer the property later without paying full transfer taxes. The granter pays gift tax when the home goes into the trust, but on a reduced value of the house, since they reserve the right to live in it for the term of the trust, according to BNY Mellon Wealth Management. The value of the home for gift-tax purposes is the fair market value minus the present value of the granter\u2019s right to use it during the length of the trust (calculated using an IRS formula), J.P. Morgan says.\n\nThe trust lasts a certain number of years, and when it ends, the beneficiaries\u2014often children\u2014will own the residence. Any appreciation of the home since being placed in the trust is transferred to beneficiaries free of gift and estate tax. If the granter dies before the trust\u2019s term ends, the home is transferred back to the granter\u2019s estate.\n\nBest for: People with vacation homes who know they want to give them away to their children or other family members down the line.\n\nMistakes Often Made: These trusts are most beneficial when interest rates are higher, since that results in a lower gift-tax value on the residence when it is placed in the trust.\n\nRevocable Living Trust\n\nWhat It Is: This is a trust created to hold and protect assets during an individual\u2019s lifetime. While it doesn\u2019t provide any tax savings, it does protect assets from probate. The individual creating the trust can also assign a successor trustee in the case of his/her death or incapacitation, which is a critical benefit, says Ms. Crain.\n\nBest for: A revocable living trust makes sense for someone middle-aged or older who has money or investments that \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t want the court to take over if there\u2019s something that happens to them,\u201d Ms. Crain says. It also could be a good fit for someone seeking privacy, as a living trust is shielded from public scrutiny, rather than the estate being settled through probate, she adds.\n\nMistakes Often Made: Some investors don\u2019t put all the assets they should in the trust, so those assets are not protected from probate, Mr. Weiss says.\n\nCharitable Remainder Trust\n\nWhat It Is: Here, a granter puts assets into a trust and takes at least a 5% income interest, or assigns it to another beneficiary. What is left at the end of the trust\u2019s term goes to charity, and the granter receives an income-tax deduction for that amount, says Ms. Kroch of Wilmington Trust. The beneficiaries pay income taxes on the distributions.\n\nBest for: These trusts are ideal for an investor who has assets that have already grown, since assets in the trust can be sold without incurring capital gains taxes, advisers say.\n\nMistakes Often Made: Ms. Kroch advises working with a trusted professional, as the rules are very detailed.\n\nMs. McCarthy is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Indeed, what some see as a chance for average investors to participate in one of the great financial innovations of recent years could set off a trading frenzy in an already wild market.\n\n\u201cMy concern is that the launch of an ETF could lead to irrational exuberance if the price of bitcoin appreciates dramatically,\u201d says Christopher Burniske, blockchain-products lead at money manager and research firm ARK Investment Management. ARK invests in Bitcoin Investment Trust, an ETF-like fund that already trades over the counter but currently is only available to wealthy investors.\n\nWinklevosses ready\n\nAfter a nearly four-year wait, the SEC faces a deadline of March 11 to decide on a rule change that would allow the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF to trade on the Bats Global Market exchange.\n\nTwo other funds have filed similar applications that would offer ordinary investors broader access to bitcoin investing as well: Bitcoin Investment Trust, run by tech entrepreneur Barry Silbert, and SolidX Bitcoin Trust, run by SolidX Partners, are waiting for the SEC to rule on their applications to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that any of these applications will succeed. But most bitcoin observers say that a bitcoin ETF is an inevitability eventually.\n\nIf Bitcoin Investment Trust obtains SEC approval, it would likely mark Mr. Silbert as a new style of Wall Street wunderkind. Similarly, if the Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron, succeed with their ETF, they would see vindication after they were elbowed out of social-networking phenomenon Facebook.\n\nFurther, the Winklevosses stand to gain from any price increase caused by the ETF as they are among the largest individual holders of bitcoin\u2014alongside Mr. Silbert\u2019s fund.\n\nThe Winklevosses declined to comment, through a representative; Mr. Silbert said, in an email, that his lawyers had put him on \u201ctotal lockdown\u201d with the press since filing for his fund\u2019s NYSE listing.\n\nHow bitcoin works\n\nThe novel nature of bitcoin\u2014essentially a chain of numbers linked to another number on a public ledger stored in the internet cloud\u2014intrigues investors but has given the SEC pause.\n\nAndrew Odlyzko, a mathematician at the University of Minnesota, compares bitcoin to the Pacific island of Yap, where long ago the people carved giant stone currency and ferried it across the ocean in canoes. On one voyage, according to an anthropologist\u2019s work, a boulder fell off the boat. The community decided to recognize the value of the stone at the bottom of the sea, making it a virtual currency.\n\n\u201cEverybody knew it was there; nobody could see it; nobody could touch it...but it was there,\u201d Mr. Odlyzko says.\n\nOnce a bitcoin is created in a computer \u201cmining\u201d process, the community recognizes ownership of the invisible abstraction through two numbers produced in that process. One is the public key, which is like the owner\u2019s PayPal address. Anyone can send bitcoin to this address. The other is the private key, a number that is mathematically linked to the public key but is revealed only to the owner of the bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has proved useful as a low-cost way of moving money around the world. But its price is volatile. Last year alone, bitcoin closed in a daily trading range between $358 and $993, according to data provider CoinDesk.\n\nSEC\u2019s task\n\nSince the Winklevosses applied for approval of their ETF in 2013, the SEC has teased out the many, often bizarre risks of a bitcoin ETF. Among the issues: Could robots hijack more than half of the mining capacity and bring the whole system down? Could the bitcoin universe split in two as a rival cryptocurrency did? Could the fund be hacked?\n\n(Closely held SolidX, based in New York City, and the smaller entrant in the race, distinguishes itself from the other two by promising to insure its bitcoin.)\n\nSpencer Bogart, an analyst who follows bitcoin for boutique brokerage Needham & Co., says the Winklevosses have addressed security concerns\u2014planning, for example, to keep private keys locked inside offline computers, which would themselves be locked away in secure locations. Multiple individuals in multiple locations would have to grant access simultaneously to a bad actor wanting to see the keys, he says, for a theft to occur\u2014an event he considers unlikely.\n\nStill, Mr. Bogart figures the SEC could refuse approval on more pedestrian grounds: a perceived conflict of interest because the Winklevosses have kept so many important fund functions in-house.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just really difficult to grab that amount of bitcoin quickly.\u2019 \u2014Bitcoin analyst Spencer Bogart on the $300 million he says would flood into the ETF in the first week\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any ETF that trades in the U.S. where a single entity is the sponsor of the ETF, the provider of reference price for the underlying asset and the custodians of underlying asset, and that is what the Winklevosses are proposing,\u201d says Mr. Bogart, adding that the Winklevosses likely used proprietary indexes and security for reasons of design rather than personal gain.\n\nIn a November letter to the SEC, Kyle Murray, a lawyer for Bats, argued that the disclosure of the Winklevosses\u2019 multiple roles and the involvement of independent auditors and administrators mitigated any potential conflicts.\n\nThe small size of the bitcoin market, however, could still be an impediment to orderly fund trading. Across all U.S. exchanges tracked by data provider CoinDesk, the average daily volume of bitcoin traded is about $30 million. Much more trading occurs in China, but those exchanges wouldn\u2019t be used by a U.S. fund, Mr. Bogart says, because they function in an opaque manner.\n\nMr. Bogart estimates that at least $300 million would come into any approved ETF in the first week, as a convenient door to bitcoin opens up to investors. Institutional investors like pension funds haven\u2019t been able to partake in bitcoin because many of their charters require that portfolio securities are registered with authorities.\n\nMr. Burniske says it\u2019s impossible to buy $2 million of bitcoin on any given day on U.S. exchanges without moving the market.\n\nYet, for every share of the ETF sold, an \u201cauthorized participant\u201d\u2014the fund\u2019s market maker\u2014will have to buy an equivalent amount of bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe market will feel the effect of authorized participants going out there and looking to source [$300 million,] 10 times more than the daily volume that goes through any of the exchanges,\u201d says Bobby Cho, who trades bitcoin in \u201cinstitutional sizes\u201d for proprietary trading firm Cumberland Mining, a bitcoin-focused unit of Chicago-based proprietary trading firm DRW.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just really difficult to grab that amount of bitcoin quickly,\u201d says Mr. Bogart.\n\nIf the Winklevoss fund isn\u2019t approved, the closest thing to an ETF will be Bitcoin Investment Trust, which uses a private-trust structure and is managed by Grayscale Investments LLC, a unit of Digital Currency Group Inc. Only accredited investors can buy the shares on the primary private market, where they are priced in line with bitcoin. The investors must keep holdings for a lockup period of a year. Then they can sell on a secondary market, the over-the-counter OTCQX, where they currently sell at a 15% premium to the value of the underlying bitcoin, a margin that has been even wider in the past.\n\nStrong demand and perhaps a lack of sophistication are causing OTC traders to overpay for the shares, Mr. Bogart and others say. The private trust had $162 million in assets under management as of Dec. 31. This size makes its actions influential in bitcoin markets.\n\nFor his part, ARK\u2019s Mr. Burniske says he is preparing for March 11 by reading a history of financial bubbles.\n\nMr. Curran, a writer in Denton, Texas, is a regular contributor to Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.

Such payouts are often required for 401(k), 403(b) and other workplace plans as well.\n\nWhy are withdrawals required?\n\nCongress encouraged people to save for retirement by providing tax benefits for these accounts, but lawmakers don\u2019t want to shelter these savings forever. So users often must withdraw at least a minimum amount every year after age 70\u00bd.\n\nDo all retirement accounts have mandatory withdrawals after 70\u00bd?\n\nMost, but not all. Under current law, there are no required withdrawals from Roth IRAs during the owner\u2019s lifetime. Roth IRAs are different from many other tax-sheltered retirement accounts in that savers pay tax on the money they contribute. Then the assets can grow tax-free and be withdrawn tax-free.\n\nThere\u2019s also a useful exception for employees who participate in workplace plans such as 401(k)s and are still working after age 70\u00bd. If these workers don\u2019t own more than 5% of the company and their plan doesn\u2019t mandate payouts at 70\u00bd, then they needn\u2019t take required withdrawals from the plan until they retire.\n\nIn addition, if this plan accepts rollovers of the worker\u2019s other IRAs or other 401(k)s, then those assets can typically be shielded from required payouts as well, until the worker retires. Otherwise, those accounts will have required withdrawals after 70\u00bd.\n\nHow large are mandatory withdrawals?\n\nFor most people they begin at about 3.6% of assets and rise with age\u2014although they\u2019re never large enough to empty the account. The withdrawal percentage is lower for savers whose spouse is more than 10 years younger and is the sole beneficiary of the IRA.\n\nThe annual percentage applies to an individual\u2019s retirement assets as of the preceding Dec. 31. In other words, a required withdrawal for 2017 is based on assets as of Dec. 31, 2016. There\u2019s no limit on withdrawals\u2014for example, an IRA owner can pull out as much above the RMD amount as he or she wants.\n\nHow do I figure the minimum withdrawal?\n\nIRA sponsors are required to compute this amount for savers, but they can make mistakes.\n\nIf you want to double-check, the Internal Revenue Service gives tables for making the calculation in Appendix B to Publication 590-B. In essence, savers take their relevant retirement assets and divide it by a life-expectancy factor\u2014which changes slightly every year.\n\nFor example, say a 72-year-old single woman had $400,000 of IRA assets on Dec. 31, 2016. According to Table III, her factor is 25.6 years. So she divides $400,000 by 25.6 and learns that she must withdraw at least $15,625 in 2017.\n\nWhat\u2019s the deadline for taking required withdrawals?\n\nThe first payout is for the year a taxpayer turns 70\u00bd. This can be tricky, so we\u2019ll use two presidents as an example. For someone like Donald Trump who was born during first half of 1946, the first withdrawal must be taken for 2016. But for someone like Bill Clinton born in the second half of 1946, the first payout is due for 2017.\n\nFor most years, the deadline for taking the mandatory withdrawal is Dec. 31. But there\u2019s a grace period for the first payout, and the deadline is April 1 of the following year. Thus, someone born in the first half of 1946 must take the first payout by April 1, 2017, but for someone born in the last half of 1946, the initial deadline is April 1, 2018.\n\nCaveat: Savers who postpone their first withdrawal until the April 1 deadline risk triggering a higher tax bracket, because they will have two payouts in the same year.\n\nWhat\u2019s the tax rate on withdrawals?\n\nThe withdrawal becomes part of the saver\u2019s ordinary income and is taxed at those rates, not lower long-term capital-gains rates.\n\nIf the saver has after-tax money in a traditional IRA, then a portion of the required annual payout is not taxable. Figuring this portion can be troublesome and requires good records.\n\nI have several IRAs and a 401(k) plan with required withdrawals. Must the payout for each account come from that account?\n\nThis issue causes much confusion. Each payout from a 401(k) plan must be figured separately and taken from that account.\n\nWith IRAs, however, the saver is free to take the required payout disproportionately. So he or she can take a large amount from one IRA, a little from another and nothing from others, as long as payments add up to the correct total. A good reason to take uneven payouts might be that one account has more cash than another, or the owner wants to drain a smaller IRA and close it.\n\nBut be sure to avoid another common mistake in this area, which is when one spouse takes the entire required payout for both spouses if each has IRAs. Instead, each partner must take such payouts from his or her own accounts.\n\nMust I take withdrawals in cash?\n\nNo, it\u2019s possible to take them \u201cin kind\u201d\u2014that is, as stock shares or even a piece of real estate. For an IRA owner who doesn\u2019t plan to spend the money, this move could help avoid commissions for selling and then repurchasing an investment. But it can be complicated, so allow extra time and find out if the sponsor charges fees.\n\nThe new \u201ccost basis\u201d in the asset, which is the starting point for measuring taxable gain, is the value on the date of the payout.\n\nHow should I time withdrawals?\n\nThis is a matter of individual choice. Some savers opt for periodic payments similar to a pension. Others take a lump sum late in the year to delay owing taxes. Retirees often owe quarterly estimated taxes, so consider whether to have taxes withheld.\n\nIf a saver dies without having taken the required payout for the year, there can be complications for the person or people who inherit the IRAs. There\u2019s still a required withdrawal, but it goes on the heir\u2019s tax return.\n\nIf I take more than the minimum payout one year, can I apply the excess to my minimum payout the next year?\n\nNo.\n\nRequired withdrawals are showering me with taxable income I don\u2019t need. Are there ways to lower them?\n\nYes, within limits. Still-working employees older than 70\u00bd may be able to forgo payouts until they retire (see discussion above).\n\nIn addition, charitably minded savers often benefit by using IRA assets to make their donations (see related article).\n\nIRA owners can also exclude up to $125,000 of assets from the base for computing required payouts if they use the assets to buy \u201cqualifying longevity annuity contracts,\u201d or QLACs. These are IRS-approved deferred annuities that don\u2019t pay out until the owner reaches age 85, and they help make sure savers won\u2019t outlive their assets.\n\nFor most years, the deadline for taking the mandatory withdrawal is Dec. 31, but there\u2019s a grace period for the first payout. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nFinally, the IRA owner can convert IRA assets above the required annual payout to a Roth IRA, which doesn\u2019t require withdrawals during the owner\u2019s lifetime under current law.\n\nThe catch here is the cost: Assets converted to a Roth IRA are taxable, and doing a conversion can push the taxpayer into higher brackets. Whether the move is worth it depends on individual circumstances.\n\nMany people who convert assets to Roth IRAs do so in increments over several years in order minimize the tax bill. Often a good time to do such conversions is in the years leading up to age 70\u00bd. If the IRA owner has retired and is in a lower tax bracket, the cost of Roth conversions will often be lower as well.\n\nWhat if I miss a withdrawal or take less than the required amount?\n\nThe penalty is 50% of the amount not withdrawn. That\u2019s stiff, but there\u2019s often a remedy, says Mr. Slott. Just withdraw the shortfall right away, file Form 5329 with the IRS, and attach a short statement explaining why. You don\u2019t need to pay the penalty to do this.\n\nOften the IRS will forgive the penalty, he says, and filing the form also starts the clock running for the statute of limitations. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this work in virtually every case,\u201d he says.\n\nMs. Saunders is a Wall Street Journal special writer in New York.

Photo: Jan Larsen Art\n\nStreet art is finding its way off of the sides of buildings\u2014and onto collectors\u2019 walls.\n\nThe medium\u2014which, as the name implies, is usually situated in public spaces and is often infused with a political or social theme\u2014has been grabbing a lot of attention among mainstream art aficionados in recent years. In part, that\u2019s thanks to the growing popularity of Banksy, the nom de guerre of a U.K.-based graffiti artist, filmmaker and painter. But there are also bigger factors at play, including an increased focus on social and economic matters in the broader culture.\n\nArt experts say the movement is truly global. Luigi Mauri is curator of an exhibition of 55 street artists from 30 countries at the MdM Museum in Porto Cervo, along the northern coast of Sardinia. He says world-wide names in the movement include JR and Invader (France), OsGemeos (Brazil), Blu (Italy), Jos\u00e9 Parl\u00e1, Swoon, Faile and Shepard Fairey (the U.S.), Evol (Germany) and DALeast (China).\n\nA piece of the action\n\nTypically, the rise of a new artistic genre would create opportunities for collectors and investors. Street art, however, creates some obvious challenges.\n\nIt is difficult, albeit not impossible, to collect art that is stenciled or painted to a public wall or sidewalk. Still, art experts say, the act of relocating a piece of street art can change its meaning and value.\n\n\u201cI am not a big fan of moving street art to galleries because the context of the art is so important,\u201d says Cristina Salmastrelli, director of Affordable Art Fair New York, which is part of the global Affordable Art Fairs brand.\n\nCollectors who go that route must understand how the change in context will affect the work itself\u2014for example, a work of protest stenciled onto the wall of a bank might lose its power when relocated to a gallery. Buyers should be careful to work with a gallery that understands the medium, she says.\n\nOthers think that public art shouldn\u2019t be moved at all. If someone wants a large piece of street art to display at their private home or office, Mr. Mauri says, they should hire a street artist to create it for that site, rather than take an existing piece out of its intended location. \u201cWe don\u2019t take street art pieces out of walls,\u201d says Mr. Mauri. \u201cI think gallerists removing street art pieces from the streets should be prosecuted.\u201d\n\nMurals in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District inspired the Mission School art movement. Photo: Wendy Connett/Corbis\n\nThat being said, there are other ways for collectors to participate in street art. The term is broad enough to include the work of street artists created for settings such as galleries, homes or offices. The themes, techniques and motifs\u2014such as the use of stylized text or political messages\u2014can still be employed in more portable media such as paintings or drawings on canvas or wood. Mr. Mauri refers to such street art as urban contemporary art.\n\nChris Johanson, for one, is an artist who has been associated with the Mission School, which takes inspiration from the murals and graffiti on the streets of the Mission District in San Francisco. While some of his work was made on the street itself, it also has included paintings and installations done in a street style.\n\nThe art of collage\n\nJosh Goldstein, an artist and architect, moved to New York from Indiana in 1994, and started to photograph traditional bodega signs, cutting the photos into pieces, which in turn were used to make collages. The link between the collages and the street is very strong\u2014they are constructed using street images, and are meant to convey the essence of the street itself.\n\n\u201cInstead of each photograph being a work in itself, they were like samples, that I wove together, to create this other New York that was New York but more New York,\u201d says Mr. Goldstein, who maintains a website, bodeganyc.com.\n\nThat early work led to a chance to be in a group show in Harlem, \u201cFrom Motown to Def Jam,\u201d which reflected the close relationship between street art and music. That led to commercial work on a billboard in Times Square. Later, during the financial boom, hedge-fund investors paid as much as $10,000 for his work.\n\nMore recently, his collages have employed other elements of New York street life, such as a holiday greeting card that features snippets of food signs set against the local skyline.\n\nHow much should collectors expect to pay for street art?\n\nFor big-name artists, \u201cyou need at least $1 million to start a decent collection,\u201d says Jean-Marc Scialom, founder of the Nukod Gallery in Paris, which focuses on street art. \u201cIf a street-art collector doesn\u2019t have this money, he can start with just $99 for a nice print.\u201d\n\nMr. Scialom advises new collectors to check the number of prints in a series\u2014in general, the fewer the better\u2014and see if they are signed by the artist. He also urges collectors to look into the artist\u2019s biography. That can often include indications of quality and potential, such as how many exhibitions the artist has had and whether the artist is represented by a gallery.\n\nCollectors looking for short-term investments should focus on small pieces by newer artists, whose work often doubles in two or three years. But Mr. Scialom \u201cwon\u2019t encourage this type of attitude,\u201d because it could be wrong for artists looking to build long-term relationships with collectors.\n\nMr. Rosenbush is editor of CIO Journal.

At that point, however, it may be too late to keep inherited assets such as vacation homes, rare collections and other gifts away from a former partner, even if those assets were never intended to go to that person.\n\nWhat is considered separate versus marital property can vary, depending on the state in which a couples lives. So-called kitchen-sink states such as Vermont, Michigan, Massachusetts and Connecticut, for example, don\u2019t typically distinguish between separate and marital property.\n\n\u201cYou may be able to walk away with that ring your grandmother gave you, but the value of the asset will be considered in the division of property,\u201d says Lori Lustberg, a Shelburne, Vt.-based lawyer and certified divorce financial analyst.\n\nWhile the financial outcome of a divorce may boil down to where you live, there are things you can do to help sway the outcome, especially when it comes to inheritances, experts say. Here is a look at a few strategies:\n\nNegotiate a Prenup\n\nWhile not always airtight, prenuptial and postnuptial agreements can help shield assets such as an inherited business, money, property or a rare art collection should a couple end up in divorce court. Depending on state law, a prenup or postnup can state that in the event of a divorce, each spouse will forgo his or her rights to any inheritance or major gift given to the other partner before or during the marriage.\n\nWhile many perceive contractual agreements to be unromantic, they \u201cwork as intended,\u201d says David Reischer, an attorney and chief operations officer at LegalAdvice.com, who signed a prenup with his wife to protect his inherited stamp collection.\n\nCouples may be getting more savvy about protecting what is rightfully theirs, according to attorneys. In 2013, 63% of members surveyed by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers reported seeing an increase in prenuptial agreements during the previous three years.\n\nBilly Bauer of Manhattan plans to go that route. He says he wants to marry his girlfriend one day\u2014but only if she signs a prenup.\n\nThe 22-year-old\u2019s biggest concern is protecting the future equity and voting stakes in his family\u2019s 40-year-old business, Royce Leather, which he says generates more than $4.5 million in annual revenue and which he anticipates inheriting, along with his brother, after their parents pass away.\n\n\u201cI have to be as pragmatic as possible,\u201d says Mr. Bauer.\n\nSave Documentation\n\nPeople should keep any paperwork that shows an inheritance was intended only for one partner.\n\n\u201cOne of the arguments we see in Minnesota is if there is a gift received during marriage then the person who wants it back has to show it was a gift to them alone,\u201d says Michael Boulette, a family-law attorney and adjunct professor in Minneapolis.\n\nA copy of someone\u2019s gift-tax return is especially useful for this purpose, as it includes a section where the donor can specify who the individual beneficiary was and how much that beneficiary was given. A letter from the donor that explains for whom the funds were intended or even a wedding card addressed to just one person also may help, some experts say.\n\n\u201cEvery state is different [but] the more you have to show, the better your claim,\u201d says Lisa C. Decker, a certified divorce financial analyst and chief executive of the Atlanta-based consultancy Divorce Money Matters. \u201cIf you do get anything in writing, put it in a safe place\u2014with your attorney, your financial adviser, a relative or in a safe-deposit box. Nobody wants to think in 20 to 30 years they\u2019ll need this stuff but it can happen,\u201d she says.\n\nMaintain Separate Accounts\n\nCouples shouldn\u2019t commingle inherited money or other assets in an account that also includes the other spouse\u2019s funds. Instead, they should put it in a separate bank or investment account.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s separate then you avoid arguments unless it was gifted to the other spouse, as well,\u201d says Mr. Boulette.\n\nMs. Decker says she has a divorce case where the husband and wife say they each received separate inheritances during their marriage, but that they put the funds in the same account and lost any paperwork about who was given what. In all likelihood, she says, they are going to have to split the money 50/50.\n\nOf course, if a beneficiary spends an inheritance while married, in most cases it will be considered gone. \u201cYou don\u2019t get reimbursed on divorce because you spent a gift from your grandparents on a wonderful vacation or to pay down debt,\u201d Mr. Boulette says.\n\nRely on Trusts\n\nRussell Redenbaugh, the San Francisco-based founder of Kairos Capital Advisors, says if he were to ever give a home to one of his children as a wedding present he would likely do it via a trust, which would include certain provisions to stop any assets from going to his child\u2019s ex in the event of divorce. \u201cThat would prevent it from becoming marital property,\u201d says Mr. Redenbaugh, who has already used trusts to protect other assets for his children.\n\nA trust can be as broad or specific as someone wants, says Catherine Seeber, a senior financial adviser at Wescott Financial Advisory Group. In addition to property, trusts can be used to pass down a financial inheritance.\n\nA trust is usually slightly more expensive than just gifting money, Mr. Redenbaugh says, and it may involve paying a fee to a person or firm to oversee it. But, he says, a simple trust document can be drafted in less than an hour.\n\nKeep Titles in One Name\n\nIn the absence of a prenuptial agreement, the best way to protect separately owned property such as a vacation home bought and paid for before a marriage is to avoid adding a partner\u2019s name to the deed, experts say.\n\nThey recommend using the same strategy if a spouse receives a financial inheritance specifically to buy a second home or investment property during a marriage.\n\nKeep in mind that the way in which the property is used can change its classification in community-property states such as Arizona, California, Nevada, Washington and Texas. For example, if an inheritance is spent on a home that supports both spouses, it becomes marital property and may be used when negotiating equitable financial settlements, says Ms. Seeber.\n\nRefinancing a mortgage and adding a spouse\u2019s name to the deed at that time, or completing major renovations with funds that were jointly earned by a couple, could jeopardize full ownership of a home, experts warn. \u201cAll of that can cause house claims to fluctuate,\u201d says Mr. Boulette. As such, the titled owner should cover all renovation and refinancing cost and save documentation that proves it.\n\nSimilarly, if a gifted vehicle holds considerable value, as some vintage models do, the beneficiary should make sure only his or her name is on the registration and that they, not a spouse, are the primary driver.\n\nMr. Parmar is writer in Toronto.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-money-buy-happiness-heres-what-science-has-to-say-1415569538", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "New research is suggesting that happiness is determined not by how much money one earns, but rather, how one spends it. University of British Columbia associate professor Elizabeth Dunn explains why. Photo: Getty.\n\nIt\u2019s an age-old question: Can money buy happiness?\n\nOver the past few years, new research has given us a much deeper understanding of the relationship between what we earn and how we feel. Economists have been scrutinizing the links between income and happiness across nations, and psychologists have probed individuals to find out what really makes us tick when it comes to cash.\n\nThe results, at first glance, may seem a bit obvious: Yes, people with higher incomes are, broadly speaking, happier than those who struggle to get by.\n\nBut dig a little deeper into the findings, and they get a lot more surprising\u2014and a lot more useful.\n\nIn short, this latest research suggests, wealth alone doesn\u2019t provide any guarantee of a good life. What matters a lot more than a big income is how people spend it. For instance, giving money away makes people a lot happier than lavishing it on themselves. And when they do spend money on themselves, people are a lot happier when they use it for experiences like travel than for material goods.\n\nWith that in mind, here\u2019s what the latest research says about how people can make smarter use of their dollars and maximize their happiness.\n\nExperiences Are Worth More Than You Think\n\nRyan Howell was bothered by a conundrum. Numerous studies conducted over the past 10 years have shown that life experiences give us more lasting pleasure than material things, and yet people still often deny themselves experiences and prioritize buying material goods.\n\nSo, Prof. Howell, associate professor of psychology at San Francisco State University, decided to look at what\u2019s going on. In a study published earlier this year, he found that people think material purchases offer better value for the money because experiences are fleeting, and material goods last longer. So, although they\u2019ll occasionally splurge on a big vacation or concert tickets, when they\u2019re in more money-conscious mode, they stick to material goods.\n\nBut in fact, Prof. Howell found that when people looked back at their purchases, they realized that experiences actually provided better value.\n\n\u201cWhat we find is that there\u2019s this huge misforecast,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople think that experiences are only going to provide temporary happiness, but they actually provide both more happiness and more lasting value.\u201d And yet we still keep on buying material things, he says, because they\u2019re tangible and we think we can keep on using them.\n\nCornell University psychology professor Thomas Gilovich has reached similar conclusions. \u201cPeople often make a rational calculation: I have a limited amount of money, and I can either go there, or I can have this,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I go there, it\u2019ll be great, but it\u2019ll be done in no time. If I buy this thing, at least I\u2019ll always have it. That is factually true, but not psychologically true. We adapt to our material goods.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s this process of \u201chedonic adaptation\u201d that makes it so hard to buy happiness through material purchases. The new dress or the fancy car provides a brief thrill, but we soon come to take it for granted.\n\nExperiences, on the other hand, tend to meet more of our underlying psychological needs, says Prof. Gilovich. They\u2019re often shared with other people, giving us a greater sense of connection, and they form a bigger part of our sense of identity. If you\u2019ve climbed in the Himalayas, that\u2019s something you\u2019ll always remember and talk about, long after all your favorite gadgets have gone to the landfill.\n\nAnd, crucially, we tend not to compare our experiences with other people so much. \u201cKeeping up with the Joneses is much more prominent for material things than for experiential things,\u201d he says. \u201cImagine you\u2019ve just bought a new computer that you really like, and I show up and say I\u2019ve paid the same amount for one with a brighter monitor and faster processor. How much would that bug you?\u201d\n\nDan Tague\n\nIn experiments he\u2019s run, it bugs people a lot. But when people are told to imagine they\u2019ve gone on vacation to New Zealand, and someone else has had a slightly better vacation, \u201cit bothers people somewhat, but you still have your own experiences and your own memories, and so it tends to trouble you less.\u201d\n\nIn a recent paper called \u201cWaiting for Merlot,\u201d Prof. Gilovich and colleagues showed that we also get more pleasure out of anticipating experiences than anticipating the acquisition of material things. People waiting for an event were generally excited, whereas waiting for material things \u201cseemed to have an impatient quality.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t Adapt to What You Buy\n\nOne of the main reasons why having more stuff doesn\u2019t always make us happy is that we adapt to it. \u201cHuman beings are remarkably good at getting used to changes in their lives, especially positive changes,\u201d says Sonja Lyubomirsky, psychology professor at the University of California, Riverside. \u201cIf you have a rise in income, it gives you a boost, but then your aspirations rise too. Maybe you buy a bigger home in a new neighborhood, and so your neighbors are richer, and you start wanting even more. You\u2019ve stepped on the hedonic treadmill. Trying to prevent that or slow it down is really a challenge.\u201d\n\nOne approach that can work, she says, is consciously trying to foster appreciation and gratitude for what you have. The process of adaptation, after all, comes from taking what you have for granted, so you can slow it down by reminding yourself of why you value what you have.\n\nIt could be as simple as setting aside time every day to follow the traditional advice of \u201ccounting your blessings.\u201d Or you might want to keep a daily journal or express your gratitude to other people. The key is to find a way to remain conscious of everything you own and avoid simply adapting to having it around.\n\nBecause you\u2019re working against your natural inclination, Prof. Lyubomirsky acknowledges that feelings of gratitude and appreciation can be very difficult to sustain. If your journal or daily list becomes just a stale routine, it will no longer have much effect. You might have to keep switching techniques.\n\nIncreasing variety, novelty or surprise can also help you to enjoy your possessions more. \u201cWhen things become unchanging, that\u2019s when you adapt to them,\u201d Prof. Lyubomirsky says.\n\nIf you keep a painting hanging in the same spot on the same wall, for example, you\u2019ll stop noticing it after a while. But swap it with a painting from another room, and you\u2019ll see each of them with fresh eyes, and appreciate them more. Try sharing your possessions with other people, too, and opening yourself up to new experiences, she says.\n\nThis could even mean depriving yourself of your possessions for a while, perhaps by lending them or sharing them with someone else. Elizabeth Dunn, associate professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia and co-author of the book \u201cHappy Money,\u201d recently conducted an experiment where she sent people home with a big bag of chocolate, telling some of them to eat as much of it as they could and others that they were forbidden to eat it. A third group could choose how much to eat.\n\nThe result? The people who had been forbidden from eating chocolate were able to enjoy their next chocolate bar much more than those who\u2019d either eaten a lot or consumed their normal amount. \u201cGiving something up temporarily can actually help to preserve our capacity to enjoy it,\u201d Prof. Dunn says.\n\nTry Giving It Away\n\nThe paradox of money is that although earning more of it tends to enhance our well-being, we become happier by giving it away than by spending it on ourselves.\n\nThat\u2019s the finding from a series of studies by Prof. Dunn. She began by handing out cash to students on campus and telling some to spend it on themselves and others to spend it on someone else. Those who spent money on other people were happier than those who treated themselves.\n\nProf. Dunn has since repeated the experiment in other countries across the world, and has extended it to look at whether people were still happy when giving away their own money rather than free money handed to them by a professor. She found that in countries as diverse as Canada, South Africa and Uganda, giving away money consistently made people happier. This was even true when people were giving away their own money, and even when they themselves were relatively poor.\n\nShe also worked with economists to analyze survey data from 100 countries in the Gallup World Poll, and found that people who donated money to charity were happier, in poor and rich countries alike.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we were able to observe the same effect that we\u2019d seen in Canada in places like South Africa and Uganda was probably the biggest surprise of my career,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of us think we\u2019ll give to charity one day, when we\u2019re richer, but actually we see the benefits of giving even among people who are struggling to meet their own basic needs.\u201d\n\nWhat moves the needle in terms of happiness is not so much the dollar amount you give, Prof. Dunn says, but the perceived impact of your donation. If you can see your money making a difference in other people\u2019s lives, it will make you happy even if the amount you gave was quite small.\n\nBe Sure to Buy Time, Too\n\nIt\u2019s also important to consider how what you\u2019re buying will affect how you spend your time. That big house in the suburbs may seem like a good idea, but a 2004 study by Alois Stutzer and Bruno Frey of the University of Zurich found that people with longer commutes reported lower overall life satisfaction, all other things being equal. They calculated that you would need a 40% raise to offset the added misery of a one-hour commute.\n\nDan Tague\n\n\u201cUse money to buy yourself better time,\u201d says Prof. Dunn. \u201cDon\u2019t buy a slightly fancier car so that you have heated seats during your two-hour commute. Buy a place close to work, so that you can use that final hour of daylight to kick a ball around in the park with your kids.\u201d\n\nAnother way to buy yourself time, Prof. Dunn says, is by outsourcing tasks you dislike. Whereas hiring personal assistants used to be the preserve of the wealthy, it\u2019s now easier and more affordable to hire freelancers and virtual assistants online to help you with either regular administration or just individual tasks.\n\nShe\u2019s currently doing research on how people actually spend the time they save by outsourcing tasks and whether it makes them happier. The preliminary findings, she says, are that most people do become happier by buying time for themselves, but only if they use the time in the right way.\n\n\u201cOur hypothesis is that people will be much more likely to derive an emotional benefit if they think of it as \u2018windfall time\u2019 and use it to do something good, rather than just taking it for granted,\u201d she says.\n\nBut while buying time is a good idea, putting a dollar value on your time may not be. In another piece of research in progress, Prof. Dunn is finding that when people think of their time as money, it makes them less likely to spend even small amounts of time on things that are not financially compensated. \u201cSeeing time as money may have a number of destructive consequences,\u201d she says.\n\nMoney Only Brings Happiness Up to a Point\n\nWhen looking at all of these research results, there\u2019s an important caveat to bear in mind. Those in the field divide happiness into two components, and you need to have both parts working together to be truly happy. But only one of those components keeps improving the more you earn. The other tops out after a certain point.\n\nThe first measure of happiness is \u201cevaluative.\u201d Prof. Lyubomirsky defines it as \u201ca sense that your life is good\u2014you\u2019re satisfied with your life, you\u2019re progressing towards your life goals.\u201d That\u2019s the measure used by economists Justin Wolfers and Betsey Stevenson, who have conducted extensive research comparing economic data and happiness surveys across the world. \u201cWe found very clear evidence that in just about every country around the world, rich people are happier than poor people,\u201d says Prof. Wolfers. \u201cAnd people in rich countries are happier than people in poor countries.\u201d\n\nThe other component of happiness\u2014\u201caffective\u201d\u2014looks at how often you experience positive emotions like joy, affection and tranquility, as opposed to negative ones, explains Prof. Lyubomirsky. \u201cYou could be satisfied with your life overall but you may not actually be happy at the time,\u201d she says. \u201cOf course, happy people experience negative emotions, just not as often. So you have to have both components.\u201d\n\nDaniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton of Princeton University found that when they looked at affective measures, happiness did not rise after a household reached an annual income of approximately $75,000. (They did, however, find a consistent rise in overall life satisfaction, matching the results of Profs. Wolfers and Stevenson.)\n\nThe bottom line: When you don\u2019t have much money, a little extra can go a long way, because you have more essential needs to fulfill. As you accumulate more wealth, however, it becomes more difficult to keep \u201cbuying\u201d more happiness.\n\nDon\u2019t Get in Over Your Head\n\nFinally, although much of the research in this field is on spending money rather than saving it, the researchers agree that spending more than you can afford is a route to misery. Taking care of your basic needs and achieving a level of financial security is important.\n\nProf. Gilovich says that although his research shows that life experiences give more happiness than material goods, people should of course buy the essentials first. His findings hold true across a broad range of income levels and demographic groups, but not for people with very low incomes. \u201cThose people don\u2019t really have discretionary income; it pretty much all has to go on necessities,\u201d he says.\n\nSome studies, meanwhile, have shown that debt has a detrimental effect on happiness, while savings and financial security tend to boost it. A survey of British households found that those with higher levels of debt reported lower happiness, and a separate piece of research on married couples showed that those in more debt had more marital conflict.\n\n\u201cSavings are good for happiness; debt is bad for happiness. But debt is more potently bad than savings are good,\u201d Prof. Dunn says. \u201cFrom a happiness perspective, it\u2019s more important to get rid of debt than to build savings.\u201d\n\nSo before you go out and spend all your money on a dream vacation, make sure you\u2019ve taken care of the basics, paid off your debts, and have enough money to shield yourself from the worst of life\u2019s troubles.\n\n\u201cFinancial advisers are actually right,\u201d Prof. Howell says. \u201cThe first thing you should be doing with your money is building up a safety net. If you go into debt to buy these great life experiences, the stress you\u2019ll feel when the credit-card bill comes in will probably wipe out the good that you got from the experience.\u201d\n\nMr. Blackman is a writer in Crete.

But realistically, how much income is the likely cutoff?\n\nThere is no firm cutoff, but unless you can pay the full tuition cost out of pocket for every child you have in college, you ought to file the federal financial-aid form known as Fafsa, says education-savings expert Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Cappex.com.\n\nAsk Us a Question Have a question about college finance in general? We\u2019ll be answering them in future funds reports. Send them to reports@wsj.com.\n\nExcept for the wealthiest families, most college-goers will qualify for some kind of aid, especially if a family has more than one child in college, because of the way the formulas are calculated, Mr. Kantrowitz says. They\u2019re dependent on income, and to a lesser extent on assets, but also on the number of college students in a household. You can qualify for more aid either by having a lower expected family contribution (which gauges how much your family can afford to pay), or by attending a school with a higher cost of attendance. That\u2019s why expensive private colleges sometimes give financial aid to families whose incomes you might think would be too high, he says. \u201cAt some of the most selective colleges with \u2018no loans\u2019 financial-aid policies, even families with income up to $180,000 can qualify for institutional grants,\u201d he says.\n\nA family with one child enrolled at an in-state public college, with household income over $350,000 a year and assets of more than $1 million (aside from retirement accounts and the family home), shouldn\u2019t bother filing the Fafsa unless they want to take out loans, he says. But if you make less than that, have fewer assets, have a student at a more expensive school or have more than one child in college, you should fill out the form.\n\n***\n\nMy grandson has graduated from college with student loans. If he cashes in savings bonds to repay the loans, would that be considered an education expense for which savings-bond interest isn\u2019t taxable?\n\nYou can\u2019t use this money in a tax-free manner to pay off student loans. \u201cThe exemption for excluding savings-bond interest is for qualified education expenses, which the payback of loans isn't,\u201d says Robert Schmansky, a certified financial planner with Clear Financial Advisors in Livonia, Mich. What\u2019s more, he says, the bondholder must have been 24 years old before the bond\u2019s issue date.\n\nOne potential bright spot: Student-loan interest can be reported as a tax deduction on your tax return. \u201cThis has the potential to lower your tax liability,\u201d says Bob Meighan, a vice president at Intuit\u2019s TurboTax unit.\n\n***\n\nIs it possible to set up a Upromise 529 account for future grandchildren not yet born? In that way, the account could benefit from my purchases without me having to put any personal money in until I have grandchildren.\n\nUpromise, a product offered by Sallie Mae, incorporates both your contributions and loyalty bonuses based on your purchases from participating shopping partners to fund either a regular savings account or a 529 account, Mr. Meighan says. However, you\u2019ll need a living beneficiary\u2014not a future grandchild\u2014before you can establish a 529. \u201cWhile you cannot set up a 529 for anyone not currently alive, you can set up a 529 for yourself as the beneficiary and make a change of beneficiary at some point in the future,\u201d Mr. Schmansky says.\n\n***\n\nMy children are three years apart, so they will overlap at college for one year. I have a 529 for my older child. In the year they overlap, can I use that account to pay senior-year tuition for the older one, then retitle the beneficiary to the younger one and pay freshman-year tuition?\n\n\u201cOne of the great benefits of 529 plans is that they allow you to change the beneficiary to another family member without tax consequences,\u201d Mr. Meighan says. In this case, you can change the plan\u2019s beneficiary to your younger child once you pay the older student\u2019s tuition. This can happen in the same year. Just be careful that you make the payment for each child while that child is named as the beneficiary on the account, as one 529 account cannot serve two beneficiaries at the same time.\n\n\u201cIt can be a wise move with multiple children to see if there may be any \u2018leftovers\u2019 for an older child before fully funding [529s] for your younger children,\u201d says Mr. Schmansky. He tells clients that it isn\u2019t always smart to max out your children\u2019s 529 plans, even if you plan to pay for four years of undergraduate education. You can\u2019t tell the future: Your children may receive a scholarship, or may not complete college.\n\n***\n\nAre 529 withdrawals equal to the amount of a merit scholarship considered taxable income?\n\nIf you take money out of a 529 up to the amount of a scholarship the student has received, you won\u2019t have to pay the 10% penalty on that withdrawal, as you would for nonqualified expenditures. But you\u2019ll have to pay ordinary income tax on any amount you withdraw that represents a gain, Mr. Meighan says.\n\nHere\u2019s an example he cites: If you contributed $20,000 to a 529 plan that is now worth $22,250, and the beneficiary received a $25,000 scholarship, you can withdraw up to $22,500 penalty-free. However, $20,000 is a tax-free distribution of your contribution, and the $2,250 gain is taxed at your regular income-tax rates.\n\n\u201cIf you have a scholarship paying for a part of your expenses, you simply would want to use your 529 plan for other eligible expenses,\u201d Mr. Schmansky says.\n\n***\n\nI have a New York state 529 college-savings plan for my daughter, who is now attending school in Michigan. Should I transfer the money to a Michigan plan first and then to the school, or pay the school directly from the New York plan?\n\nPREVIOUS COLLEGE Q&A COLUMNS\n\nLeave your money in the New York plan, and pay it directly from there, says Mr. Schmansky. The federal tax deferral isn\u2019t dependent on the state where you hold the account or the state where your student goes to school. But \u201dthe tax benefits you received as a New York taxpayer may be lost if you transfer your plan,\u201d he says. For example, some states require account holders who transfer funds to another state\u2019s plan to pay back past deductions, as well as state income taxes on the earnings with the plan, he says.\n\nIn general, don\u2019t move 529 money around from account to account other than to pay college expenses, says Mr. Meighan. \u201cPaying the education expenses directly from the plan mitigates potential questions later about what the money was spent on.\u201d\n\n***\n\nWe are longtime retirees in our 80s. Can we use one of our existing IRAs to fund a 529 for our new grandson?\n\nYes. Since you\u2019re older than 59\u00bd years old, you won\u2019t pay a penalty on the distribution, but you\u2019ll still have to pay taxes on the withdrawal, Mr. Meighan says. What\u2019s left after paying income taxes can be contributed to your grandson\u2019s 529 account, where it will grow tax-free. You may also get a state tax deduction when you move the money into the 529, depending on where you live.\n\n\u201cDepending on your personal circumstances, this still may be a smart move if those who would inherit the IRA otherwise would pay at a higher rate than you would,\u201d says Mr. Schmansky. Or consider converting your regular IRA into a Roth IRA that you pass down to future generations, he says: \u201cAn inherited Roth IRA will be tax-free to the recipient, can be used for any purpose, and won\u2019t have the investment restrictions of a 529 plan.\u201d\n\nCheck with your tax adviser to make sure you\u2019ve thought through the estate-planning implications of such a move.\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

What can they offer? And what\u2019s the best way to make sure everyone works together?\n\nHere is a closer look at three main professional groups and the roles they play in helping manage an aging parent\u2019s finances, as well as how best to streamline and coordinate among these groups.\n\nFinancial Professionals\n\nOnce adult children get a handle on the types of accounts a parent has, they can turn to the different financial professionals who work with those accounts\u2014keeping in mind that the parent is the client.\n\nIt\u2019s typical for a parent to have a banker who handles checking and savings accounts, money-market accounts and certificates of deposit, and a financial adviser who manages a portfolio of investments, brokerage accounts and retirement accounts, says Carly Howard, a wealth strategist in Atlanta for Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management.\n\nThe financial adviser is likely to also handle financial planning, including cash-flow analyses and retirement planning, she says.\n\nThere might be other financial specialists in the picture, such as a certified public accountant, insurance agent or mortgage specialist. Ms. Howard suggests coordinating those conversations through the financial adviser.\n\nIt also could help to gather everyone for a yearly meeting, with the financial adviser acting as a sort of quarterback for the team. \u201cGet everyone, including the financial team, the parent and child, in the same room and have a good dialogue,\u201d says Denis Higgins, a certified financial planner and CPA at Edelstein & Co. in Boston. This way, everyone is on the same page, he says.\n\nLegal Professionals\n\nAnother professional likely to be included in that meeting is an estate-planning attorney who can assist on crafting a last will and testament, or help with more complex estate planning including trusts.\n\nIf a parent isn\u2019t already working with an estate-planning attorney, ask the financial adviser for a reference, and consider accompanying the parent to a meeting with a prospective lawyer, says David Geibel, a wealth adviser at Girard Partners Ltd. in King of Prussia, Pa.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s daunting to talk to an attorney, especially about things that are uncomfortable, so being there and being supportive\u201d can be helpful, he says.\n\nAtlantic Trust\u2019s Ms. Howard recommends letting the parent direct the conversation. To avoid the appearance of undue influence from the child, the parent should have a private, one-on-one discussion with the attorney as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that parents communicate with family members what their intentions are for the estate plan,\u201d says Ms. Howard.\n\nMedical Professionals\n\nIt can be a little harder to integrate medical professionals into the discussion, in particular because of privacy concerns.\n\nBut one critical situation where it will be important to coordinate between a parent\u2019s doctor and lawyer is in situations of diminished capacity.\n\nIdeally, durable powers of attorney for medical care and finances\u2014which would allow a person of the parent\u2019s choosing to act in his or her place in the event of mental incapacity\u2014are sorted out well before a parent has reached this stage. But in cases where no action has been taken to secure proper legal documentation, a doctor will generally need to vouch that the parent is incapacitated or unable to make his or her own decisions, says Ms. Howard.\n\nAs for working with professionals while an aging parent is still competent, it can be a good idea to keep mom or dad\u2019s financial adviser abreast of any major medical developments that have a direct bearing on financial issues\u2014provided the parent approves\u2014so that the adviser can plan accordingly.\n\nAdult children should consider accompanying their parent to the doctor\u2019s office for appointments, or attending via conference call if they don\u2019t live in the same city, says Carol Harrington, a partner and head of the Private Client Group at law firm McDermott Will & Emery LLP in Chicago.\n\nThis way, the child stays informed and can ask questions\u2014something an elderly parent may be less inclined to do, says Ms. Harrington.\n\nMs. Prior is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

(Owners of traditional IRAs have to start taking distributions from their accounts after age 70\u00bd, or face a tax penalty.)\n\nFor charitably minded IRA owners, this is often a highly tax-efficient move. While there\u2019s no deduction for such donations, neither are they part of the donor\u2019s adjusted gross income, or AGI. And AGI is a trigger for several important tax provisions. Minimizing AGI can help lower or avoid the 3.8% surtax on net investment income, payments for Medicare premiums and even taxes on Social Security payments.\n\nDoing a charitable transfer also enables some savers to forgo filing Schedule A and claim the \u201cstandard\u201d deduction, reducing paperwork and possibly lowering taxes.\n\nDetails matter with these transfers. For example, the benefit is available only for donations of IRA assets, not 401(k) assets, and the donation must bypass the owner and go directly from the IRA sponsor to the charity. Charitable transfers also aren\u2019t valid until an IRA owner actually turns 70\u00bd.\n\nIn addition, IRA sponsors don\u2019t have to include IRA donations on the 1099-R tax form, so donors must remember them when gathering tax documents.\n\nFinally, donors who have highly appreciated investments held longer than a year in a taxable account may reap more benefits by donating them instead of IRA assets, so it\u2019s important to evaluate alternate strategies.\n\nMs. Saunders is a Wall Street Journal special writer in New York.

Illustration: Lloyd Miller for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe stock market in January has no special ability to forecast the future.\n\nThat may surprise a lot of investors, since a popular urban myth on Wall Street is that the market\u2019s performance in January predicts which direction stock prices will take for the full year. The problem is that there is little statistical support for that belief.\n\nAccording to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, this supposed pattern\u2014variously known as the January Indicator or the January Barometer\u2014was devised by the legendary market guru Yale Hirsch in 1972.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to look very far to find the shortcomings of the January Barometer. You may recall that January 2016 was one of the worst Januarys for the stock market in U.S. history, with the S&P 500 index sliding more than 5%. An investor guided by the January Barometer would have gotten out of stocks in early February, at what turned out to be some of the worst prices of the entire year\u2014and missed the more than 15% rally the market mounted from early February through the end of the year.\n\nIn fact, the January Barometer has been right only 64% of the time since 1972. For a sense of how faulty that is, consider this: If there was a rule that simply predicted the market would go up every year, it would have been right 76% of the time over the same period.\n\nSome January Barometer devotees nevertheless insist that its record is better than these statistics suggest. For example, Jeffrey Hirsch, Yale Hirsch\u2019s son and editor of the Almanac Investor newsletter, reports that the Barometer has an 86.4% accuracy rate since 1950. But I believe that success rate is inflated, for a couple of reasons.\n\nThe first is that, when calculating it, Mr. Hirsch\u2019s approach is to ignore those years in which the indicator\u2019s failures were supposedly minor\u2014\u201cflat years\u201d in which the market moved less than 5% in the opposite direction to that which was forecast. (Including those eight 5%-or-less years immediately shaves 12 percentage points off the Barometer\u2019s performance.) The second factor inflating the Barometer\u2019s reported success rate is including in that record\u2019s calculations the years before its discovery in 1972.\n\nPodcast\n\nBoth of these statistical no-nos are symptoms of an all-too-common practice known as data mining\u2014slicing and dicing the data until they produce the desired conclusion.\n\nThe younger Mr. Hirsch nevertheless stands by the January Barometer, insisting that its record is \u201cextraordinary.\u201d In an interview, he argued that the indicator\u2019s record has been particularly impressive during years in which the market rose in January. In such years since 1972, it has been right 85% of the time\u2014better than the 76% success rate since then of a rule predicting the market would always rise.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear that even this improvement in success rate from 76% to 85% is statistically significant, however. That\u2019s because of another, less obvious, form of data mining, according to Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business.\n\nIn an interview, Prof. Harvey explained that before the January Barometer was \u201cdiscovered,\u201d many other hypotheses undoubtedly were explored by myriad market observers who over the years have combed through stock-market history in search of apparent seasonal patterns.\n\nWith each additional hypothesis that is explored, Prof. Harvey argues, it becomes more likely that one of them will appear to have a phenomenal record but in fact be worthless going forward. To compensate for this increased likelihood of error, he adds, it\u2019s important to employ increasingly stringent standards of statistical significance with each additional hypothesis that is tested.\n\nJanuary Barometer devotees stand by the indicator\u2019s accuracy. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nTo be sure, this type of data mining isn\u2019t unique to the January Barometer. On the contrary, Prof. Harvey\u2014president of the American Finance Association, an organization of finance academics\u2014said in his presidential address to the association last week in Chicago that this problem affects much of academic finance research as well. Many of the supposed patterns on which some market timers and traders base their strategies would be found to be no more than statistical flukes if their track records were properly adjusted for the data mining involved in their discoveries, Prof. Harvey said.\n\nThe best advice for most individual investors, therefore, is to buy and hold a diversified group of quality stocks\u2014without regard to whether the stock market is up or down this month.

Photo: Chris Crisman\n\nSmall-cap value funds ruled the roost for most of 2016, and they dominated the list of the best actively managed stock funds for the year in The Wall Street Journal Winners\u2019 Circle contest.\n\nThe contest is a quarterly look at the best trailing 12-month performances for actively managed stock funds.\n\nAegis Value Fund (AVFAX) handily won the competition for the second quarter in a row, with a 12-month return of 70.7%. Numerous other small-cap value funds also scored 30%-plus gains for the 12 months.\n\nThe contest is limited to diversified U.S.-stock funds with at least $50 million in assets and a track record of more than three years. Index funds and exchange-traded funds don\u2019t qualify, because they aren\u2019t actively managed; leveraged funds also are disqualified.\n\nJust as it did in the previous quarterly contest, the deep-value approach to small stocks taken by the Aegis fund\u2019s manager, Scott Barbee \u2014buying stocks at especially low valuations\u2014has propelled it to the top of the heap.\n\nWhile Mr. Barbee lagged behind his peers in the fourth quarter itself, when the fund eked out a relatively modest gain of 6.8% while small stocks as a group soared more than twice as much, he dominated for the 12 months as his stake in energy and mining stocks gave him an insurmountable lead over the pack earlier in the year.\n\n\u201cWe had bought a lot of our gold-mining holdings when they were at very low valuations, and then liquidated them midway through last year after the market got excited and those valuations became very high,\u201d Mr. Barbee says.

Illustration: James Yang for The Wall Street Journal\n\nCan small stocks build on their recent outsize gains, or was 2016 an anomaly?\n\nThat\u2019s a particularly crucial question for those who watched the small-stock rally unfold on the sidelines and now wonder anxiously whether it\u2019s too late to get a bit of the action.\n\nHere\u2019s how strong last year\u2019s rally was: As 2016 drew to a close, Chip Reed, a portfolio manager at Atlanta Capital Management in Atlanta, was preparing to head off to a client meeting to apologize for posting a total return of only 19% for the year. That may sound absurd, after a year in which the S&P 500 index rose 9.5% and provided a total return, including dividends, of 12%.\n\nBut Mr. Reed manages portfolios of smaller and midcap stocks, and suddenly, those are the kinds that are dominating the market. A small-stock fund manager isn\u2019t in a position to crow, relatively speaking, even with a 20% gain for the year. \u201cMoney was just flying into these stocks, especially into the [small-cap] banks,\u201d Mr. Reed says.\n\nWhat happened? After what Mr. Reed calls \u201cthe worst start of any year\u201d that he can recall\u2014with the Russell 2000 small-stock index stuck in a bear market in early February, down 26% from its high in 2015\u2014small stocks regained their footing by midyear, playing catch-up as the profit picture began to improve for some companies and investors began to look more favorably on mining and energy stocks of all sizes following signs of strength in commodity prices.\n\nThen small stocks exploded the day after the presidential election, in part due to bets that smaller companies\u2014which skew toward domestic rather than international business\u2014would benefit more than others from President-elect Donald Trump \u2019s policies. With a gain of 11% in November alone, the Russell 2000 ended the year with a 19.5% advance and a total return of 21.3%.\n\nSome analysts think this is more than just a postelection bounce for small stocks (generally defined as those with market values below $2 billion). They point to encouraging trends in corporate profits and those expectations for friendly government policies. But others advise caution, mainly because of the heights reached by valuations in the rally, and emphasize that investors who want into the market need to be selective.\n\nSmall-stock funds in lead\n\nInvestors in small-stock mutual funds had plenty to celebrate last year, with some reaping gains well beyond the Russell index\u2019s stellar advance. According to data from Thomson Reuters Lipper, while large-cap funds posted average returns ranging from 1.8% (for growth funds) to 14.6% (for value funds), small-cap value funds, in particular, easily beat all of the other nonspecialist stock-fund categories, recording an average return of 26.8%.\n\nThe list of top-performing U.S.-stock managers in 2016, as measured by The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Winners\u2019 Circle contest, was dominated by small-stock skippers. The managers of Aegis Value Fund (AVFAX), a small-stock value fund, blew away the field with a 70.7% total return for the year to win the contest, followed by several other small-stock fund managers with 30%-plus gains. (More here on the contest and the winning manager, Scott Barbee of Aegis.)\n\nChasing this kind of outperforming asset class is tricky, however, even if the rally does continue. It\u2019s possible that more gains lie in store, says Dan Suzuki, senior U.S. equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. But the market already has priced in a lot of good news, he adds, and valuations are high. \u201cYou want to be more cautious than usual; the bull case for small stocks is very much based on sentiment,\u201d he says.\n\nFor those who want to join the party, it\u2019s important not to just grab anything with a small-cap name and hope to replicate the overall performance of the small-cap sector, Mr. Suzuki says. Only 45% of small-cap funds were beating their benchmark as of the beginning of December, he says.\n\nAnd investors need to be sure of exactly what they\u2019re buying, Mr. Suzuki says. Many small-stock fund managers own a smaller percentage of the stocks in their benchmark than a large-cap manager would of S&P 500 stocks, he says, leaving more room for their funds to stray from the benchmark\u2019s performance. And some fund portfolios may include midcap stocks.\n\nWhat could go wrong\n\nThere are a number of possible headwinds for small stocks, chief among them the fact that Federal Reserve policy makers have resumed raising interest rates precisely as small-stock valuations have moved into nosebleed territory.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a raging debate within my group about whether the optimism has gone too far,\u201d says David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Global Asset Management, who says he is among those who are cautious, especially in the wake of the postelection rally. \u201cLast year you had the long-term asset-allocation argument in your favor\u2014that these stocks outperform over the long run\u2014and you had valuation in your favor.\u201d Today, he says, the magnitude of the rally has weakened those arguments for new investment in small stocks, though these shares still give an investor diversification.\n\n\u2018We see an earnings-driven market that we think will continue into 2017.\u2019 \u2014Lisa Kirschner, director of research at Richard Bernstein\n\nA year ago, few investors would have been prepared to bet that such a dramatic outperformance was on the cards. The Russell had been a laggard for years. Some analysts, however, had been anticipating a recovery because of an upswing in small companies\u2019 profits, and some see corporate earnings continuing to support the market.\n\n\u201cThe profits recession is ending, and we began seeing some incremental improvement in December\u201d of 2015, says Lisa Kirschner, director of research for Richard Bernstein & Associates.\n\nAmong all stock groups, Ms. Kirschner says, smaller stocks had the biggest improvement in earnings growth, on a year-over-year basis, between the second and third quarters of 2016, and that puts the rally on a solid footing.\n\n\u201cWe see an earnings-driven market that we think will continue into 2017,\u201d she adds. \u201cThese are quite positive indicators, even though at some point, these companies will run into a tug of war\u201d between higher interest rates and rising profits.\n\nMs. Kirschner sees potential for the small-stock rally to broaden.\n\nSo far, she says, it has been driven by the most cyclical parts of the market, as those companies\u2019 profits come off a cyclical bottom. That\u2019s why it\u2019s the small-cap value funds that are leading the way, rather than small-cap growth funds, which as a group returned 10.1% in 2016. But she expects more companies to report earnings growth.\n\n\u201cValue is a typical outperformer,\u201d she says. \u201cThese cyclical components tend to outperform first and fastest, then others play catch-up.\u201d\n\nTrump factor\n\nWhatever the near-term profit outlook, much of the impetus behind the spectacular rally in smaller stocks since Mr. Trump\u2019s election has to do with expectations for the longer-term impact of the president-elect\u2019s policies on this group.\n\nFinancial stocks are the biggest sector in the Russell 2000 index, and the many smaller banks in the Russell have soared. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThose investors who have piled into small stocks since Election Day are making a straightforward bet. Mr. Trump\u2019s platform has a protectionist tilt, and small stocks tend to have a domestic focus. Logically, they should thrive, at least on a relative basis, in an anti-free-trade environment.\n\nAnd since smaller companies struggle to benefit from the tax-reduction strategies that their larger counterparts can use readily, Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to cut the corporate tax rate also should boost small-cap profits.\n\nMeanwhile, financial stocks are the biggest sector in the Russell 2000, and the many smaller banks in the Russell have soared as investors react to promises to cut financial regulations.\n\nOverall, argues Mr. Lafferty, the market environment remains positive, \u201cbut you have to have to those earnings materialize, because the high valuations are hanging over this market now. You\u2019ve already generated a lot of the performance you\u2019re going to get\u201d without additional gains in earnings.\n\nMs. McGee is a writer in New England.

If one person\u2019s retirement plan leans toward a certain type of investment, the other\u2019s might balance it, say experts. Photo: Stockphoto/Getty Images\n\nHave you looked at your 401(k) lately? Many are convinced the best thing to do with a retirement plan is not to fiddle with it. It\u2019s good to ignore short-term volatility and focus on long-term goals. But you shouldn\u2019t ignore your account entirely.\n\n\u201cCheck it annually,\u201d says Kimberly Foss, founder of Empyrion Wealth Management Inc. in Roseville, Calif., and New York. \u201cA lot of people set it and forget it. That\u2019s a big deterrent to really creating wealth for an individual over time,\u201d Ms. Foss says, noting that she helps clients manage their 401(k)s like any other asset.\n\nHere are five to-do items to keep your 401(k) on track in 2017:\n\n1. Check the fees\n\nThe more you pay in fees, the less money you have working for you. For example, an investor bulletin from the Securities and Exchange Commission notes that $100,000 in a mutual fund that earns a 4% annual return over 20 years and has a continuing 0.25% fee will grow to $208,413. Raise that fee to 1% and you end up with $179,213. That\u2019s a fee bite of about $29,000.\n\nPlus, studies by mutual-fund researcher Morningstar Inc. find that expenses \u201care strong predictors of performance.\u201d That is, cheaper is often better. Look at the expense ratio for each of your investments. Anything charging 1% or more deserves close inspection, especially given that many mutual funds charge a fraction of that for common offerings, such as S&P 500 index funds.\n\nIf your employer \u201cauto-enrolled\u201d you into the 401(k), your money likely is going into a target-date fund, which essentially promises to manage your money until your estimated year of retirement. That might be the right choice for you, but note that you\u2019re likely paying extra for that convenience.\n\n2. Consider new choices\n\nYour 401(k) may have improved since last time you looked, so research any new products being offered. For example, 54% of large and midsize employers that offer 401(k)s now offer a Roth 401(k), according to a 2014 study by consulting firm Willis Towers Watson. Roth 401(k)s let you contribute after-tax money that then grows tax-free. (With a traditional 401(k), you contribute pretax money and then pay taxes on the money when it is withdrawn from the plan.)\n\nOne advantage of these products is tax diversification in retirement, says Marina Edwards, Chicago-based senior retirement consultant with Willis Towers Watson. Given that the money pulled out of traditional 401(k)s and IRAs is taxable, \u201cit might be very advantageous to have a bucket of money available to us that doesn\u2019t have any tax liabilities tied to it,\u201d she says. Having access to a tax-free account can make it easier to manage taxes in retirement.\n\nIf you\u2019re near retirement, see whether your employer offers \u201clifetime income\u201d tools. With 401(k)s, generally a person saves a lump sum that he or she then needs to create income from in retirement. Knowing how much to safely take out each month\u2014over a lifetime of uncertain length\u2014is a problem that lifetime income tools can help solve.\n\nSome employers offer access to annuity marketplaces directly from 401(k) online platforms, Ms. Edwards says. Other employers let retirees keep the money in the plan and receive monthly checks, for a fee, until the money runs out.\n\n3. Check your asset allocation\n\nYou should check your account at least once a year to make sure market gyrations haven\u2019t caused you to be overly invested in stocks or bonds. In other words, rebalance, if needed. But it is also important to consider your own situation, says Thomas Batterman, a fiduciary adviser with Financial Fiduciaries, a money manager in Wausau, Wis.\n\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019ve encountered a health issue, so you\u2019re going to be retiring earlier than you had planned,\u201d he says. That suggests moving to more conservative investments. \u201cOr maybe you received an inheritance\u2014you can afford to take a little more risk with your tax-deferred assets because you have a bigger safety net,\u201d he says.\n\nIf you\u2019re a 401(k) saver who hasn\u2019t considered asset allocation (that is, deciding what percentage of your money to invest in different types of investments), it is time to start. One rule of thumb says \u201c100 minus your age\u201d is the percentage of your investments that should be in stocks; the rest goes to bonds. If you can\u2019t do the research, consider a target-date fund. You\u2019ll pay a fee for the convenience, but the fund sets your asset allocations.\n\n4. Review the whole picture\n\nConsider your 401(k) in the context of all of your invested money. You don\u2019t want \u201cmatching retirement accounts and taxable accounts,\u201d says Maura Griffin, principal of Blue Spark Capital Advisors in New York. Instead, she says, consider the tax advantages of your investments when deciding which account to use. For example, corporate bonds are taxed at ordinary income-tax rates. \u201cYou\u2019d have to pay that tax on an annual basis in your taxable account, whereas that would all grow tax-deferred in your retirement account,\u201d she says. Meanwhile, tax-free municipal bonds make more sense in a taxable account.\n\nInclude your spouse\u2019s accounts in your planning. \u201cIf your 401(k) has a lot of baseball, apple pie and Chevrolet stuffing it, then maybe the investments in your Roth IRA or your spouse\u2019s 401(k) [should be] international or small-cap stocks\u201d for diversification, says Larry Rosenthal, president of Rosenthal Wealth Management Group in Manassas, Va.\n\nIf you need to make changes, be wary of tax implications and transaction fees.\n\n5. Save more\n\nDid you increase your contribution rate this year? \u201cOne of the secrets to wealth accumulation is the acquisition of shares,\u201d Mr. Rosenthal says. \u201cThe more shares you get, the better time is going to reward you as the markets rise over time.\u201d\n\nSays Ms. Griffin: \u201cIf you\u2019ve gotten a raise, put that raise in there. You\u2019ll never notice it.\u201d\n\nThe best savings rate for you depends on your circumstances, but an oft-cited retirement-savings goal is to save at least 15% of income.\n\nMs. Coombes is a writer in San Francisco.

Former WSJ Indexes Editor John Prestbo dives into the Dow's reaction to past elections to gauge future market performance on Lunch Break With Tanya Rivero. Photo: Bettmann Archives\n\nFinally, we decide.\n\nAnd then, thank goodness, this presidential campaign will be over. But for investors, who always are looking ahead, the postelection guesswork is just beginning.\n\nDo presidential elections, investors want to know, offer any investment angle?\n\nThe answer is yes. There are plenty of caveats, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average does show definite patterns over the past 120 years that are worth heeding.\n\nThe main one is that the stock market tends to be buoyant preceding presidential elections but usually performs weaker afterward. In the 12-month periods leading up to 30 presidential Election Days beginning in 1900 (and including this election period, through Monday), the Dow industrials have climbed 24 times. The median performance\u2014the exact middle of the range of returns\u2014for those 30 years is a gain of 9.0%.\n\nBut in the one-year periods following the elections, the median gain is less than half as much, 4.4%. The Dow has risen six fewer times, and the two biggest gains, of about 50% each, were way back after the 1924 and 1932 elections featuring winners Calvin Coolidge and Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\n(Statistics often demand footnotes. The 1896 election was omitted in computing the average market performance before elections because the Dow was launched only five months before the vote. But it was counted in measuring the after-election moves. Conversely, the year leading up to this election is counted, but obviously the postelection performance is to come.)\n\nSkeptics might point out that history is an unreliable guide because it doesn\u2019t repeat exactly. Granted, but history is about all we have to leaven our guesses.\n\nIn line with history\n\nThis year the market fits the first part of the historical precedent. The industrial average has climbed 1.6% since Nov. 6, 2015, through Monday. (Still, that is only because of Monday\u2019s rally; before that, the Dow had been virtually unchanged for the 12 months.)\n\nThere certainly is a sharp contrast between this year\u2019s candidates, but that isn\u2019t new. My first presidential vote was in 1964, Lyndon Johnson vs. Barry Goldwater, and those two were political opposites. (I voted for Johnson, though my father physically resembled Goldwater so much that people stopped him on the street.)\n\nThe median performance for the Dow in the 12 months before presidential elections is 9.0%. But for the same period that follows elections, it drops to 4.4%. Illustration: Brian Stauffer for The Wall Street Journal\n\nFor the record, the industrial average leapt 16.2% in the year leading up to that election, which Johnson won handily. It rose only 9.9% in the year afterward, a period marked by growing U.S. involvement in, and opposition to, the Vietnam War.\n\nThe pattern holds for tight races, as well. George W. Bush and Al Gore finished Election Day 2000 in a near tie. Vote recounting in Florida dragged on for more than a month until the U.S. Supreme Court put a stop to it. The Dow had risen 2.3% in the 12 months before the election but sank 12.5% over the next 12, which included the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nDuring the period when the result was in limbo, the industrial average bounced erratically in a 600-point range, responding to each new headline about the recount. Wall Street pundits duly considered the relationship between anointing a new president and the course of the market.\n\nI monitored this discussion with great interest from my perch as \u201ckeeper of the Dow,\u201d the staff person then in charge of details about Dow Jones\u2019s crown jewel of market measures (now part of S&P Dow Jones Indices).\n\nNothing definitive emerged from this discussion, however. On one hand, the president has great influence over national economic policy and other important things that directly affect investors\u2019 willingness to pour money into the stock market. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that market moves reflect anticipation of and reflection upon the country\u2019s new chief executive\u2014a behavior along the lines of \u201cbuy the rumor\u201d (the scheduled but as yet unresolved election event) \u201cand sell the news\u201d (the event\u2019s outcome, which recedes into history fast as life moves on).\n\nOn the other hand, a jillion factors foreign and domestic, not to mention personal and transcendent, continuously shape investors\u2019 judgments. With such a deluge it is seldom possible to identify a single cause for a specific market move. And that includes electing the president.\n\nAn Abreast of the Market column in The Wall Street Journal on Nov. 13, 2000, six days after that non-Election Day, summed it up this way: \u201cThe stock market finds itself at the mercy of the election drama being beamed from Palm Beach. While that\u2019s not the only reason stocks are weak, the controversy has magnified problems, such as disappointing earnings news, that were already there.\u201d\n\nWhat next?\n\nAs for what happens in the 12 months after Election Day, at first blush it doesn\u2019t seem to make a tremendous difference who wins, at least as far as market performance. Democrats prevailed 14 times in the past 30 elections, and in the one-year periods after those Election Days the median performance of the Dow was a rise of 6.9%. Republicans won 16 times, posting a median 4.1% advance one year later.\n\nHow about when the election puts the opposing party into the White House? In six elections when a Republican candidate won while a Democrat was in power, the Dow\u2019s median performance over the subsequent 12-month periods was a 9.0% drop. In the reverse situation, not applicable this year, the median for six postelection years was an advance of 7.7%.\n\nAnd if the election extends a party\u2019s lease on the White House, other differences in historical consequences ensue.\n\nIn 10 elections when Republicans maintained their hold\u2014again, not pertinent this year\u2014the Dow\u2019s median performance over the following year was a 9.5% advance. When Democrats kept the front-door key in eight elections, the median was a 5.6% gain.\n\nAnother footnote is needed, however. All of those Democratic lease renewals were the re-elections of sitting presidents.\n\nSince that situation is out of the question this time around, it is possible that the year ahead could deviate from the historical pattern. Time will tell.\n\nMr. Prestbo, a former Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Indexes editor, is an adviser to MarketGrader Capital, which chooses components of the Barron\u2019s 400 Index.

A new study adds to a growing body of research that suggests it is\u2014at least when it comes to your health.\n\nThe research, recently published in the Journal of Economic Psychology, found that donating to charity may actually improve a giver\u2019s physical and emotional well being. The study also suggested a link between increases in charitable tax subsidies, which have been found to spur giving, and improvements in people\u2019s perceptions of their own health. (Perception of health tends to be a good indicator of future health-care use and mortality rates.)\n\nThe Wall Street Journal spoke with the paper\u2019s author, Baris K. Y\u00f6r\u00fck, an associate professor of economics at the University at Albany-SUNY, about his findings. Here are edited excerpts:\n\nSubsidies and Health\n\nWSJ: What did you set out to examine in this paper?\n\nMR. Y\u00d6R\u00dcK: Studies in the economic and public-policy literature show that tax subsidies for charitable giving are quite effective in increasing personal donations. Studies in the medical literature find that giving to others reduces stress and strengthens the immune system. My study combines these ideas.\n\nMy hypothesis: If giving to others is better for health and if tax subsidies significantly increase charitable giving, then increasing tax subsidies may positively effect health.\n\nWSJ: What did you find?\n\nMR. Y\u00d6R\u00dcK: After I control for variables like income, family size, gender, employment status, race, educational attainment and marital status, I find the probability of reporting better health goes up as the tax subsidy for charitable giving increases.\n\nThe main variable I am interested in is a self-reported health index taken from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, [a data set complied by the University of Michigan]. Survey respondents report their general health on a scale from one to five. Five is excellent health and one is poor.\n\nA 1% increase in a tax subsidy for charitable giving is associated with a 0.1% increase in the health index. The effect is statistically significant, though very moderate. To go up one notch in the health index, say from three to four, implies an almost 200% increase in the tax subsidy, which is basically impossible.\n\nI also find a positive relationship between charitable giving and self-reported health status. As the amount of the donation increases, health status improves.\n\nCosts vs. Benefits\n\nWSJ: The paper suggests tax subsidies might reduce the probability of suffering from certain diseases and psychological disorders. Can you elaborate?\n\nMR. Y\u00d6R\u00dcK: Tax subsidies have a statistically significant impact on lung disease, arthritis and emotional disorders. This supports the main findings, but interpreting [each] individually is quite difficult. Emotional problems make sense because the medical literature also finds a positive effect of charitable giving on psychological well being, but the positive impact on arthritis or lung disease is less clear.\n\nThe paper also shows that tax subsidies have a positive effect on high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, heart attack and obesity, but the magnitude of these effects is small and not statistically significant.\n\nWSJ: What are the paper\u2019s policy implications?\n\nMR. Y\u00d6R\u00dcK: My findings imply that further expansions in tax subsidies for charitable giving would positively affect the health status of individuals in the U.S., but more research is needed. I don\u2019t provide a cost-benefit analysis in this paper. We could calculate the foregone tax revenue that comes with a 1% increase in tax subsidies and the economic benefit of a 0.1% increase in society\u2019s health status and then compare those two numbers.\n\nWSJ: The paper says the federal government forwent about $47 billion in revenue due to charitable deductions in 2012. How likely is it that the health benefits could outweigh the cost?\n\nMR. Y\u00d6R\u00dcK: You never know. It\u2019s possible.\n\nMs. Ward is a writer in Mendham, N.J.

Photo: Getty.\n\nThe complexity and questions that arise from the nation\u2019s ever-changing tax laws are as certain as taxes themselves. So we introduce a new column, written by Tom Herman, a former tax columnist for The Wall Street Journal, that will look at developments affecting taxpayers and individual investors. We welcome your thoughts and questions about tax issues, big and small. Send them to reports@wsj.com.\n\nEarly birds, be careful.\n\nBefore firing off your 2014 income tax return, take some time to master a few important, but easily overlooked, deductions, credits and other breaks\u2014including a few that were revived at the end of last year.\n\nEven if you consider yourself a tax wizard who loves studying the Internal Revenue Code, it\u2019s increasingly easy to make costly bloopers. Also, watch out for a few new wrinkles this year, notably those stemming from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHere are some areas that deserve extra attention:\n\nHEALTH INSURANCE Get ready for some new lines on this year\u2019s forms because of the Affordable Care Act. For most, this should be fairly simple. \u201cThe majority of taxpayers\u2014more than three out of four\u2014will simply need to check a box to verify they have health-insurance coverage,\u201d the IRS says. Others will face trickier issues. Some may be eligible to claim an exemption from the coverage requirement. But those who don\u2019t have qualifying coverage or who don\u2019t qualify for an exemption will need to make \u201can individual shared responsibility payment.\u201d Others may qualify for a \u201cpremium tax credit.\u201d See irs.gov/aca for details. For some \u201cthis will be very complicated,\u201d warns Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting U.S.\n\nSOCIAL SECURITY TAX Some people who worked for two or more employers last year may have paid too much in Social Security tax. The maximum amount that should have been withheld by all your employers for 2014 was $7,254. (That\u2019s 6.2% of $117,000, the maximum amount of wages subject to the Social Security tax.) If you had too much withheld, you typically can claim the excess as a credit. See IRS Publication 17 for details.\n\nINVESTMENT LOSERS Did you lose money on stocks, bonds and other investments you sold last year? Use your capital losses to offset capital gains. But what if your losses exceeded your gains? You can deduct as much as $3,000 a year ($1,500 for married taxpayers filing separately) of net losses against your wages and other ordinary income. Carry over excess losses into future years. Warning: You can\u2019t deduct a loss on the sale of your personal residence.\n\nIRA CHARITABLE TRANSFERS Late last year, lawmakers revived a provision that allowed many people age 70\u00bd or older to transfer as much as $100,000 directly from an IRA to charity, tax-free, during 2014. The transfer counted toward the taxpayer\u2019s required minimum distribution. You\u2019re supposed to report your \u201cqualified charitable distribution\u201d on your return even if it\u2019s tax-free. Just make sure you don\u2019t put it on the wrong line. For example, if you file Form 1040, report your \u201cQCD\u201d on Line 15a. Don\u2019t include any of that distribution on the line for \u201ctaxable amount\u201d (Line 15b). Instead, write \u201cQCD\u201d next to the line.\n\nHIGHER STANDARD About two out of every three returns typically claim the standard deduction. For 2014, the basic standard deduction is $12,400 for those married and filing jointly, or $6,200 if single or married and filing separately. There are additional amounts for people who were 65 or older, or blind. Before taking the standard deduction, check to see if you might be better off itemizing.\n\nSALES TAXES Late last year, Congress revived a law that gives taxpayers who itemize an important choice: They can deduct either state and local income taxes paid in 2014\u2014or their state and local sales taxes. (But they can\u2019t deduct both.) The sales-tax option offers welcome relief for people in states with no income tax, such as Texas and Florida. But taxpayers in other states may benefit from taking the sales-tax deduction, says Mr. Luscombe, including those who paid large amounts of sales tax on major purchases such as cars or boats or those who reside in states with high sales-tax rates.\n\nHOME OFFICE Many people who work at home don\u2019t bother deducting their home-office expenses because the rules can be fiendishly complex and because of fears it would increase their chances of getting audited. But if you qualify to deduct home-office expenses, you may benefit from a simplified calculation method allowed by the IRS. Multiply the square footage of the home used for your home office (but not more than 300 square feet) by an IRS-approved rate of $5 a square foot. Thus, the maximum deduction in this case would be $1,500.\n\nMr. Herman is a writer in New York City. He was formerly The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Tax Report columnist.

Harvard Business School's Shawn Cole discusses with WSJ's Tanya Rivero. Photo: Getty\n\nIt\u2019s time to rethink how we teach children about money.\n\nFor all the effort parents put into helping their children understand dollars and cents, and for all the effort schools put into formal lessons in personal finance, most children still grow up into adults who can\u2019t properly save, spend and budget.\n\nNow researchers\u2014from psychologists to economists to communications experts\u2014have started asking why. And the one theme that comes out of their research loud and clear is that we\u2019re doing it all wrong.\n\nWe focus on teaching finance in school when regular math is much more effective at helping children manage money. We cram their heads full of financial facts and strategies years before they\u2019ll actually need any of it\u2014ensuring that they won\u2019t remember the lessons when they\u2019re most needed. And we squirm about discussing our own family income and debt, giving children fears and false impressions they may never shake off.\n\nHere are some of the biggest findings from the research\u2014and advice from educators and researchers\u2014about how we can do better.\n\nFocus on Teaching Math\u2014Not Money\n\nPerhaps the most startling finding is that classroom education in finance often doesn\u2019t translate into real-world results.\n\nFor decades, studies have extolled the benefits of financial education, pointing out that students who take finance classes score well on tests of financial knowledge\u2014and higher financial literacy leads to better financial behavior.\n\nConclusions like these have led to a growing consensus that schools should teach children about managing their finances, with 43 states now mandating some kind of training.\n\nShawn Cole found this troubling. Not because the studies aren\u2019t true: Many, he says, do show a correlation between financial education and good financial behavior. But few studies demonstrated a strong causal link.\n\nIllustration: Stephen Webster\n\nSo, the professor of finance at Harvard Business School wondered, if widespread financial education were really effective, why are so many young people struggling with debt, foreclosure and low asset accumulation? He and a group of researchers set out to find an answer. They looked at the states that mandated personal-finance curriculums in high school, and compared the financial health of students who graduated before the mandates to those who graduated after. Their hypothesis: If personal-finance education worked, the students who graduated after the programs were implemented would be better off financially.\n\nThey weren\u2019t. After controlling for state, age, race, time and sex, and analyzing a huge pool of historical financial data, the group found that there was no statistically significant difference between people who graduated within a 15-year span either before or after the personal-finance programs were implemented. Graduates\u2019 asset accumulation and credit management were the same, with or without mandated financial education.\n\n\u201cI teach finance for a living, so I want to believe that financial education works,\u201d says Mr. Cole. \u201cBut, really, across every data set we looked at, across every population segment, we just couldn\u2019t find any effect of financial education on behavior.\u201d\n\nWhy? Many studies that show a correlation between financial literacy and real-world financial success try to control for other factors that might influence behavior, but it is very hard to make causal inferences from correlational data, says Mr. Cole. For instance, the income bracket of parents may have a big effect on children\u2019s performance on financial-knowledge tests, much more so than a class they take.\n\nBut the study, issued last year and currently under revision for publication, did find one school subject that does have an impact on students\u2019 financial outcomes: math. Students required by states to take additional math courses practiced better credit management than other students, had a greater percentage of investment income as part of their total income, reported $3,000 higher home equity and were better able to avoid both home foreclosure and credit-card delinquency.\n\n\u201cA lot of decisions in finance are just easier if you\u2019re more comfortable with numbers and making numeric comparisons,\u201d says Mr. Cole.\n\nWithout strong math skills, he says, people tend to use more emotional ways to invest, spend or save their money. What\u2019s more, people with less math experience make worse financial mistakes with issues like compounding or underestimating how quickly interest accumulates.\n\nHe says the math courses don\u2019t need to be complicated, but should teach about concepts that come up a lot with money, such as exponential growth, which come in handy when thinking about compounding.\n\nA parent of two, Mr. Cole says he will be making sure his children take as much math as they can. He recommends other parents do the same.\n\nTell the Whole Story, Warts and All\n\nThere\u2019s a consensus that financial education should begin at home. But the way many parents cover the topic at the kitchen table needs a serious upgrade. \u201cEven now, parents talk more about sex with their children than they do about money,\u201d says Lynsey Romo, an assistant professor of communication at North Carolina State University who studies family information sharing.\n\nIn a 2014 study of 136 children aged 8 to 17, she found that while children reported their parents shared information on general topics like saving, spending and earning, children said their parents tended to stay mum on sensitive topics like the family\u2019s specific income and family debt.\n\nOften, parents fear causing their children anxiety or think talking about money is impolite. The problem is, keeping these secrets often caused more anxiety than telling the truth.\n\nChildren with wealthy parents, for instance, sometimes assumed their parents didn\u2019t talk about how much money they made because they were poor\u2014but the real reason was that the parents didn\u2019t want the children to brag.\n\nAnd the negative effects of that childhood anxiety can last into adulthood. In other research, Ms. Romo found that subjects who report limited communication with their parents about money later in life feel \u201cclueless,\u201d as if they don\u2019t truly understand how credit cards or money management works.\n\nInstead of concealing sensitive topics, Ms. Romo recommends using financial discussions, no matter how sensitive, as \u201cteachable moments.\u201d\n\nTrips to the store are good moments to have these conversations, says Anita Vangelisti, a professor of communication at the University of Texas at Austin. Parents might explain why buying one item makes more sense from an economic perspective than another, comparing quality, price, benefits and the family\u2019s general budget.\n\nDon\u2019t Make Money Scary\n\nA group of Polish researchers came to similar conclusions about why people should speak frankly about money. Children, the researchers say, are quick to pick up on the symbolic value of money\u2014all of the emotions it can stir and the associations it carries\u2014even if they don\u2019t understand how cash works. If parents don\u2019t speak frankly about money, the researchers say, those associations pile up and lead children to act selfishly in the short term, and in the long term leave them with illusions about the power of money.\n\nIn their study, published in the Journal of Economic Psychology, the academics found that children who were focusing on money acted much more selfishly toward their peers. The researchers randomly divided 120 children aged between five and six into four groups. One group counted coins, one counted notes and the others various other objects. After doing so, the children were asked to help pick purple crayons out of a box of mixed-color crayons. The children who counted coins and notes were less willing to help with the task than those that had counted paper and buttons.\n\nSo, parents must be careful to avoid giving money too much psychological weight, says Tomasz Zaleskiewicz, one of the study\u2019s authors, a psychology professor at the University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Wroclaw, Poland. The best way to do that is to speak about money in a rational way.\n\nOver time, children who don\u2019t get straight answers tend to think about money in purely symbolic terms, giving it more emotional weight than it deserves, he says. They may end up looking at the world through costs and benefits, rather than social rules of reciprocity. This can limit the ability to develop close relationships that would help people cope with problems in a way money cannot.\n\nFurther, if children continuously come to associate money with power, they might begin to see it as a solution to many problems, he says. They might come to see it as a way to cope with fears, attract new friends or increase their well being.\n\nTeach Them \u2018Just in Time\u2019\n\nAnother mistake parents make with financial education is trying to get it done in one go. They enroll children in summer camps or one-semester classes that aim to cover everything from running lemonade stands to applying for a mortgage.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that financial knowledge decays over time, says John Lynch, director of the Center for Research on Consumer Financial Decision Making at the University of Colorado, Boulder.\n\nIn a meta-analysis of over 200 studies that was published in Management Science last year, Mr. Lynch and two other professors found how swiftly the effects of one-time financial instruction wear off. About half of the studies were about the effects of financial education\u2019s impacts on behavior. Their analysis found that the impact of one hour of financial instruction wore off after about five months. Eighteen hours wore off after around 17 months. And 24 hours disappeared after about 20 months.\n\n\u201cSo, if you expect that a course taught to children will stick with them into adulthood, you are fooling yourself unless you do something very different from what has been studied so far,\u201d says Mr. Lynch.\n\nThe professor believes his findings lend support to an increasingly popular strategy among financial educators and policy makers called \u201cjust in time\u201d education. Instead of teaching all elements of personal finance at once, \u201cjust in time\u201d education gives consumers the knowledge they need just as they are about to engage in a transaction. So, instead of giving information about car loans to students in a textbook, consumers would get the information as they started shopping for cars.\n\nParents can adopt this technique, too.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you want to teach your child about budgeting, and you know that every year, Aunt Ethel writes your child a $50 check for Christmas,\u201d says Mr. Lynch. \u201cThe moment to talk about budgeting is just before that happens. If you have that conversation a few months before or a few months after, it\u2019s not going to have an effect.\u201d\n\nMr. Wells is a news editor for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

But money continued to flow to bond funds. Photo: JB Reed/Bloomberg News\n\nThe stock market remains near record highs, and bonds are up, too\u2014an uncommon combination. But there isn\u2019t too much celebration as investors navigate the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most hated bull market ever; people keep fighting it, fighting it,\u201d says Gary Fullam, chief investment officer at investment adviser Globalt Investments in Atlanta.\n\nThe average diversified U.S.-stock mutual fund posted a total return of 4.8% in the third quarter, and such funds are up 6.4% for the year so far, according to data from Thomson Reuters Corp. \u2019s Lipper unit.\n\nBond-focused funds were also up. Funds focused on intermediate-maturity, investment-grade debt, the most commonly held type of fixed-income bonds, gained 0.8% in the third quarter and are up 5.9% for the year.\n\nBut the economy and corporate profits are lackluster, and investors are at the mercy of the Federal Reserve, which has kept interest rates at historically low levels but could start lifting them in coming months. One sign of either optimism or hubris: The quarter was marked by a turn toward more-risky sectors such as financials and tech.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all left with, how long can this go on? And the answer is, no one knows. And that\u2019s the most frustrating thing for any investor,\u201d says Mr. Fullam. \u201cThere truly is no alternative unless you want to sit in cash, at which point you lose money every day.\u201d These days, he is emphasizing stocks of U.S. companies that continue to pay dividends, as well as growth stocks that are expanding revenues and earnings in a low-growth global environment.\n\nGlobal picture\n\nGlobal stocks, a significant portion of many investors\u2019 holdings, perked up in the third quarter but have been a drag on portfolios this year. International-stock funds were up 6.2% for the quarter, but on average are trailing their U.S. counterparts for the year so far, with a 3.3% return.\n\nInvestors\u2019 misgivings are reflected in the continued selling of stock funds. According to fund-flow estimates from the Investment Company Institute, U.S.-stock funds suffered net selling of $68.31 billion in the third quarter, while foreign-stock funds were also in the red for fund flows, with net sales of $18.87 billion. Bond funds, in contrast, took in a net $65.02 billion.\n\nBest sectors\n\nOne of the few stock-fund sectors with a double-digit gain in the quarter was science and technology, with an 11.4% gain, pushing the sector into the black for the year so far. Apple Inc. stock was a prominent gainer in the quarter, up 18%, after the release of the new iPhone.\n\nGold-oriented funds were down 1.3% in the quarter but were due for a pause after a rollicking year. Gold funds, which benefit from a weaker dollar and low yields from other investments, have nearly doubled in value this year.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-large-stocks-wake-up-at-this-time-of-year-1476065101", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "It might be time to reduce your portfolio exposure to the smallest-cap stocks while increasing it to the largest-cap issues. Illustration: Wesley Bedrosian for The Wall Street Journal\n\nHistory suggests that some of the best-performing stocks between now and year\u2019s end will be those of the very largest firms.\n\nIf so, that would certainly represent a reversal of what has taken place so far this year. Through Sept. 30, the Russell 2000 index (a widely used small-cap benchmark) gained 11.5%, compared with just 6.8% for the 50 largest publicly traded U.S. companies (as judged by the Russell Top 50 Mega Cap Index).\n\nWhen looking at the historical pattern of large firms vs. small, it\u2019s important to separate the beginning of the year from later. Over the entire period since 1926, the smallest-cap stocks have beaten the largest by an average of 2 percentage points a year on an annualized basis, according to a market-history database maintained by Ibbotson Associates, a unit of Morningstar.\n\nWhat few realize about this historical average, however, is that it traces to the first months of the calendar, especially January. The overall pattern reverses itself in the last quarter of a year. In the fourth quarter of all years since 1926, according to data compiled by University of Chicago professor Eugene Fama and Dartmouth\u2019s Kenneth French, the 20% of stocks with the largest market caps beat the smallest-cap quintile by an average of 1.3 percentage points.\n\nReasons it happens\n\nA number of factors conspire to create this year-end pattern. Widely cited is tax-loss selling, when investors sell their losing positions to shelter from taxes the profits they may have realized earlier in the year. A related factor is so-called end-of-year window dressing, in which fund managers and other institutional investors sell their losers to avoid the embarrassment of having to report holding them in their year-end reports.\n\nBoth factors have a disproportionate impact on the small-cap sector, because smaller stocks are more volatile than the largest-cap stocks. This means that, at a given time, a greater number of smaller caps will be at a loss position for year-to-date performance and be candidates for year-end tax-loss selling and window dressing.\n\nTo be sure, both tax-loss selling and portfolio window dressing are well-known phenomena. That raises the concern that turn-of-year patterns in the stock market might fade as more investors try to exploit them. Donald Keim, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, says there already is some evidence that small-cap strength in January has begun to weaken.\n\nThere is a third explanation that is more obscure, even though it was identified in an academic study in the April 2000 issue of the Journal of Business Finance and Accounting. Its authors were finance professors: George Athanassakos of the University of Western Ontario and Lucy Ackert of Kennesaw State University.\n\nThey found evidence that money managers\u2019 compensation incentives lead their risk tolerance to be greatest in January and lowest in December. As I\u2019ve written before, a consequence is that managers in January tend to load up portfolios with riskier small-cap stocks and then, as year-end approaches, increasingly favor the largest-cap stocks.\n\nThough Profs. Ackert and Athanassakos haven\u2019t updated their study, they believe the phenomenon they identified remains just as strong. It reflects conflicts of interest on the part of managers that \u201chave not changed\u201d and are \u201cunlikely to change in the future,\u201d Prof. Athanassakos says.\n\nHow to bet on it\n\nOne way of betting that the rest of 2016 will live up to the historical pattern is to reduce your portfolio exposure to the smallest-cap stocks while increasing it to the largest-cap issues. According to FactSet, among the 50 largest-cap stocks, the five nonfinancial issues with the lowest price/earnings ratios are Gilead Sciences, with a P/E ratio of 6.6; International Business Machines, at 11.7; Cisco Systems, at 12.9; AbbVie, at 13.1; and Verizon Communications, at 13.3. The comparable P/E for the S&P 500 is 18.5. (P/Es were based on estimated earnings per share over the next 12 months; financials were excluded because their P/Es aren\u2019t generally comparable to nonfinancial stocks.)\n\nAlternatively, investors could put their money in an exchange-traded fund benchmarked to the entire large-cap sector. One with particularly low expenses is Vanguard Large-Cap ETF (VV) with a 0.08% expense ratio, or $8 a year per $10,000 invested.\n\nManagers in January tend to load up portfolios with riskier small-cap stocks and then, as year-end approaches, increasingly favor the largest-cap stocks. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nA market-neutral way of exploiting year-end large-cap relative strength: Sell short a small-cap ETF, allocating the same amount you have invested in large-caps. You make money even if the stock market declines between now and year\u2019s end, so long as the average large-cap loses less than the typical small-cap. Vanguard Small-Cap ETF (VB) is one of the lowest-cost options for small-cap exposure, also with a 0.08% expense ratio.\n\nMr. Hulbert is editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest and a senior columnist for MarketWatch.

Just don\u2019t expect a smooth ride.\n\nBitcoin is a highly speculative investment\u2014the kind most financial advisers say investors should only buy into with money they can afford to lose. But some analysts think the new fund could bring the digital currency a step closer to broader acceptance by investors. For that to happen, the fund will have to overcome some early difficulties.\n\nBitcoin Investment Trust started trading on the OTCQX market on May 4 under the ticker symbol GBTC. It isn\u2019t technically an exchange-traded fund, but it\u2019s designed to work like one. (The Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing an application for what would be the first official bitcoin ETF, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. )\n\nBitcoin Investment Trust is small, with a net asset value of only $35.6 million at the end of June and only 1.4 million shares outstanding. Its tracking of bitcoin\u2019s price has been inconsistent, and there is a wide spread between the share price and the value of the underlying assets. Oh, and by the end of last month the share price had fallen 28% from its $42 close on the first day of trading, to $30.12.\n\nSparking interest?\n\nStill, some analysts think the fund could prompt some speculative interest in bitcoin, like the launch of gold ETFs did in precious metals a decade ago.\n\nGil Luria, an analyst with brokerage firm Wedbush Securities who has followed the bitcoin market since its infancy, sees Bitcoin Investment Trust as part of bitcoin\u2019s move toward the mainstream of finance. Other recent signs of acceptance on Wall Street include the decision of the New York State Department of Financial Services to regulate itBit Trust Co., a small bitcoin exchange, and research from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. claiming a place for bitcoin in \u201cthe future of finance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe OTCQX listing is also a very big step forward,\u201d says Mr. Luria. \u201cIt has made at least a proxy ownership stake in bitcoin available to practically every institutional and retail investor.\u201d Anyone can buy bitcoin directly, but it involves headaches including the need for specialized software for secure transactions.\n\nWhen the SPDR Gold Shares ETF launched in November 2004, gold futures were trading at about $400 an ounce. The popularity of the fund was part of a gold craze that saw prices quintuple over the next seven years. \u201cInvestors historically have chosen to offload the friction of buying and securing gold directly for a reasonable fee,\u201d says Cameron Winklevoss, one of the founders of Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. \u201cWe believe some investors will behave the same with regards to bitcoin and a bitcoin [exchange-traded product].\u201d\n\nBitcoin is even more volatile than gold in its speculative heyday, and even trickier to buy and sell directly. And the bitcoin market is far smaller and younger than the gold market was in 2004. But there are reasons to believe bitcoin usage could increase. In a recent Goldman Sachs survey of 752 millennials, 44% said they have used, do use or will use bitcoin. And well over 100,000 merchants world-wide, from individuals to corporations, accept bitcoin for at least some payments, the firm says.\n\nShare shortage\n\nIn addition to investors\u2019 attitudes about the digital currency, Bitcoin Investment Trust is wrestling with some practical issues. For one, the fund\u2019s shares trade at a sizable premium to the underlying assets\u201419% on July 1. That\u2019s because of the fund\u2019s origins as a private trust.\n\nInvestors in the private trust could sell their shares on the public market after a 12-month lockup. Those sales began May 4, but shares have only become available gradually as the private investors liquidate their holdings. The shortage of shares has boosted their market value.\n\nThe bitcoin fund has high fees by ETF standards, at 2%. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nBut Mr. Luria expects nearly all of the original trust investors to sell their shares publicly by September, creating what he calls a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of shares on the market\u2014or enough to bring the price of the fund\u2019s shares more into line with prices on the bitcoin market.\n\nThe fund also has high fees by ETF standards, at 2%. And it may soon have competition from the proposed Winklevoss fund. Already, Nasdaq has launched an exchange-traded note that tracks the price of bitcoin on its Stockholm exchange.\n\nHowever investors come to view the fund, some veteran money managers see it as the latest in a long line of tenuous and risky investment products.\n\n\u201cI think a bitcoin ETF says as much about the popularity of ETFs as it does about the popularity of bitcoin,\u201d says Eric Marshall, a portfolio manager for mutual-fund firm Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. \u201cNow there\u2019s an ETF for everything.\u201d\n\nMr. Curran, a writer in Denton, Texas, is a regular contributor to Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.

Getty Images\n\nTalk about a bit of risk: Meet the bitcoin funds.\n\nSome wealthy investors are already buying into a trust that tracks the average dollar price of the virtual currency. And the firm behind that trust is racing one other to bring bitcoins to the masses in the form of a publicly traded fund.\n\nBitcoins were worth about $10 each less than two years ago, then more than $1,100 a few months later, and now trade around $475.\n\nWhile some analysts expect a surge in the price of bitcoins as soon as a publicly traded fund draws new investors into the market, prospective fund investors should consider three extraordinary risks.\n\nFirst, as is clear from their price history, bitcoins are extremely volatile. Second, it is still uncertain whether bitcoins\u2014which are simply strings of numbers that have won acceptance as a payment method for some online transactions\u2014will grow into something approaching a mainstream currency, fade into oblivion or just remain a novelty of limited use.\n\nAnd third, if hackers robbed the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange, as its owners allege, they might be able to pull off a similar heist in the virtual vaults of the funds.\n\nUncommon Risk\n\n\"The main risk of investing in bitcoin is that it's a financial instrument unlike any other that we've ever had,\" says Gil Luria, an analyst with the brokerage firm Wedbush Securities. \"It's more difficult to value, more difficult to understand, and at this point in time, more difficult to buy and sell than any other financial instrument.\"\n\nThis inscrutability is one reason the Securities and Exchange Commission is taking more time than usual reviewing an application for what would be the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund. The SEC usually takes about a year to approve an ETF, but it is still reviewing an application for a bitcoin fund 14 months after it was filed. That fund, to be called Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust and carry the ticker symbol COIN, comes from the brothers Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss.\n\nThe already existing Bitcoin Investment Trust bypassed SEC scrutiny because it launched as a private trust open only to accredited investors in September 2013. As of late July, the trust, known as BIT, had attracted assets of roughly $70 million, says Barry Silbert, founder and chairman of SecondMarket Holdings Inc., which manages the trust. That makes the trust the holder of about 1% of all bitcoin outstanding.\n\nBitcoin ledger entries. SiliconAngle/blockr.io\n\nBIT has accumulated the assets despite relatively high administrative fees of 2% and the fact that it is closed to everyone except investors who make more than $200,000 a year or control assets of more than $1 million (excluding primary residences) and the minimum investment is $25,000. Cameron Winklevoss says his firm hasn't set COIN's fee structure.\n\nMr. Silbert says SecondMarket aims to convert BIT into a publicly tradable bitcoin fund in the fourth quarter of this year.\n\nBIT wouldn't technically be an exchange-traded fund like existing ETFs, because of its listing on the over-the-counter OTCQX market, owned by OTC Markets Group Inc., rather than on an SEC-regulated exchange. But it would work much like an ETF, making bitcoin as easy to buy as a penny stock.\n\nMuch as he believes in bitcoin, Mr. Silbert cautions investors against sinking more money into his fund than they can stand to lose. A 10% loss, a plunge for the stock market, is a relatively quiet day for bitcoin. Says Mr. Winklevoss: \"Traders love volatility and volatility doesn't make an ETF product problematic; for a lot of people it makes it more relevant and more interesting.\"\n\nMr. Luria, the Wedbush analyst, says the average fund investor should think of bitcoin as a \"highly speculative investment, which means that it has a very high potential reward as well as a very high potential risk.\"\n\nIf bitcoin can do the same thing for finance that the Internet did for communications and shopping, a single unit could be worth \"hundreds of thousands of dollars\" in 10 years, Mr. Luria says. But he says there's also a good chance the bitcoin revolution won't reach the tipping point, in which case the currency could be \"worth nothing at all.\"\n\nThe Security Question\n\nMr. Silbert says he modeled his fund's structure on that of SPDR Gold Trust, one of the most successful nonstock ETFs, which tracks the price of gold. But there's a difference between a fund backed by tons of metal and one backed by strings of numbers. Auditors regularly count the gold ingots stored in a vault in London on behalf of SPDR Gold Trust. Mr. Silbert declined to comment on how the Bitcoin Trust's holdings would be audited.\n\n\"The core issue is custody,\" says Dave Nadig, chief investment officer for research firm ETF.com. \"If you put the money in the bank, you know it's going to be there,\" he says. \"If you buy a bunch of stock at Schwab, there's a fair amount of certainty that those stocks will be accounted for and be in their custody.\" But there isn't that level of certainty with bitcoin, he says, as illustrated by the disappearance of millions of dollars' worth of bitcoin from the Mt. Gox exchange.\n\nThe Winklevoss fund will keep the private keys\u2014the numbers bitcoin holders use to authorize transactions in the currency\u2014locked in a vault where they will be inspected by a security firm twice a year, according to SEC filings. But the section on risk factors in the SEC filing for the ETF warns investors that private keys could be stolen by hackers or otherwise lost. Indeed, it warns, the whole bitcoin system could be hijacked by \"botnets\"\u2014networks of computers that have been taken over by hackers.\n\nThe Long View\n\nFor investors willing to take that risk, there is still the question of what bitcoin ultimately will be worth.\n\n\"Once [an ETF] comes out, there might be new individuals getting interested, and that results in a near-term bump to the price,\" says David Ripley, chief executive of Glidera Inc., a Chicago maker of software that secures bitcoin users' wallets.\n\n\"That doesn't affect long-term price,\" he says. \"The long term depends on whether the bitcoin network is adopted for its core properties to purchase goods and transfer money.\"\n\nMr. Curran, a writer in Denton, Texas, is a regular contributor to Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.

Over Labor Day weekend the year before, news broke that New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer was investigating mutual-fund companies for allowing hedge funds to engage in trading of mutual-fund shares that hurt long-term investors and in some cases was outright illegal.\n\nBy the time the investigations by Mr. Spitzer and the Securities and Exchange Commission wound down, more than a dozen fund companies agreed to $3.1 billion in fines, restitutions and fee cuts. Dozens of fund-company employees\u2014including high-profile executives\u2014lost jobs.\n\nThese days the fund scandal has faded from investor consciousness, pushed to the background by the latest financial crisis.\n\nBut there was a lasting impact, evident in the popularity of index investing and exchange-traded funds, among other things. The scandal focused attention on whether fund companies and their boards were acting in the best interest of fund shareholders.\n\n\"The scandal had a profound cultural impact on the fund industry that still ripples today,\" says Russel Kinnel of fund-research firm Morningstar. \"Look at the types of funds launched before and after the scandal. Look at communication with fund investors. There have been fee cuts at quite a few funds since then.\"\n\nGreed Backfires\n\nThe wrongdoing involved \"market timing,\" in which traders moved in and out of funds to profit from short-term pricing discrepancies. Then there was illegal \"late trading,\" in which traders were allowed to place orders to buy or sell after the 4 p.m. close but still get that day's share price\u2014in essence betting on a game after it was over.\n\nCentral to the fund scandal: Some fund executives placed hauling in assets\u2014and profits\u2014above the interests of fund shareholders.\n\nIt \"was a real wake-up call,\" says Paul Haaga, a former executive at American Funds, which wasn't implicated in the scandal, and who at the time was also chairman of the Investment Company Institute trade group. The scandal showed the perils of business plans that are \"short-term profitable and long-term harmful to shareholders.\"\n\nLost Trust\n\nThe scandal was a lesson in reputational risk, says John Bogle, founder of fund giant Vanguard Group. \"It's easier to lose the trust of investors than to regain it.\"\n\nMany of the firms with the most egregious behavior were among those whose funds had been crushed by the collapse of the tech-stock bubble, or had launched gimmicky tech-focused portfolios. Years of investor withdrawals followed.\n\nSome of those \"still haven't recovered because the combination of bad returns and unethical behavior was nearly fatal,\" says Mr. Kinnel. \"On the flip side, it accelerated growth at firms that did well in the bear market and came out of the scandal clean.\" He points to Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and American Funds as beneficiaries.\n\nTo some degree, that investor disillusionment accelerated the move to index-based mutual funds.\n\nBut Mr. Bogle says some of the improved behavior in the business hasn't carried over to exchange-traded funds. He points to narrowly focused ETFs, such as ones that concentrate on cloud computing, as marketing gimmicks rather than long-term investment strategies. \"They're focused on the short term and you can raise money. But no investor is going to get rich,\" he says.\n\nA decade-plus after the fund scandal, the fund industry's focus on investors \"has improved, but we still have a long way to go.\"\n\nMr. Lauricella a reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThat exchange-traded funds will continue to vacuum up assets in 2017 is a given. But will ETF issuers find better ways for investors to make money, or merely fight among themselves for market share?\n\nIn 2016, ETFs\u2014which are similar to mutual funds but trade like stocks\u2014gathered $280 billion. Assets closed the year at $2.17 trillion in stock, $436 billion in fixed-income and $175 billion in commodity, currency and other ETF strategies, according to data tracker XTF. But the year was also punctuated by a price war and record ETF closures, at 127.\n\nIn fact, despite the asset growth, product innovation is on a plateau. According to Elisabeth Kashner, director of ETF research at FactSet, only 11 out of 237 funds launched in 2016 exceeded $100 million in assets, half as many as in 2015. Diminishing marginal returns on new index products will likely lead to continued consolidation among ETF issuers and a more aggressive push by traditional fund issuers for active (or quasi-active) products in more-tradable wrappers, such as actively managed ETFs or a new structure dubbed NextShares introduced by Eaton Vance last February. NextShares trade on an exchange like an ETF, but don\u2019t disclose their holdings daily, as almost all ETFs do.\n\nHere are five trends that will move the ETF market in 2017:\n\n1. Lower expenses on funds (but still with other costs to pay)\n\n\u201cMuch of index-fund outperformance can be attributed to the cost differential,\u201d said Vanguard Chairman William McNabb at November\u2019s Evidence-Based Investing Conference in New York. And Vanguard, which manages $3.3 trillion in the U.S., including $612 billion in ETFs, closed out 2016 by announcing that expense ratios had been reduced on 11 of its ETFs as assets continued to climb.\n\nWhile some of the plainest ETFs feature expense ratios below 0.05%, including products from Vanguard, BlackRock and Charles Schwab, the new flank of the fee fight will be in the growing market for \u201csmart beta\u201d ETFs, which weight their holdings according to complex formulas including volatility and valuation, among other factors.\n\nFees shouldn\u2019t blind investors to other costs related to ETFs, however, such as premiums and discounts relative to a fund\u2019s intraday net asset value (iNAV), trading spreads and commissions.\n\n\u201cInvestors continue to learn more about the different facets that go into ETF prices and why they cost what they do,\u201d says Tim Coyne, head of global capital markets for State Street \u2019s SPDR ETFs.\n\n2. Resolving the adviser-conflicts rule\n\nThe Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule, colloquially known as \u201cthe DOL,\u201d is slated to take effect on April 10. The rule requires retirement-account advisers to always act in the best interests of their clients, free of conflicts driven by product sales and asset churn. A report by McKinsey & Co. in November called the rule \u201cone of the largest shocks to the wealth management industry in over 40 years.\u201d\n\nThe rule\u2019s opponents say it will limit access to advice. The Trump administration or new Congress could try to head it off. But even if they do, ETFs and low-cost index funds are still expected to see a rush of new assets as advisers have already taken the spirit of the new rule to heart. The investment tide continues to move against funds with sales loads or trailer fees that compensate advisers or platforms.\n\n\u201cWhether DOL moves forward or shifts in the future is less important than the fact that brokerage firms have already started down the path of announcing fee-structure changes and shifts for retirement and other advised accounts,\u201d says Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual and ETF research at CFRA Research in New York.\n\n3. A bigger smart-beta push\n\nSmart-beta ETFs, ascendant for years, are extending their purview to include new approaches to fixed-income, value and dividend investing.\n\nIn fact, smart-beta ETFs are attracting institutional investors and emerging as a real challenger for higher-cost quantitative strategies and even hedge funds. U.S.-listed smart-beta ETFs in 2016 drew more than $41 billion in assets through Nov. 30, ending the period with $540 billion, according to Morningstar.\n\nInvestors still want to see evidence of outperformance and risk control. BlackRock, meanwhile, has cut expenses on its multifactor ETFs and filed for approval to bring out mutual-fund versions of its U.S.-listed size, factor, value and momentum \u201ctilt\u201d ETFs.\n\n4.Transformers: Expect more robot/human combinations\n\nA few years ago, upstart \u201crobo advisers\u201d were looking to feast on brokers and financial advisers by offering sophisticated, tax-aware investment portfolios with automated rebalancing built almost exclusively on ETFs.\n\nBut as the world of automated advice expanded to established brands and workplace retirement plans, an approach that still features a human component is winning the day\u2014led by Vanguard and its Personal Advisor Services accounts and Charles Schwab\u2019s announcement of a competing hybrid product.\n\nMore customized advice in workplace plans is coming, too, including incorporation of and adjustment for employee assets outside of the plan.\n\n5. And staying \u2018active\u2019 can pay off\n\nFor some active investors, the past year showed the benefits of overweighting or underweighting specific ETFs\u2014and rebalancing frequently enough to capture gains before any reversion to the mean. For example, iShares MSCI Mexico Capped ETF (EWW) became an active proxy for investors speculating on the future of U.S.-Mexico trade during the election season, and flows into financial ETFs jumped in December amid talk of a looser regulatory regime for banks.\n\nActive trading in ETFs, however, requires knowledge of what differentiates ETFs with similar exposures, and an understanding of the potential investment implications of domestic and international policy and rhetoric. In other words, a buy-and-hold investor might do better to focus on trend No. 1: enjoying the low costs of a broad-market fund.\n\nMr. Weinberg is a writer in Connecticut.

Illustration: Greg Mably for The Wall Street Journal\n\nCan an interesting stock symbol move markets?\n\nA study published in the Journal of Financial Markets finds that the \u201clikability\u201d and even the pronounceability of a ticker symbol are positively related to a stock\u2019s value. In other words, if your stock can\u2019t have the symbol IBM or AAPL, at least pick a clever one.\n\nThe researchers asked undergraduate business students at the University of Central Florida to rate three-letter ticker symbols from 1,959 publicly traded companies based on how much they liked them and how easy they were to pronounce. The paper found that valuations of shares with symbols the students liked, including ACE, BRO and LUV, were about 1.3 percentage points higher than valuations of those with handles rated less favorably, like CFW, JWN and ZQK. Symbols were from a sample period from 1982 to 2011.\n\nThe difference isn\u2019t negligible. If two otherwise identical companies each have $1 billion of assets, for instance, the one with the more likable ticker symbol could be valued by investors at $13 million more, according to the study\u2019s logic.\n\nWhat may account for the bump, the study says, is that a likable symbol is associated with greater liquidity, since investors also tend to trade stocks with more-likable symbols at a higher rate. Alternatively, the study suggests, a higher value could be the result of mispricing; investors might unconsciously assign a higher value to a symbol that is easier to pronounce. The study controlled for possible differences in valuations of samples taken in different years.\n\nXuejing Xing, a co-author of the study and an associate professor of finance at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, says ticker symbols convey little information about a company, which makes it easier to isolate their effect on stock prices from other variables such as future cash flows and risk. Ticker symbols, too, are usually only remotely related to their company names, he says, so judgment of a symbol likely isn\u2019t influenced by knowledge of a company\u2019s financial success, failure or any other mitigating factors that could affect perception.\n\nNot so fast, says Russell Jame, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Kentucky. Yes, he says, the study\u2019s findings are broadly consistent with his own research, showing companies with easy-to-pronounce names have higher value and liquidity. But stock names aren\u2019t empty vessels, he says. Recognizable symbols like BUD and IBM were highly rated, he says, possibly because of their natural association with popular companies.\n\n\u2018When you pick out the name of your stock, you need to be really careful.\u2019 \u2014Xuejing Xing, co-author of the study\n\nIt\u2019s also possible, says T. Clifton Green, a professor of finance at Emory University, that a likable stock could directly signal marketing on the part of the firm, which might influence judgment of its symbol\u2019s likability. EAT, for instance, may not convey information about its related company, Brinker International Inc., which owns Chili\u2019s, but it\u2019s a \u201ccute\u201d name, says Mr. Green. \u201cThat influences the likability of the ticker,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a signal of management quality, so people might give it a higher valuation.\u201d\n\nOther studies have agreed that companies with easy-to-pronounce names have higher value and liquidity.

Meanwhile, he says, his recent paper can serve as a caution for investors who may not be aware of their innate market biases.\n\n\u201cWhen you pick out the name of your stock,\u201d Mr. Xing says, \u201cyou need to be really careful.\u201d\n\nMr. Kassel is a writer in New York.

Illustration: Stephen Webster/ Worldwide Hideout\n\nBonds issued by governments and companies are priced high these days. In the seesaw relation of bond prices to their yields, prices are up, and yields are smacking hard against the ground, at record lows.\n\nInvestors, wary of stock valuations and looking desperately for yield, have poured money into bonds and bond funds.\n\nThere was a brief scare in September when bond prices suddenly fell over concerns that the Federal Reserve and other central banks might end their \u201ceasy money\u201d policies.\n\nBut that pullback quickly vanished, with investors convinced that the Fed will move slowly in eventually raising rates. Bond prices recovered.\n\nSo, are we left with a valuation bubble that will burst, as tech-stock investors experienced more than 15 years ago? Or are the worries merely another false alarm, which bond investors have heard before for many years?\n\nRobert C. Pozen, a senior lecturer at MIT Sloan School of Management and former mutual-fund executive, argues that the situation is verging on a bubble as yield-hungry investors are gravitating toward riskier bonds. Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, says he doesn\u2019t see the credit excesses that would qualify this market as a bubble.\n\nYES: Investors Are Reaching for Yield, at Their Peril\n\nBy Robert C. Pozen\n\nMr. Pozen says to be careful before buying bonds these days. Photo: Russ Campbell\n\nThe global bond markets are verging on a bubble, which will likely result in a significant loss of principal value for major types of bonds by the end of 2017.\n\nFor many investors, the stock market seems overpriced, so they are seeking better returns in bonds, whether U.S. Treasurys, corporate junk bonds or emerging-markets securities. As buyers pour in, bond prices are soaring and yields (which decline as prices rise) are shrinking.\n\nThe situation verges on a bubble not only because bond yields are at historic lows, but also because investors are gravitating to lower-quality and longer-term bonds with higher risks. When these risks become realities, bond investors will flock to the exits\u2014reducing liquidity and further depressing bond prices. If the bubble deflates, bond holders will experience deep declines in the current value of their bond portfolios.\n\nThe rate question\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the situation in U.S. Treasurys. Because of the unorthodox tactics of the Federal Reserve, including massive bond purchases, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was down below 1.4% in July, the lowest on record\u2014even lower than in 1933, when the U.S. unemployment rate reached 25%.\n\nTo obtain higher yields, some investors have bought 30-year Treasury bonds. Yet the yield on these longer bonds is only 2.47%, down from 3% in January. If interest rates revert to January levels, the current value of $100,000 of these bonds will drop by over $10,000.\n\nTrue, central banks in Europe have gone negative on interest rates, and the U.S. could do the same. But the Fed faces pressure to raise rates, and I believe it must relent. Rates are too low to be sustainable with improving economic trends. U.S. prices\u2014the key driver of interest rates\u2014have risen for most of the year in health care, housing and wages. These trends were reinforced by the Labor Department\u2019s report that \u201ccore prices\u201d\u2014minus food and energy\u2014rose 0.3% in August alone.\n\nInvestors face similar risks with junk bonds, those rated below investment grade. Very low yields make these bonds vulnerable to modest rises in interest rates. Between January and August, the current yields on double-B bonds fell to 4.5% from 6.8%; on single-B bonds, to 6% from 10%; and on triple-C, to 13.6% from 19.7%.\n\nMoreover, many investors have gravitated to the \u201cjunkiest\u201d of the junk\u2014rated triple-C or lower. This rating means that bond defaults are likely or imminent. In the event of defaults, investors trying to sell junk bonds will find few buyers and face steep losses.\n\nThe overseas picture\n\nFinally, yield-hungry U.S. investors have piled into emerging-markets bonds\u2014again, creating huge interest-rate risks. Can you believe that the interest rate on 10-year Bulgarian bonds is 1.8%\u2014only slightly higher than 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds?\n\nThe worst danger lurks in emerging-markets bonds issued in the currency of the local country. This raises two special risks for sizable U.S. bond funds.\n\nFirst, if U.S. interest rates rise, the dollar will strengthen and local currencies will weaken. So these bonds\u2019 value will fall on currency alone. Second, local-currency bond markets are thinly traded. If problems occur in these emerging markets, U.S. investors will not easily sell these bonds.\n\nSome argue against a bond bubble because in theory people can\u2019t expect that the value of a bond at maturity will rise. More pragmatically, they argue that investors in bonds tend to hold them for the long term.\n\nBut that ignores the reality of bond investment. Most investors aren\u2019t willing to hold bonds for 20 to 30 years, so drops in current values have a negative impact over shorter periods. Also, many investors buy bonds through mutual funds, which effectively don\u2019t have a fixed maturity date.\n\nIn short, with investors reaching for yield into low-quality bonds, small bumps in the road will cause significant portfolio losses. And the bigger threat lies on the highway ahead: The losses will multiply if central bankers hint that their massive support for bonds will diminish. So be careful before buying bonds; we are on the verge of a bubble.\n\nMr. Pozen is a senior lecturer at MIT Sloan School of Management and former mutual-fund executive.

Photo: Jeff Wojtaszek\n\nAre we in a bond bubble? Or heading toward one? No.\n\nAn asset bubble requires a few things. Chief among them is the purchase of an asset at progressively higher prices with ongoing speculation that tomorrow and the day after that the asset\u2019s value will increase. Investors paid astronomical sums for now-defunct dot-com companies in 1999 because they thought company valuations would continuously rise in 2000, in 2005, in 2010 and so on.\n\nThis definition is critically important in discussing the presence of bubbles in the bond market. Bonds, by their nature, have maturity dates\u2014a point in the future when a given security will be worth a fixed sum of money. Mathematically, therefore, it is impossible for the value of a bond to be worth progressively more moving forward. As a result, it\u2019s metaphysically impossible for an individual bond\u2014and, by extension, the entire bond market\u2014to be in a bubble.\n\nThe reality of the market\n\nWhile charges of a bond bubble are clearly acquitted on this technicality, there\u2019s a reasonable argument to be made that many types of bonds are currently overvalued. Inflation expectations are low, but if they do rise significantly, fixed-income investors would face market-value losses. The price of credit risk is also low, but if investors start pricing the risk that a sovereign or company might default more highly, market values of many types of bonds would presumably decline. Supply in higher-quality bonds has been growing only modestly, and demand for these assets is clearly strong\u2014but if either of these components change with, say, a global infrastructure-spending binge, it\u2019s possible that investors could face broad declines in bonds\u2019 market values.\n\nThat said, any move to higher inflation is likely to be gradual, and expectations are still compressed. Credit-risk pricing has already harmed investors in 2015 and early 2016 with limited lasting effects. And the supply of bonds hasn\u2019t increased nor demand waned even years after the low-interest-rate environment became truly entrenched. To think that all of these factors will change on a dime, without investors across the globe clamoring to buy bonds with higher returns, belies the last half-decade of the bond market\u2019s experience.\n\nHow investors really buy\n\nThe bigger error that bubble doomsayers make is that they ignore how people and institutions actually buy bonds. Most individual investors, even many who purchase corporate junk bonds, are in it for the long haul, and they don\u2019t intend to make short-term trades\u2014which means that they won\u2019t run for the exits if there are big price swings in the bond market. They intend to recoup the fixed value of the bonds at the maturity date, and don\u2019t care what happens before then.\n\nTrue, that\u2019s not necessarily the case for individual holders of bond mutual funds, who have a greater tendency to rush for the exits when returns turn negative. Fortunately, a few 2015 \u201ccrowded exit\u201d scares have encouraged many major bond mutual funds to step up liquidity by taking out, for example, bank lines of credit. That way, if there is a rush to the exits, those mutual funds can still sell down their holdings in a gradual, orderly manner.\n\nWhen it comes to institutions, according to Federal Reserve data, more than half of bond owners\u2014a group that includes banks, insurance companies, pension funds and more\u2014face restrictions that don\u2019t allow them to unload bonds and head for stocks if bond prices turn down. So how will this supposed bond bubble burst?\n\nIn conclusion, consider a quote from Jim Chanos, the guru of short selling: \u201cBubbles are best identified by credit excesses, not valuation excesses.\u201d Is the U.S. government issuing debt to excess? Net issuance of Treasury notes and bonds is down 30% year-to-date through the end of August. Are U.S. high-yield companies issuing debt to excess? Gross high-yield issuance is down more than 20% year-to-date.\n\nThat story is repeated time and again across fixed-income markets in the U.S. and abroad. Simply put, if there\u2019s no possibility of perpetually higher valuations and no evidence of credit excesses, there can be no bubble in the bond markets.\n\nMr. LeBas is chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.

Whether such a conversion makes sense depends heavily on tax rates\u2014of both the account owner and heirs\u2014and whether lawmakers approve proposed rule changes that could eliminate some of the estate-planning perks of Roths.\n\nWhat Could Change\n\nMany people use Roths for bequests because account holders don't have to start taking distributions at age 70\u00bd as they do with traditional IRAs. The money can sit untouched and grow tax-free throughout the owner's lifetime\u2014a big plus for those who don't need the assets to live on. And while those who inherit any type of IRA must start taking distributions immediately, they are permitted to stretch out those payments over their lifetime, allowing the bulk of a Roth account to continue growing tax-free.\n\nRelated Video High earners can't contribute directly to popular Roth individual retirement accounts. But there's still a way in. We explain a simple two-step strategy that works for many people. WSJ's Karen Damato explains.\n\nTwo proposals in President Obama's 2015 budget, if approved, would change all that.\n\nThe first would require Roth owners to start taking distributions at age 70\u00bd. If that happens, \"that asset pool might be pretty much wiped out by the time I get to leave anything to my heirs,\" says Jamie Hopkins, a professor in the retirement income program at the American College in Bryn Mawr, Pa.\n\nThe second would end the ability of nonspousal IRA beneficiaries to stretch distributions. Instead, inherited IRAs would have to be disbursed within five years of the owner's death. (Certain beneficiaries would be exempt.)\n\nThat proposal, if enacted, would reduce the estate-planning benefits of Roths. Contributions to Roths are made with after-tax money, while withdrawals are tax-free as long as certain rules are met. The opposite is true of traditional IRAs: Contributions are pretax, and withdrawals are taxed. As such, the owner of a traditional IRA pays a hefty upfront tax bill to convert to a Roth.\n\n\"If there's no stretch IRA, it doesn't pay for an older person to convert to a Roth,\" says Ed Slott, founder of IRAHelp.com. \"Why should someone 60, 70 years old, who's mainly doing it for their beneficiaries, pay a tax when the deferral rate after they die is limited to five years?\"\n\nWhether these proposals become law remains to be seen.\n\nTo Convert or Not\n\nIn addition to the potential rules changes, there are other issues people need to consider before converting to a Roth to benefit heirs, experts say.\n\n\"The interesting thing about a Roth is that on its surface it always sounds really terrific\u2014until you run the numbers,\" says Nancy Skeans, a partner and managing director of personal financial services at Schneider Downs Wealth Management Advisors in Pittsburgh. Tax rates\u2014what you pay at the time of conversion compared with what you or your heirs would pay on distributions from a traditional IRA\u2014are a critical part of the equation.\n\nIf your tax rate when you convert is the same as the rate you or your heirs would pay on distributions from your traditional IRA, the decision is easy: Roths have a slight advantage. At the time of conversion, \"you're paying the tax from a tax-inefficient bank or brokerage account, and compounding future growth in a fully tax-efficient account,\" says Michael Kitces, publisher of the Kitces Report and a partner at Pinnacle Advisory Group.\n\nBut the Roth's lead is trumped if the beneficiary's tax rate is lower than the account owner's, he says. For example, if you convert to a Roth in California, which levies an income tax, and leave the account to a child in Texas, where there is no state income tax, the Roth advantage is easily overwhelmed.\n\nIf your tax rate is higher now than your children's would be when taking distributions from a traditional IRA, a Roth conversion unnecessarily eats into your children's inheritance. \"We've seen big Roth conversions where someone converts a $3 million IRA all at once. Now we're at a 39.6% tax rate,\" Mr. Kitces says. \"You just blew up a whole bunch of family wealth.\"\n\nStill, for retirees who are enjoying low tax rates, one or a series of conversions can make sense. \"You can do that tax calculation every year and say, 'How much can I bring in from the IRA on an annual basis to get it in at a lower tax rate than the children would pay?' \" Ms. Skeans says.\n\nGetting a handle on future tax rates isn't always easy. But if there are big differences in tax rates between you and your heirs due to career choices or other reasons, it isn't difficult.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure your struggling-artist child isn't going to be in a 39% tax bracket soon,\" Mr. Kitces says.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court recently decided that inherited IRAs aren't protected from a beneficiary's creditors, so those worried about their children's ability to avoid bankruptcy might look to a trust or non-IRA vehicle for bequeathing assets.\n\nMs. Coombes is a writer in San Francisco.

If you cut fees to the bone, avoid complicated products and stick to a basic asset allocation through thick and thin, you\u2019ll do better than most.\n\nHappily, it\u2019s getting easier to take that simple approach. After recent index-fund fee reductions from BlackRock Inc. and Charles Schwab Corp. , a saver can pay as little as 0.04% a year, or $4 on a $10,000 investment, in an S&P 500 fund.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: While rock-bottom fees for individual funds are a welcome development, low fees aren't commonly associated with the go-to investment vehicle for millions of Americans\u2014the 401(k) retirement plan. Indeed, 401(k)s and their menus of funds often are so complex that employees investing in them incur administrative, record-keeping and adviser fees.\n\nThe 401(k) was \u201cinvented by accident,\u201d as a Morningstar report says. It began its life as a clause inserted in the tax code in 1978 to address the tax status of profit-sharing plans. Then it morphed into a savings plan when companies decided to get out of the pension business.\n\nIts strange origins give the 401(k) a baroque structure requiring legal paperwork, filings with the IRS, record-keeping and provisions for participants to borrow from the plans. These features provide opportunities for consultants, lawyers, advisers and accountants to charge additional fees, hindering investors striving for simplicity and frugality. Larger companies tend to pick up the tab for these extra fees, but smaller companies often don\u2019t.\n\nComplexity, multiple fees\n\nVanguard Group, a pioneer in low-cost investing, tells small-business owners in a brochure for its 401(k) services that an all-in annual fee for a $5 million plan (with 100 participants with $50,000 each in their accounts), could be nearly $30,000 or 0.58%. In its estimate, Vanguard lists potential administrative and record-keeping fees at 0.07% each and an adviser fee at 0.25%. These are add-ons to estimated fund fees of 0.19%. (Vanguard\u2019s estimate for fund expenses in this plan includes a combination of index funds with rock-bottom costs and some actively managed funds with higher costs.)\n\nSo while a particular fund\u2019s annual expenses might be only 0.04%, the other administrative and record-keeping fees could make the whole plan cost more than 10 times as much. And investors themselves may have to foot that bill, if their employer chooses not to.\n\nA Vanguard representative, Emily Farrell, says that small businesses have had higher expenses in the past, but that there is now a \u201cshift of the tide\u201d as less-expensive plans like Vanguard\u2019s gain traction.\n\nHowever, administrative, record-keeping and adviser fees still vary from plan to plan. Vanguard and other fund companies often provide administrative and record-keeping functions relatively cheaply, but the fund companies don\u2019t have control over what an adviser may charge a small-business owner for helping set up a plan and providing continuing advice and supervision. Nor do the fund companies offering plans control whether an employer passes the administrative costs on to the participants.\n\nAdditional fees\n\nThere may be additional fees on top of Vanguard\u2019s 0.58% for a $5 million plan, for example, if the plan allows participants to use a managed-account service to pick funds and maintain asset allocations. It isn\u2019t clear why plans should have both a managed-account service and an adviser whose traditional role is choosing funds and portfolio management. But Ms. Farrell says advisers\u2019 roles are expanding, not contracting, as they move into the role of \u201cbehavior coach.\u201d\n\nAnother problem is that while the Labor Department\u2019s new so-called fiduciary rule may push advisers to charge asset-based fees on retirement accounts instead of charging transaction fees, it doesn\u2019t establish hard criteria for asset-based fees.\n\nSo although the Vanguard literature may estimate 0.25% for the adviser\u2019s fee, nothing prevents an adviser from collecting more\u20140.50% or even 1%\u2014to advise a plan. How big a difference is there, one might ask, between annual fees of 0.25% and 0.50%? If a fund investor were to make annual contributions of $5,000 for 40 years and earned a compounded annualized return of 6%, he or she would end up with $773,000 if the fee charged was 0.25%. By contrast, he or she would end up with $727,000 if the fee was 0.50%. That\u2019s a difference of $46,000. If the hypothetical adviser were to charge a fee of 0.75%, meanwhile, the investor would end up with only $683,000. That\u2019s a whopping $90,000 reduction in final savings attributable to a half-point difference in fees.\n\nMost workers should still stuff their 401(k)s with money because of the tax benefits the plans provide, and the matching contributions from employers, when available. But Americans who work for private businesses could use a retirement-savings plan that rivals that of U.S. government employees. The all-in annual cost of the government\u2019s Thrift Savings Plan is 0.029% or $2.90 for every $10,000 invested. That makes it easy for investors seeking to keep things simple and cheap.\n\nMr. Coumarianos, a former Morningstar analyst, is a writer in Laguna Niguel, Calif.

Illustration: Jennifer Van Meter for The Wall Street Journal\n\nTarget-date funds keep growing in popularity for retirement accounts. But many investors may be paying higher fees on these funds than they need to.\n\nThe funds are pitched as automated retirement-planning assets. They are mutual funds made up of other funds\u2014stock, bond and money-market funds\u2014and adjust the balance, getting more conservative as they approach the target date, near the person\u2019s expected retirement.\n\nBut fees often take a sizable bite out of a fund\u2019s returns\u2014particularly a fund designed to be left alone for decades. What\u2019s more, fees are perhaps the only determinant of a fund\u2019s performance that an investor can actually be sure of ahead of time, which makes them particularly important to monitor.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know which fund\u2019s going to do better than another, but what you know is what you pay,\u201d says Scott Donaldson, a senior investment strategist in Vanguard\u2019s Investment Strategy Group, where he puts together target-date funds and retirement funds.\n\nFor the more-than 2,200 target-date funds that Morningstar tracks, the average expense ratio stated in the prospectus is 0.903%. (The company doesn\u2019t maintain historical data on these fees.) But, given a choice, investors don\u2019t need to pay nearly that much.\n\n\u201cTarget-date funds can vary greatly in their costs to the user, and we see in our data a range of expense ratios from 0.10% to over 1.00%,\u201d says Eyran Blumberg, vice president of operations at FeeX, a New York financial-tech startup that helps investors lower the fees they pay on investments.\n\nA 401(k) staple\n\nOf the employer-provided 401(k) plans that FeeX analyzed, 78% had target-date options. Typically they are the default option for payroll contributions if the employee hasn\u2019t selected a different fund, Mr. Blumberg says.\n\nAmong those funds, Fidelity Freedom K 2050, a target-date fund designed for investors who plan to retire in 2050, had an expense ratio of 0.67%, while other funds with the same date and similar portfolios had lower fees. BlackRock LifePath Index 2050 charged 0.45%, while Vanguard Target Retirement 2050 Fund charged 0.16%, Mr. Blumberg says.\n\nTarget-date funds offer a shifting investment allocation over time, known as a glide path, usually by using underlying investments of the same fund family, either cheaper index funds or more-expensive actively managed funds, each of which has its own expense ratio. A target fund\u2019s own resulting expense ratio, thus, is based on the underlying fees and whether the fund manager is charging extra fees on top.\n\nVanguard doesn\u2019t add fees to manage its Target Retirement 2045, which charges 0.16%. That\u2019s the weighted average of the fees of the funds it contains: Vanguard\u2019s Total Stock Market Index, Total International Stock Index, Total Bond Market and Total International Bond Market.\n\nBy contrast, American Funds 2030 Target Date Retirement has 22 funds from the American family, which have a weighted average expense ratio of 0.39%. The target-date fund\u2019s expense ratio is 0.73%, for a 0.34-percentage-point premium over the underlying funds, FeeX found.\n\n\u2018A sign of greed\u2019\n\nExtra premiums are \u201cgenerally a sign of greed,\u201d says David Snowball, publisher of the Mutual Fund Observer in Davenport, Iowa. The fund manager is \u201cdouble-billing you,\u201d Mr. Snowball says.\n\nAn American Funds spokesperson notes that the 2030 Target Date fund offers several share classes with different fee structures, including one limited to employer-sponsored retirement plans that charges 2 basis points (0.02 percentage point) above the underlying funds\u2019 fees. If investors buy target-date funds within an employer plan, the plan administrator is the one who chooses which share class they can buy.\n\n\u201cFees are what you pay, but results are what you can actually spend,\u201d says Craig Duglin, senior manager of defined-contribution product management for American Funds.\n\nVanguard\u2019s Mr. Donaldson, meanwhile, adds his voice to those who emphasize the importance of fees for investors. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important factor,\u201d he says, \u201cespecially when you\u2019re considering target-date funds that are being used very prominently as default investments within 401(k) plans.\u201d\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nExchange-traded funds are increasingly a young investor\u2019s game.\n\nMillennials, the youngest generation of investors, are enamored of ETFs more than older investors are. And ETFs are increasingly being designed with a millennial angle.\n\nIn the latest annual survey of ETF investors by brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corp. , being released this week, 66% of millennials, or Generation Y, say they expect to boost their holdings of exchange-traded funds over the next year. That\u2019s up from 61% in last year\u2019s survey\u2014and well above the 43% of investors in general who say this year that they plan to buy more ETFs.\n\nThe millennials say they are already putting 36% of their investments into ETFs on average, which is down from the 41% in last year\u2019s survey but still well above the 23% allocation reported this year by all investors surveyed.\n\nThe millennials\u2019 preferences could in coming years help shrink the gap in size between the market for traditional mutual funds and the smaller market for their ETF cousins.\n\nDefinitions differ, but a millennial generally is considered to be anyone born from the early 1980s until at least the mid-1990s, with some definitions pushing the limit to the early years of this century. Millennials\u2019 numbers in the U.S. stand at 75.4 million\u2014making them the nation\u2019s biggest generation (sorry, baby boomers)\u2014according to the Pew Research Center\u2019s analysis of recent data from the Census Bureau. Pew defines millennials as those who were age 18 to 34 in 2015. To qualify for the Schwab survey, investors had to be at least 25; for the survey results, millennials are defined as those between 25 and 35.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not something that\u2019s being sold to them across an old oak desk by one of their dad\u2019s friends.\u2019 \u2014Morningstar\u2019s Ben Johnson, on the appeal of ETFs to millennials\n\nMillennials are often eager to invest in specific themes, says Dave Gedeon, head of research and development at Nasdaq Global Indexes.

This may have affected their attitudes toward the funds, says Rich Messina, senior vice president and head of investment products at financial-services provider E*Trade.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re seeing more of that growth, there\u2019s more about it in the news, so I think they\u2019re adopting it a lot more,\u201d he says.\n\nMeanwhile, fund companies are eagerly concocting a number of ETFs that have a millennials angle\u2014funds that aim to benefit from the areas where young consumers are spending their money.\n\nPrincipal Global Investors launched Principal Millennials Index ETF (GENY) in August. While millennials aren\u2019t the biggest spenders on a per capita basis, the sheer size of the generation gives them clout, says Paul Kim, Principal\u2019s managing director, ETF strategy. He adds that their spending habits tend to be focused on certain companies or categories, from technology giants like Amazon.com and Google parent Alphabet to consumer-goods firms like Nike, all of which are among the fund\u2019s holdings.\n\nMillennials spend money differently than other generations in other ways, as well, says Jay Jacobs, director of research at Global X, which runs Global X Millennials Thematic ETF (MILN). For example, they tend to move around a lot for college or jobs, so they rent for longer on average than earlier generations, and tend to rent in urban centers rather than suburbs.

The problem: Investors, desperate for yield with interest rates so low, have driven up the price of dividend stocks to lofty levels.\n\nDividend stampede\n\nFamously low bond yields have encouraged a stampede into stock funds that invest in dividend-rich companies.\n\nResearch from Rob Arnott\u2019s Research Affiliates suggests that as investors move from low-yield bonds into dividend stocks, they are going from the frying pan into the fire. Photo: Tim Boyle/Bloomberg News\n\nVanguard Group closed its $31 billion Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund (VDIGX) to new assets after the fund doubled in size over three years. Fund companies typically close a fund to new investors when the portfolio is in danger of getting too unwieldy to manage\u2014the fund-industry equivalent of a fire marshal putting a limit on the number of people allowed in a room. Vanguard Chief Executive Bill McNabb said, \u201cVanguard is proactively taking steps to slow strong cash flows to help ensure that the adviser\u2019s ability to produce competitive long-term results for investors is not compromised.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Vanguard REIT Index Fund (VGSIX) has grown to $67 billion in assets this year from $38 billion in early 2013 and just $6 billion in early 2009.\n\nThe main REIT indexes have risen 200% since the end of the financial crisis. One reason for this, in addition to the general rebound in real-estate prices since the 2008-09 crash, is that real-estate investment trusts are high-yielding stocks, and the funds that own them, therefore, come with prodigious yields. The trusts pay out 90% of their net income as dividends in exchange for tax-free status at the corporate level. That has made the funds that own them particularly attractive to mutual-fund investors\u2014and to former bond investors in today\u2019s low-yield era.\n\n\u200bSimple math will tell you that a 10-fold increase in the size of the Vanguard REIT Index fund, after a threefold investment return, means investors are throwing dollars at the fund. Based on the fund\u2019s investment return and its current asset level, investors have tossed more than $40 billion into the fund since 2009.\n\nWhat actually is happening, market watchers say, is that investors looking for yield are stuffing these REIT funds with new money as a result of bond yields being so low.\n\nExpensive valuations\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury fell below 4% in July 2008, before the worst of the financial crisis, and it hasn\u2019t been back in that range since then. It sits at 1.6% now. Also, more than $13 trillion of foreign government bonds offer negative yields.\n\nBut as investors move from low-yield bonds into dividend-paying stocks, are they going from the frying pan into the fire?\n\nData from Research Affiliates, Mr. Arnott\u2019s Newport Beach, Calif., investment firm, suggests they may be. The firm calculates that dividend-paying stocks currently are more expensive than they have been over 80% of the time for the past 40 years, based on four ratios\u2014price relative to book value, five-year average earnings, five-year average sales and five-year average dividends. Though the Research Affiliates proprietary U.S. dividend index reached its most overvalued point in late 2011, when the comparison period included the depths of the 2008-09 stock-market crash, it has remained more expensive than its long-term average for much of the period since 2009.\n\nMorningstar Inc. \u2019s market-evaluation tool, meanwhile, finds widespread overvaluation of stocks in several sectors where higher dividends are paid. Morningstar\u2019s aggregate analyses of the utility industry, for instance, recently showed the sector was 7% overvalued. Similarly, the aggregate of Morningstar\u2019s individual stock analyses found real-estate companies, such as mall owners and managers and apartment landlords, to be overpriced by 2% as a group, and consumer companies, such as makers of foods and household products, overpriced by 7% as a group.\n\nMorningstar used a discounted-cash-flow analysis to arrive at these figures, a valuation method that basically forecasts how much cash each business in the group is likely to produce and how much it will cost each company to produce that cash.\n\nHow much can you get paid?\n\nInvestors looking for stocks with comparatively high yields today often find them in big, established companies that sport consistently high returns on invested capital and stable earnings. These often include consumer-products companies, but can also include established tech companies. Top holdings of Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund include Microsoft Corp. , Nike Inc. and Costco Wholesale Corp. The fund currently yields 1.9%.\n\nTrade bonds for dividend stocks? Remember that stocks\u2014even dividend-paying stocks\u2014are a far more volatile investment than bonds. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nOf course, dividend funds that specialize in REITs and utilities do manage to offer slightly higher yields. Companies in those sectors tend to grow slowly and be more capital-intensive than the average company, and thus find it necessary to keep their investors happy with higher-yielding dividends. Vanguard Utilities Index Fund (VUIAX), which has nearly doubled in size from $1.7 billion in late 2013 to $3.2 billion this year, currently offers a yield of 3.1%; iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY), which has 29% of its portfolio in utilities stocks, currently yields over 3%.\n\nRisk vs. return\n\nThe bottom line is investors who chase these yields now do so at the risk of buying into an overheated, overvalued corner of the market. Indeed, the perceived safety of dividends does not extend to the stocks themselves. Declines in a stock\u2019s price can far outstrip the value of its dividend yields. That makes for an investment that loses money overall.\n\nBonds can produce negative total returns too, when interest rates rise. But stocks\u2014even dividend-paying stocks\u2014are a far more volatile investment. And that can make dividend-focused mutual funds a particularly challenging proposition for investors switching into them from bonds.\n\nThe 15-year standard deviation of returns for the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index through July 31 was 3.47%. That means the index\u2019s returns mostly deviated from its average return by 3.47 percentage points. By contrast, the standard deviation of returns of Vanguard Dividend Growth fund over the same period was 12.46%.\n\nAnother concern, whether you\u2019re a short-term or a long-term investor: Though companies are reluctant to do it, they can always cut dividends if profits aren\u2019t high enough to cover them.\n\nCompanies are paying more of their profits as dividends than they have since 2009, according to FactSet data cited by The Wall Street Journal last month. Some may borrow to maintain dividends, if profits aren\u2019t sufficient. But that strategy can self-destruct as more debt is required, since companies must pay interest on debt before they pay dividends to stockholders.\n\nDividend-paying stocks may do better than bonds over the next decade, though not by much. And while they are fine as part of one\u2019s stock allocation, substituting them for bonds and cash can create more portfolio volatility and a smaller return than investors may have bargained for.\n\nMr. Coumarianos, a former Morningstar analyst, is a writer in California.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-q-a-on-paying-for-college-1459735507", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Illustration: Dan Page\n\nReaders\u2019 questions about paying for college continue to flow in. The latest questions focus on Coverdell Education and \u201c529\u201d savings accounts\u2014tax-advantaged vehicles that help families with qualified education expenses.\n\nWe asked experts to help with answers to readers\u2019 questions.\n\nWhat about Coverdell Education Savings Accounts? Are their effects on college financing and taxes the same as 529 accounts?\n\nCoverdells are an often overlooked option to save for college. Money coming out of a Coverdell has the same impact on college financing and taxes as money from 529 accounts. Both accounts are treated as parents\u2019 assets in the financial-aid formula, and proceeds come out tax free if used to pay for college expenses, says Joseph Orsolini, president of College Aid Planners Inc. in Glen Ellyn, Ill.\n\nCoverdells differ slightly from 529s in that contributions to a Coverdell are limited to $2,000 a year. Also, Coverdells can be used for grade-school or high-school expenses, while 529 funds can only be used for college. The funds in a Coverdell also must be used by age 30, otherwise the account is taxed and subject to a 10% penalty, Mr. Orsolini adds.\n\nCan 529 funds be used to pay for an undergraduate degree program at a university outside the U.S.?\n\nYes, but the school has to be a participant in federal Title IV financial-aid programs, says Mr. Orsolini. Check whether a university is on this list by visiting the Education Department\u2019s Federal School Code Search site (select \u201cForeign Country\u201d from the drop-down list for states) or by calling the financial aid hotline, 1-800-4-FEDAID (1-800-433-3243). If a school isn\u2019t eligible for this reason, you can still use 529 funds to pay qualified expenses, but you\u2019ll have to pay tax on any gains you\u2019ve accumulated in your account, Mr. Orsolini says.\n\nCan I use 529 funds to pay for equipment my child\u2019s college officially requires, like a computer? How about equipment needed for a college course but not explicitly required, like a camera for an art class?\n\nComputers are allowed, even if having one isn\u2019t specifically required, says Deborah Fox, who runs the advisory firm Fox College Funding in San Diego. But other equipment qualifies for 529 funds only if the school requires it. For instance, one college journalism school required its students to have an iPhone, so the devices were considered a qualified expense and could be paid with 529 funds. But students in other programs at the same school, where the phones weren\u2019t required, couldn\u2019t use 529 money to pay for them, Mr. Orsolini says.\n\nIf you use 529 funds to pay for something that is not a qualified expense, the earnings portion of that distribution will be taxed as ordinary income and be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty for the year of withdrawal, Ms. Fox says. There are exceptions: \u201cThis penalty may be waived if there are extenuating circumstances, such as the disability or death of the beneficiary, or if the student receives a scholarship, educational assistance for veterans, or other tax-free education moneys that do not come from an inheritance or gift,\u201d she says.\n\nMy brother\u2019s daughter will attend a U.S. college as an international student; she doesn't have a Social Security number, and her parents are also not U.S. citizens. She\u2019ll be studying for four years with a student visa. Is there a way for me to transfer some of my children\u2019s 529 money to their first cousin?\n\nHow to Invest in Real Estate There are a lot of ways to go about real-estate investment. But typically some combination of four options is considered: VIEW Interactive\n\nIt is possible to change beneficiaries as long as the new and old beneficiaries are related. The difficulty is not having a Social Security number: Your niece will need one to own an account, Ms. Fox says.\n\nHave her ask her college whether it will approve her for campus employment, Mr. Orsolini says. \u201cAnyone on a student visa can obtain a Social Security number if they are authorized to work either on or off campus,\u201d he says.\n\nGiven my growing sense that all college loans will be forgiven and that savers are penalized when it comes time to seek tuition assistance, why put money into a 529?\n\nThis is a policy question, and one that depends on politics as much as finance. Although no one can predict what rules politicians will put into place for funding college, it is safe to say that if you are able, you are most likely better off saving for college than relying on the government or on universities to help you out.\n\nThe best way to get aid is based on student merit, which isn\u2019t predicated on family income or assets at all. If you\u2019re seeking need-based aid, 529s are a good vehicle to use, since the aid formula counts only 5.64% of the account balance as available to pay for college each year, Ms. Fox says. These accounts are considered parent-owned assets, which helps you out when schools are figuring out what you can afford to pay, Mr. Orsolini says.\n\nEven if a college does give your child financial aid, not all of that will be grants, meaning that you will have to borrow if you haven\u2019t saved enough, Ms. Fox says. She offers an example: If a school gives a family aid toward 75% of its demonstrated financial need, and 60% of that is in the form of grants, the family will receive $450 of every $1,000 in aid as grants. For every $1,000 the family saved in a 529 account, the student\u2019s financial aid would be reduced by only $56, she says: \u201cMost of the free money awarded remains intact, making it much more advisable to have the 529 plan savings available than not.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re counting on seeking loan forgiveness, note that you or your student will have to make on-time loan payments for 20 or 25 years before you\u2019re eligible for one of these programs, Ms. Fox says. One of her recent-graduate clients, she says, currently owes $210,000 and will have to pay between $170,000 and $369,000 before he qualifies for loan forgiveness\u2014which will only happen if his income remains below $200,000. \u201cThis demonstrates that loan forgiveness can be a lot more expensive than planning ahead and paying for college with money saved,\u201d she says.\n\nAs for wholesale loan forgiveness, it is dangerous to assume that the government will stop requiring student loans to be repaid, Mr. Orsolini says, particularly since students pay so much in interest to the government on their loans that it is a major federal revenue source: \u201cI would not base my college plan on that happening.\u201d\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

The sobering fact: You'll see many once-proud, five-star funds have dropped to four stars, three stars or worse. And there are lessons to be learned from that.\n\nMorningstar, at the request of The Wall Street Journal, produced such a list of the top-rated stock and bond funds and what has become of them. Analysts at the investment-research company found the vast majority of the biggest five-star funds from five and 10 years ago no longer have a top rating.\n\nFor investors, it isn't necessarily terrible if their fund drops a notch; of funds that had a five-star overall rating as of July 2004, 37% had lost one star 10 years later. But 31% lost two stars, 14% dropped three, and 3% lost four. Two of the top-rated funds from 10 years ago, Columbia Marsico International Opportunities Fund and Fairholme Fund, went from having five stars for July 2004 to having just one star and two, respectively, for July 2014. Only 58, or 14%, of the 403 funds that had five stars in July 2004 carried the same rating through July 2014, Morningstar says.\n\nOne encouraging finding: While the 10 largest five-star funds (see chart) may not all have kept their five stars after 10 years\u2014only one did as of July\u2014all outperformed their peers.\n\nStill, a separate study suggests it is even more difficult for a leading fund to stay at the top: S&P Dow Jones Indices analyzed 715 top-performing mutual funds, focusing on U.S.-stock funds for the past four years through March, and found that only two stayed in the top 25% through a four-year period.\n\nA lot of advisers, of course, think everyone should put their money in low-cost index funds because managers can't beat the market over the long term. For those who are looking for more-active managers, though, the Morningstar data offer lots of lessons.\n\nWe asked experts and fund managers to look at the data, and tell us what lessons investors can glean.\n\n1. Don't buy in to the all-powerful manager.\n\nFairholme Fund, once a top five-star performer under a charismatic manager, Bruce Berkowitz, now is down to a two-star rating. Melissa Golden for The Wall Street Journal\n\nSometimes investors are drawn by funds that have a strong presence at the helm. The allure is irresistible: to invest in a fund in which one person calls the shots, especially if the fund is doing particularly well.\n\nDavid Snowball, publisher of the Mutual Fund Observer website, highlights the Marsico and Fairholme funds as examples of funds that were top performers under charismatic managers\u2014 Tom Marsico and Bruce Berkowitz, respectively\u2014and have faltered. \"[Marsico] was a family very much focused on Tom Marsico and his bold take on investing,\" Mr. Snowball says. The same is true of Fairholme, he says, \"which has been struggling in a number of ways lately.\"\n\nMr. Berkowitz couldn't be reached for comment. A spokesperson at Marsico said: \"The investment team is 100% focused on finding unique investment ideas and generating above average investment performance for our clients. One example of our team's progress towards that goal is the Columbia Marsico Global Fund's top 3% ranking in its category over five years.\"\n\n2. High volatility, high returns?\n\nThink again. Many of the top-rated mutual funds in the Morningstar data that have been producing consistent returns actually have low volatility and reduced exposure to risk.\n\nSix of the 10 largest funds with five stars 10 years ago had a 10-year standard deviation less than their category average through July 2014, and three had deviations that were close to their category average, according to the data produced by Morningstar.\n\nHow All the Funds Rank, Then and 10 Years Later View a table of five-star mutual funds from 10 years ago, sorted by size, and their July 2014 ratings.\n\nAs many as 19% of the 58 funds that retained a five-star rating over a 10-year period, including through the financial crisis, were in the conservative- and moderate-risk-allocation categories. One such fund is Vanguard Wellesley Income, a conservative-allocation fund that also grew throughout that time to more than $38 billion in assets from nearly $10 billion.\n\n\"Every conservative-allocation fund [in the Morningstar data] remains a good investment today,\" says Mr. Snowball. Sometimes being boring pays.\n\n3. Watch for growing pains.\n\nSome mutual funds aren't good at adapting their strategy to their growth, says Russel Kinnel, director of fund research at Morningstar.\n\nAs investors move their cash to successful funds, the managers have to figure out how to invest the money. Some can feel they need to invest it quickly, which could cause the manager to make the wrong investment.\n\nMr. Kinnel highlights Thornburg International Value, a fund that has gone from managing assets of $2.1 billion at the end of 2004 to more than $18 billion at the end of 2007\u2014and has seen its five-star rating drop to a two.\n\n\"They've had tremendous success, but they've gotten too big and that has impacted the performance,\" says Mr. Kinnel.\n\nBill Fries, the fund's co-manager, says getting bigger hasn't caused the trouble.\n\n\"I would concede, it is easier to manage a small portfolio than a large portfolio,\" he says. \"Our performance over the past year and a half has been more about not being in the right place at the best time,\" he says, meaning not making the right bet on European stocks when the region began to recover.\n\nHe says he believes the fund has turned a corner.\n\n4. Keep it simple.\n\n\"We live in a financial world that idolizes complexity,\" says Manisha Thakor, who runs MoneyZen Wealth Management in Santa Fe, N.M. But don't be impressed by fancy jargon. She says some top-performing funds \"are so clearly articulated, your 12-year-old child can understand the root logic.\"\n\nShe highlights Dimensional Fund Advisors' U.S. Core Equity 1 Portfolio, which has more than tripled in size and gone from a three-star Morningstar rating to a five.\n\n\"This fund's simple, powerful strategy is to own a broad range of U.S. companies with a tilt toward two dimensions\u2014small and value companies\u2014that have historically provided higher expected returns,\" she says.\n\n\"Turnover is low, at 2%, making the fund index-like,\" Ms. Thakor says, in the way it buys and holds shares for the long run.\n\n5. Old-fashioned is still OK.\n\nWill Danoff, famous for his piles of financial reports and jotted notes, has been the manager of giant Fidelity Contrafund for the past 24 years. The fund, with more than $106 billion in assets, has retained a consistently solid star rating over the decade, dropping a notch from a five to a four.\n\nWhen it comes to taking a new position in a firm, \"we discuss with the companies the fundamentals [of their business],\" says Mr. Danoff. \"The more companies you listen to, the more opportunities you see. Woody Allen says 80% of life is showing up. I am the Woody Allen of Fidelity.\"\n\n6. Get the right 'balance.'\n\nFunds with a balanced portfolio between bonds and stocks tend to retain steady ratings over time and can serve as \"one-stop\" shops for investors.\n\nOf the 10 largest funds that kept their five stars for 10 years, three were balanced funds, according to an analysis by Mutual Fund Observer. And one of these success stories is Vanguard Wellington, which kept a ratio of roughly 60/40 between stocks and bonds as assets under management grew.\n\nThe other two balanced funds to make this group were American Funds Income Fund of America and American Funds American Balanced.\n\nTodd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual-fund research at McGraw Hill Financial Inc. 's S&P Capital IQ in New York, says there is a growing interest in balanced asset-allocation funds, such as Vanguard's fund, but warns that these funds have \"a somewhat different risk profile\" because of their varying degrees of exposure to bonds or stocks.\n\n\"More stocks tends to be higher-risk than less stocks. But also look inside at the type of stocks and bonds,\" says Mr. Rosenbluth.\n\nModeration seems to have paid off.\n\n7. Look forward.\n\nWhen a fund drops a notch, it doesn't necessarily mean it hasn't performed well. There are other factors to consider.\n\nMorningstar points out that a fund's star rating can change because of new categories, new funds being added to the category, funds changing categories and such. Overall ratings are a weighted average of the three-, five- and 10-year ratings.\n\nScott Clemons, chief investment strategist of private banking at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, emphasizes that ratings are backward-looking and say little about what will happen next.\n\nThe same can be said of recent returns. In the S&P Dow Jones study, an investor browsing at random through the 700-plus top-performing funds would have had less than a 1% chance of picking one of the two funds that was still in the top quartile four years later. (For the curious, the two were AMG SouthernSun Small Cap and Hodges Small Cap. ) The study included no index-tracking funds, exchange-traded funds, or specialized sector funds. S&P Dow Jones Indices is a unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc.\n\nNevertheless, there are a few helpful questions investors can ask when looking at past performance, says Mr. Clemons. Among these: Is the same management team in place? How was the track record built? And if a fund had a great year, was it the result of \"a lucky bet\" or \"a sign of some underlying strength?\"\n\nMr. Espinoza is a London-based reporter for The Wall Street Journal.

Here are the experts\u2019 answers to some of the letters.\n\nMy daughter plans on living off campus for a couple of years. Can the money in a 529 account be used for these room and board expenses?\n\nYes, money in 529 college-savings accounts can pay for off-campus housing, but only if the costs don\u2019t exceed what the school charges for room and board, says Kimberly Foss, founder and president of Empyrion Wealth Management in Roseville, Calif. This applies only to students enrolled half-time or more, Ms. Foss says: \u201cYou cannot pay for the cost of an off-campus apartment with your 529 funds if your child is taking just one course or not enrolled at all for a particular semester.\u201d\n\nColleges can change their housing fees from year to year, so be sure to check the school\u2019s room and board costs each academic year before telling your daughter she can live off campus, says Deana Arnett, a financial planner at Rosenthal Wealth Management Group in Manassas, Va.\n\nWe have approximately $75,000 in a 529 account for our son, who\u2019s a junior in high school. Although our income precludes us from Fafsa aid [federal student aid], we are hoping our son will receive some merit-based grants. Our accountant has suggested that we withdraw only one-quarter of the funds in the 529 each year, so that we will still be earning interest on the balance. Is this the best strategy? How will this impact any other tuition assistance we apply for?\n\nDon\u2019t completely write off your ability to get some financial aid at some point in your son\u2019s college career, and think about how that might affect your 529 withdrawal strategy, says Ms. Foss.\n\nConsider whether you\u2019ll have a low-income or high-expense year while your son is in college\u2014perhaps because you\u2019ll have two children in college at the same time, she says. If, for instance, you see such a year coming when your son will be a junior, she says: \u201cWhy not spend down the 529 in the first two years to give you a greater chance at aid in year three?\u201d\n\nSchools that award merit aid may ask families to fill out a CSS Profile form, which looks at 529s along with a family\u2019s other financial resources. Ms. Foss suggests calling the schools directly and asking how they factor in 529 funds when making aid decisions.\n\nIf my income qualifies me to contribute to a Coverdell education-savings account, what\u2019s the smartest way to split my contributions between a Coverdell and a 529 if I want to save for my children\u2019s college education? Can I contribute to both in the same year?\n\nYou can contribute to both. Each student can receive no more than $2,000 in Coverdell accounts annually. So some parents put the first $2,000 in a Coverdell and then save in a 529, where the contribution limits are much higher, Ms. Foss says.\n\nSome things to consider when deciding how to split your contributions: Coverdell funds can be used for private elementary or high schools, as well as college. And you can invest the money in a Coverdell account in stocks, bonds, mutual funds or ETFs of your choice rather than selecting from a 529 plan\u2019s menu, allowing you more investment options and potentially lower fees than investments in a 529 account.\n\nWhile it is possible to set up a Coverdell as a student-owned account, Coverdells are best set up as parent-owned accounts with the child as the beneficiary. Under this setup, students don\u2019t get control at age 18 as they might if the account is student-owned. In any case, funds must be distributed to the beneficiary by age 30. Also, calculations for college financial aid count a Coverdell, whether owned by a dependent student or parent-owned, at up to 5.64% of the amount in the account (the same as a 529).\n\nHaving a student-owned Coverdell become the child\u2019s property at age 18 means you no longer have any say about how the money is spent. \u201cThat\u2019s something that can stop parents dead in their well-intentioned college-savings tracks\u2014you could think you are saving for college and end up funding a car or a vacation,\u201d Ms. Foss says.\n\nA lower income in retirement could help boost financial aid. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nCoverdells also have an age limit of 18 for contributions, while 529s don\u2019t have any limit, Ms. Arnett says. She says parents also should consider whether they\u2019ll be paying for private school before college or for college only, whether their state offers tax deductions for Coverdells or 529s and whether they would be better off buying into their state\u2019s prepaid college-tuition plan and locking in today\u2019s tuition costs.\n\nDo colleges take retirement into account when they figure required parental contributions? Would retiring a year or two early, before our child starts college, help reduce the required parental contribution? We\u2019ve saved a few years\u2019 worth of college expenses in a 529 for our child and will enter retirement with a portfolio heavily weighted in IRAs, 401(k)s and 401(k) Roths.\n\nThere is no formal question on the Fafsa application about whether parents are retired, but colleges do take family income and assets into account, so a lower income in retirement could help boost aid. On the asset side, they can\u2019t force you to spend down retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs, but they do consider nonretirement assets such as brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, money-market investments and regular savings accounts when making aid calculations, Ms. Arnett says.\n\nYou will have to make a determination about whether the chance of more aid outweighs the risks of early retirement. Don\u2019t assume that\u2019s a trade-off you should make, says Ms. Foss: \u201cAssuming you enjoy your work and are making a good living, why leave a job on the simple premise that retirement will help boost federal aid for college?\u201d\n\nThink about whether you\u2019re ready to make this transition, and whether you\u2019d be able to get another job if it turns out your retirement didn\u2019t increase your child\u2019s aid enough to cover college costs and you need additional income.\n\nBe aware that mandatory distributions from your retirement accounts, if you are old enough to have to withdraw money from them, will go into the formula. And colleges might look at whether you are overfunding your retirement accounts and factor your contributions into your student\u2019s aid calculations.\n\n\u201cColleges can view \u2018excess\u2019 retirement contributions as discretionary income, especially when assessing eligibility for their own scholarships, throwing a wrench in your plans to qualify for more aid,\u201d Ms. Foss says.\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

Five years ago, they expected it to gain 10% annually over a 20-year period.\n\n\"Save a little more, because the returns are just not going to be there,\" says Mr. Miller, chief investment officer at Frontier Asset Management LLC.

VIEW Interactive\n\nThere is no way to get the money out of a 529 without paying penalties on the earnings portion unless you use it for qualified educational expenses. The only option is to change the beneficiary to another eligible family member who can then use the money for educational purposes.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to pay the taxes and penalties, you can retitle the account with one of your students as the owner as well as beneficiary. This allows you to \u201cdistribute to them in their probable lower tax bracket to minimize the taxes and penalties if there is not a compelling reason to continue the 529 plan,\u201d says Beth Walker, a partner at Wealth Consulting Group, a Las Vegas financial-planning firm. You also have the option to move the funds back into your own retirement savings, but that will also incur taxes and penalties, says Gretchen Cliburn, director of financial planning at BKD Wealth Advisors in Springfield, Mo.\n\nAfter my daughters graduated from college, I began working for health-care nonprofits overseas. I can\u2019t pay my daughters\u2019 leftover college bills on my current income, and I\u2019m approaching retirement. Can I get the bills reduced based on my circumstances?\n\nIt depends on how the bills are structured, Ms. Walker says. If what you owe is a Parent Plus loan in your own name, you have several options, she says. You can adopt an income-contingent Parent Plus loan-repayment plan, which will lower your monthly payment and make you eligible for loan forgiveness after 25 years of payments.\n\n\u201cThis will likely increase the total interest charged over the life of the loan but may make payments manageable from a monthly cash-flow perspective,\u201d she says.\n\nIf you qualify based on credit and income, you could also consolidate and refinance your loan, which will decrease your interest rate. Or you could try to get into the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which would forgive your loan in 10 years, assuming your job qualifies you, she says.\n\nMy son\u2019s wife works for a major university. Because of her employment, she is entitled to tuition-free education for her children. Included on her W-2 is the cost of that tuition, which is taxable to her. Can she use money from a 529 plan to pay the taxes generated by the tuition inclusion on her W-2?\n\nSince taxes paid on an employee benefit\u2014such as a tuition discount\u2014aren\u2019t considered a qualified education expense, you would have to pay taxes and penalties on the earnings portion of 529 money used to pay those taxes, Ms. Walker says.\n\nBut if you had little or no gain on the money that you have contributed to your 529, \u201cit might still make sense to meet your tax liability with money that is sitting in the 529,\u201d she says.\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

Or, instead, should we keep the money where it is, in a bank account earmarked for her after she finishes college? The account is in my name and she is the sole beneficiary.\n\nRetirement assets are generally not included as part of the Fafsa (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) and financial-aid calculation, says Thomas Morgan, director of 529 programs for BlackRock \u2019s U.S. wealth advisory business. \u201cAdditionally, if she is not considered a dependent for Fafsa purposes, and the decision is to continue to hold the assets in your bank account, not hers, it also then would not be included in her Fafsa calculation.\u201d\n\nDue in part to merit scholarships, we may have more 529 funds than we need for my children. I may leave some for future grandchildren, but how can I withdraw funds penalty-free for nontuition purposes?\n\nYou have three options, says Beth Walker, partner at Wealth Consulting Group, in Las Vegas: Use the funds for graduate school; switch the beneficiary to a qualifying family member; or take the funds out and pay only the income taxes on your earnings (but not on your original contributions, which were after-tax dollars). When offsetting a scholarship, the 10% penalty is waived, Ms. Walker says.\n\nMy 24-year-old (no longer a dependent on our taxes) is thinking of returning to school. We still have a little money in a 529 account for her. Will that be counted against her when she files the Fafsa?\n\nIf you withdraw funds from your 529 for your daughter\u2019s qualified educational expenses, that money will be considered part of her income for Fafsa purposes, says Mr. Morgan. That, \u201cby itself, would result in less aid awarded the subsequent year,\u201d he says.\n\nIf you don\u2019t use a 529 for education and the owner closes the account, how is it taxed? Is the 10% penalty on the gain only? If you transfer some to another grandchild and take out the rest, how is the portion you keep taxed?\n\nThe owner may change the beneficiary to any eligible family member, says Gretchen Cliburn, director of financial planning at BKD Wealth Advisors in Springfield, Mo. But if nonqualified withdrawals are made, the earnings\u2014generally not the contributions, which are after tax\u2014will incur federal and state income taxes and a 10% penalty. If contributions were deducted on a state income-tax return, \u201cyou also will generally have to report additional state \u2018recapture\u2019 income,\u201d says Ms. Walker.\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

Richard Allen for The wall Street Journal\n\nA famous yoga instructor wrote that \u201cbalance is the aim of all living creatures.\u201d After I retired, I was getting ready for my first yoga class, and I lost my balance putting one leg into my underpants. The resulting hamstring injury derailed my postretirement assault on inner peace.\n\nRather than hobbling, I purchased a sparkly, day-glow-purple cane. My thought was that a slick fashion choice would make me appear vital. But when it came time to actually stroll outside with it, a glimpse in the mirror revealed that rather than the expected vision of an aging hipster, I looked like an aging buffoon.\n\nI ditched the cane in favor of not walking so much.\n\nYou have to understand: I\u2019m very cool. I always have been. In the \u201960s, instead of the administration building, I led the takeover of the girls\u2019 gym. In the \u201970s, I bartended at the coolest East Side singles\u2019 bars and told patrons that whatever I served them was Hemingway\u2019s favorite.\n\nI have always been sure that I am not going to be like one really old guy I knew as a child, who, each time he fell, would begin assuring those around him, \u201cI\u2019m all right, I\u2019m OK,\u201d as he continued to lie on the ground. That guy was a different species.\n\nMy dilemma is that with my 70s fast approaching, being cool is getting harder and harder to pull off. It\u2019s dawning on me (way too slowly) that it\u2019s a delicate balancing act to both accept aging and still try to somehow look cool. And, as we know, balance is not my strong suit.\n\nThe result is that in my sometimes absurd efforts to stay cool, I\u2019m often finding I couldn\u2019t be less so.\n\nDoctor\u2019s advice\n\nConsider the time recently when I was blindsided by some spinal issues. I sought out the advice of a highly regarded back sage in Manhattan. The visit was expensive and brief. I wasn\u2019t even sure if he examined my MRIs. After he directed me to stretch, twist and turn, he nodded his head with a grim smile. Nothing surprising here, he told me. A common condition of a long life\u2019s journey. Follow his instructions and all would be well.\n\nHis instructions: Never carry your own luggage; never go out in the rain; never go out in the snow; never turn your head; always turn your body using your feet. My only consolation was that he didn\u2019t forbid me to play air guitar.\n\nI said, \u201cYou\u2019re telling me to act old.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must,\u201d he said, leaving the \u201cYou are old\u201d unspoken. After the appointment, I planned on driving back home, normally a four-hour drive. \u201cOn your drive home,\u201d he advised, \u201cyou must stop at least three times for no less than 20 minutes each. Have a cup of coffee\u2026or tea! So it takes you six hours. Relax.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve never been accused of being passive-aggressive, but I got home in three hours, nonstop. As the miles popped by, I remembered that when I was 20, I drove across the whole country in less than three days. Surely, I still have what it takes.\n\nI won\u2019t bore you with descriptions of my reduced walking capabilities during the next several weeks. But my pain did force me to an epiphany: In 50 years, I had progressed from foolhardy to abject stupidity.\n\nThe super-large, wide-load sunglasses given to the author after cataract surgery did not cause anyone to mistake him for \u201cthe man in the Foster Grants.\u201d Photo: John Buskin\n\nMy children don\u2019t have a lot of patience for my obsession with looking cool. Concerned that my mountain-goat agility while hiking was losing its edge, my daughter presented me with a pair of new, fire-red \u201ctrekking poles.\u201d Initially, I thought these shiny, state-of-the-art accouterments would announce to fellow hikers that I was the second coming of Daniel Boone. A brief examination of fellow hikers sporting similar poles quickly showed, however, that they were the preferred fashion accessory of the marginally ambulatory. Going up a path with them felt like negotiating the Appalachian Trail with a walker.\n\nThe poles went the way of the cane, as did most of my hiking. I still hike once in a while, but now I call it walking and stay on level ground. Or I embrace what I like to call \u201cspiritual stillness,\u201d or what others might call sitting.\n\nWhen my children caught me using an old towel to wipe frost off the outside of the windshield (while driving), they browbeat me into trading in my defroster-challenged, 2001 slick, black sedan. I had a vision of a British racing-green Austin-Healey. But a double overhead cam engine, independent suspension and the keen magic of double clutching weren\u2019t to be mine. My daughter courteously pointed out that ancient sports cars weren\u2019t practical. Pretty much for the same reasons we refused to buy her a live monkey when she was 7: It was dangerous and she wouldn\u2019t have a clue what to do with it.\n\nI ended up with a small, safe, four-wheel-drive. But I refused to surrender entirely: I got a standard transmission. The only problem is that when I slip the stick into a new gear and try to work the pedals with my patented panache, I sometimes stall. Very uncool.\n\nTwo other things I didn\u2019t anticipate: First, in order to appear appropriately slick and casual, I keep the seat pretty far back. But I guess I\u2019ve gotten a little shorter. Pushing the seat up to where I can completely depress the clutch makes me look like a 6-year-old in a bumper car. I refuse.\n\nSecond, ailments like sciatica and stenosis can make one\u2019s feet numb at times. So\u2014to be on the safe side\u2014I employ my hips and torso without bending anything. I call it the \u201cgoose-step gear shift.\u201d\n\nThe strategy entails driving 5 or 10 mph slower than the speed limit and then turning on cruise control, eliminating the need to shift. Second or third gear work pretty well for this method, though because of my slow progress, the drivers stack up behind me, threatening mayhem when they finally pass. Needless to say, they don\u2019t exactly consider me cool, despite the fact I\u2019m driving a stick shift.\n\nMy children were also a little concerned when I demonstrated my shortcut to the parking lot that entailed vaulting over a back fence. For some reason\u2014as they were helping me off the blacktop\u2014they wouldn\u2019t believe that I had never before fallen like that, scraping the palms of both hands.\n\nStill, it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t made allowances. I\u2019ve given up carrying kayaks over my head solo, and faced the harsh reality that I\u2019ll never be a Navy SEAL.\n\nCataracts of denial\n\nI also got an eye test. That\u2019s how I ended up getting cataract surgery.\n\nThere just isn\u2019t any youthfully flippant behavior to display your inherent coolness to the cataract gang. The waiting room isn\u2019t a place to find another schoolyard basketball player to make the sides even.\n\nIn the little \u201cgift bag\u201d the doctors supply\u2014in addition to three different medicines and assorted eye drops\u2014was a pair of large, black, wraparound sunglasses. Now I could slip them on under the brim of my hat, and over my Coke-bottle bifocals. Strolling around town in my cap and shades was chill! My girlfriend even posted a picture of my \u201cbad self\u201d on her Facebook page.\n\nThe social-media response made it clear that in these shades, nobody mistook me for \u201cthe man in the Foster Grants.\u201d Apparently, these super-large,wide-load sunglasses identify the wearer as a wizened geezer with his pants belted above his nipples. Now, there I was in all my uncool glory for the world to see.\n\nI was recently in a doctor\u2019s waiting room. It was a long wait and I didn\u2019t realize that one of my legs was asleep. When they called my name and I started to rise, the leg that was asleep\u2014actually numb\u2014wouldn\u2019t hold my weight and I fell. As a nurse emerged from somewhere with a wheelchair, I heard myself say, \u201cI\u2019m all right. I\u2019m OK,\u201d as I started to rise. The nurse gave me a dirty look, probably fed up with old macho guys in denial. So I looked up at her, smiled, and added, \u201cI\u2019m cool.\u201d\n\nMr. Buskin is retired and lives in upstate New York.

In \u201cLife Reimagined: The Science, Art and Opportunity of Midlife,\u201d Ms. Hagerty chronicles how she seized these crises as a chance to redefine herself and re-envision what might come next.\n\nShe shares in detail the mental and physical challenges of tackling a new career, and allows us to mourn our own losses and regrets as she reviews and invests with new meaning lessons gleaned from her mother\u2019s resilient spirit. Ms. Hagerty\u2019s account of her transformation is laced with the latest research into healthy aging from the fields of neuroscience, psychology, physiology and sociology, and includes numerous interviews. At one point she makes a case for what she calls \u201cintentional frivolity.\u201d Three cheers to that!\n\nDiary of the year\n\nIs turning 60 \u201cthe beginning of the end, or the end of the beginning?\u201d Author Ian Brown asks all of the right questions in \u201cSixty: A Diary of My Sixty-First Year,\u201d an account that is by turns witty and poignant. I laughed aloud as Mr. Brown recounts losses of hair, lapses of memory and regrets (the long-promised novel he still hasn\u2019t written). With a wry touch, he admits to forebodings of mortality, confessing, \u201cI spend an embarrassing amount of time every single day thinking about who is younger than me, and who is older.\u201d He waxes existential at times, sometimes too much so. But he also knows how to keep it light: While discussing how he should spend whatever time he has left, he admits he should have thought more about this when he was 20 and still frittering it away.\n\nMr. Brown, a Canadian, is grateful for his happy marriage of 26 years and humble in the face of his children (one of whom was born severely disabled). He is also acutely aware, perhaps due to a tendency toward the curmudgeonly, of the person he doesn't want to become\u2014\u201cthe cranky old man.\u201d The challenge, he writes, is \u201cstaying open.\u201d As for the benefits of observing and recording one\u2019s life day by day in a diary: \u201cSomeone ought to keep his eyes open,\u201d he concludes. \u201cOtherwise, you could miss a lot along the way.\u201d\n\nAn all-American milestone birthday\n\nThis centenary year of the National Park Service is the perfect moment for \u201cA Thinking Person\u2019s Guide to America\u2019s National Parks.\u201d Edited by Robert Manning and others, the essays and often breathtaking photographs in this volume expertly examine the more than 400 sites of natural beauty and historic importance that make up the national park system. Readers will find plenty of reasons to visit some places again and to discover others. As I turned the pages, I relived my explorations of the Ancestral Pueblo cliff dwellings at Mesa Verde in Colorado, my awe at witnessing the geological wonders of Yellowstone and Yosemite, and the weight of history I felt at Harpers Ferry and at Gettysburg. My quandary now: What to see next.\n\n\u2018I spend an embarrassing amount of time every single day thinking about who is younger than me, and who is older.\u2019 \u2014Ian Brown, \u201cSixty: A Diary of My Sixty-First Year\u201d\n\nRelive the decade that looms so large\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this article, chances are that you lived through at least part of the drama-filled 1960s. Whether you were too young then to understand the era\u2019s complexities, or old enough to want to revisit or clarify what really happened, you\u2019ll find plenty to contemplate in \u201cThe 60s: The Story of a Decade,\u201d from the New Yorker. An anthology as captivating as it is comprehensive (about 700 pages), this book brings the era back to life through a wide-ranging selection of pieces that appeared in the magazine during those years.\n\nAs I read now-classic essays by Rachel Carson and James Baldwin, I was struck by how timely they remain. Contemporary reports on the assassinations of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., the Vietnam War and Israel\u2019s Six-Day War brought the era back as vividly as a newsreel. Roger Angell \u2019s piece on the New York Mets\u2019 astonishing 1969 World Series victory made me shed tears anew over my hometown Baltimore Orioles.\n\nMuch more fun, for me, were the arts pieces that introduced New Yorker readers to such talents as the Beatles and Bob Dylan. Among my other favorite pieces: Pauline Kael on the movies, fiction by John Updike and John Cheever, and poetry by Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. Adding to the mix, current New Yorker writers such as Malcolm Gladwell reintroduce readers to staff writers who were their predecessors.\n\nThe keys to balanced health\u2026\n\n\u201cWe are often led to believe that aging is something that simply happens,\u201d begins Mark E. Williams in \u201cThe Art and Science of Aging Well: A Physician\u2019s Guide to a Healthy Body, Mind and Spirit.\u201d Dr. Williams, in this information-packed overview, both encourages us and shows us how to make ourselves as fit, and the years ahead as fulfilling, as possible. \u201cDoes memory have to decline with aging?\u201d he asks. \u201cAbsolutely not! Like anything else, the more you neglect memory, the worse it gets.\u201d\n\nHis prescription: Enriching mind and body through lifelong learning, exercise and new experiences, such as travel, volunteering, teaching, mentoring and participation in your extended community of friends and family. Such activities, he says, stimulate the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a substance that helps preserve one\u2019s memory by encouraging nerve cells to grow and connect. His philosophy is at once realistic and positive. \u201cOld age is no refuge from an empty life,\u201d he writes. He points to the ways you can make it both full and fulfilling.\n\n\u2026and balancing the medical bills\n\nHow do you pay your medical bills? Or, more to the point, how do you get your health insurance to pay? That is the subject of Frank Lalli \u2019s invaluable guide, \u201cYour Best Health Care Now: Get Doctor Discounts, Save with Better Health Insurance, Find Affordable Prescriptions.\u201d An esteemed journalist and editor, Mr. Lalli eight years ago was diagnosed with cancer. Fortunately, effective treatment was available; unfortunately, the price tag for his wonder drugs was $204,000 a year. Determined to find a better resolution, he became a self-styled \u201chealth detective,\u201d using his considerable skills as an investigative reporter to track down ways to lower his bills. He succeeded by doing what he instructs his readers to do: asking questions.\n\nChapter by chapter, he details how to find the best insurance policy, depending on your situation; explains what you need to know about Medicare and the Affordable Care Act; and provides specific tips for cutting red tape and getting the best health care you can. There\u2019s preventive advice, too: Have a full physical each year, Mr. Lalli says, to build a baseline of knowledge about who you are and to establish mutual trust with your doctor before an emergency strikes.\n\nMs. Cole is a writer in New York.

Photo: Jim Santos\n\nJust four years ago, taking an early retirement on a Pacific beach in South America was not part of my plans. Yet here I am, 58 years old, retired and living happily with my wife, Rita, on the southern coast of Ecuador.\n\nWe are living healthier lifestyles at a fraction of our previous expenses, and best of all\u2014our retirement nest eggs remain untouched.\n\nWhen we first started looking at Ecuador, it was mostly as a place to escape East Coast winters. We were based in Maryland at the time but could work anywhere that had internet and cellphone service, so we traveled a lot. Every place we went\u2014Hawaii, the Caribbean, Italy\u2014we played the \u201ccould we live here\u201d game. But there was always something that just did not fit.\n\nEcuador began to grow on us practically from the moment we arrived, on an exploratory trip in February 2013. We were drawn to Salinas, a coastal resort city on the Santa Elena peninsula. The climate here is moderate year round. The Humboldt current brings cool breezes and an abundance of sea life. Temperatures rarely exceed 90 degrees, or drop below 70.\n\nEcuador uses the U.S. dollar for currency, and the constitution guarantees foreigners the same property rights as citizens. We also liked that it is in the same time zone as the Eastern U.S., which, at the time, made it easy to conduct business remotely.\n\nThe clincher came when we started looking at property prices. Good-quality beachfront condos with three or four bedrooms in Salinas were available for less than $250,000. Single-family homes of the same size just a block or two from the Pacific Ocean were listed between $175,000 and $200,000.\n\niStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nBy the second month after our arrival, we had purchased a four-bedroom, four-bath condo in a modern oceanfront high-rise with great amenities, security and 24/7 staff for just $220,000. And within weeks, we had stopped thinking of Salinas as a winter getaway and started considering it our new home.\n\nLiving here has brought some profound changes. After a year and a half, our expenses had dropped so much that there was no reason for me to continue in my job as a computer/network professional. Our living expenses averaged $1,500 a month, compared with $6,000 when we lived in the U.S.\n\nI support myself now as a freelance writer, not because we need the income, but because I enjoy doing it. We have no car, no mortgage and pay less than $300 a year in property taxes. We earn some income from a house we continue to own in the U.S. But not only are we not touching my 401(K) or our IRAs\u2014we can still afford to contribute to them.\n\nFoot traffic\n\nWe walk to the bank, market, restaurants and convenience stores. In fact, we spend most of our lives in the fresh air, as restaurants have outdoor seating, our mercados (fresh produce, fish and meat markets) are open-air, and shops tend to set their merchandise out on the sidewalks as well. For longer trips, an excellent bus system will get us anywhere in the peninsula for 30 cents (15 cents for those over 65 years old), and cabs charge $2 or $3 to most of the places we need to reach.\n\nIn addition to fresh seafood, we are blessed with a year-round growing season. Our local mercado daily features a bounty of fresh fruits and vegetables priced so low that between the two of us, we cannot carry home more than $20 worth of groceries. Fresh eggs, dairy products, chicken, pork and beef (all raised without steroids) are also to be found there.\n\nEvenings, we enjoy getting together in small groups with our expat and Ecuadorean friends for dinner and conversation. There is an active and growing expat community in Salinas and the neighboring towns. There are expat bars and restaurants, poker nights, book clubs, groups that do charity work, and so on. Rita and I are part of a small subset that try to live more like the locals.\n\niStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nSo far we\u2019ve been very pleased with the health-care system. If your health is generally good, fees for most services are so low you may opt\u2014as we have\u2014to pay for health care on an as-needed basis. A visit to the doctor\u2019s office runs between $20 and $60. Last year, I had arthroscopic shoulder surgery in nearby Guayaquil, Ecuador\u2019s largest city, at the Hospital Cl\u00ednica Kennedy, a fully equipped, modern hospital\u2014one of the best in Ecuador. My total costs for the procedure, which included consultations and follow-up visits, sonogram, MRI, X-rays, cardiogram, fees for two surgeons, an anesthesiologist and an overnight hospital stay: $6,000.\n\nA state-sponsored health plan available to Ecuadoreans and expats alike costs less than $80 a month for a married couple. Under this plan, care is free if you use the state-sponsored hospitals and clinics. But this can mean longer waits for an appointment, little choice in doctors, and less-modern facilities. Private health-insurance plans offer more flexibility for $200 to $500 a month for a married couple. But if you are over 65, most of these private insurers will not cover you.\n\nBottled water\n\nNothing is perfect, and Ecuador is no exception. Expats usually must stick to bottled water, and we wash our produce and meats in antibacterial wash before eating. You also don\u2019t have to travel far to get to villages where you will see pigs and goats looking for food along the mostly dirt roads.\n\nMany shops in Ecuador display their merchandise on the street. Photo: Jim Santos\n\nBe willing to learn some Spanish, and to roll with the differences in lifestyles. We have found that Ecuadoreans generally are not too concerned with punctuality, for example. Working with the local utility companies can be time-consuming and frustrating, as any change involves a personal visit or three.But our impression is that many people here love to celebrate life, and do so loudly. During high season in Salinas it is not uncommon to hear music and parties all night long.\n\nFor us, the best part of living here is the adventure of travel. We have taken several road trips, armed only with shaky GPS maps and our even shakier Spanish. Everywhere we go, from the fish markets of Manta on the coast to the capital city of Quito, high in the Andes, the people are friendly.\n\nSoon, we will be adding the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands to our list of great Ecuadorean destinations. There is more of South America we want to see as well. We are walking 50 miles or more a week to get in shape for a trip next year to Cusco, Peru. There we will hike the Inca Trail to the fabled ancient ruins of Machu Picchu, considered by many to be one of the Seven Wonders of the World.\n\nMr. Santos is a writer in Salinas, Ecuador.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-use-online-games-and-activities-to-connect-to-grandchildren-1480302541", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "One way to get closer to grandchildren is to meet them on their own turf, online, enaging in multiplayer games like \u2018Minecraft,\u2019 for example. Photo: Minecraft\n\nWhen it comes to grandparents and grandchildren, technology can be a double-edged sword.\n\nFor some grandparents, it can be a barrier to communication, a foreign language that seems too daunting to learn and understand. But for those willing to take the leap, technology can be a bridge between grandparents and grandchildren, allowing them to forge a daily connection that was impossible in previous generations.\n\nSimply asking your grandchildren about their online activities can be a great start\u2014an opening to a whole new set of conversations and shared experiences. The trick is to find things at the intersection of your grandchildren\u2019s online passions and your own hobbies or interests. That is easier when you know what some of the options are:\n\n\u201cMinecraft\u201d: This online game of building and exploring fantasy worlds is hugely popular with children. If your grandchildren are playing it already, playing together can be a great way to connect, however far away you live.\n\nWhile there are lots of activities involved that feel like competitive videogames, I found it easiest to get started in \u201ccreative mode,\u201d which allows players to build virtual homes or castles out of blocks that work like big on-screen Lego bricks.\n\nIt costs about $27 to buy a copy of \u201cMinecraft\u201d you can play on your computer, but once you\u2019ve done that, you can make online dates to play with the grandchildren even if you\u2019re in different locations.\n\nYou can ask them to suggest activities within the game that you\u2019ll both enjoy. You might like competing with timed challenges, where you and the grandchildren will have a few minutes to build a giant cow or a virtual train. Or help them out on their own favorite project, adding rooms to their palace, or extending a treehouse.\n\nWhat really matters is learning enough about the game to understand the children\u2019s obsession, and having the opportunity to chat\u2014\u201cMinecraft\u201d has its own text chat system\u2014while you play.\n\nGenealogy: For genealogy enthusiasts, working on the family tree can introduce grandchildren to their ancestral history. On some websites, like Geni and Ancestry.com, multiple family members can collaborate. Ask the grandchildren to fill in details on the immediate family, or encourage them to research an ancestor who interests them. You can get younger children interested in family history by introducing them to an app like Little Family Tree. With older children, share the results of what you\u2019ve already learned about your genealogy. My big sister is a genealogist and a new grandmother: She plans to use the \u201cZap the Grandma Gap\u201d books to introduce her grandchildren to genealogy. Later she plans to ask them to join her on Ancestry.com.\n\n\u2018Many online games have a chat function, and so give you a way of exchanging short messages along with your game play.\u2019\n\nInternet memes: These are typically funny images or short videos, which spread among teens and tweens like wildfire. Even children too young to read can enjoy cute animal videos, and if you become the hip grandparent who includes amusing videos and images in your emails, you\u2019ll never have to worry about your emails lingering unread in their inbox. As your grandchildren get older, they may delight in sending you their latest online finds, too.\n\nSocial media: Following your grandchildren on social media can be a great way of keeping up with their day-to-day lives. But be sure to ask whether they want you to follow them, and if yes, on which platforms. While Facebook is still the most-used social network for both adults and teens, your grandchildren might enjoy having you follow their photography on Instagram or their videos on YouTube\u2014especially if you show them how much they matter to you by liking or commenting on their posts.\n\nIf Facebook is the way they want to keep in touch, you don\u2019t have to post your own news on Facebook at large: You can create a private Facebook group for immediate family. It is a way of exchanging your latest news without all of Facebook being privy to the conversation. In addition to bringing you closer to your grandchildren, you\u2019ll be helping them stay in touch with their cousins and extended family.\n\nOnline games: Games such as \u201cDraw Something\u201d and \u201cWords With Friends\u201d are popular among adults and children. Even children who are barely reading can enjoy the mobile versions of multiplayer games like \u201cTicket To Ride\u201d and \u201cCarcassonne.\u201d Many have a chat function, and so give you a way of exchanging short messages along with your game play. The latest iPhone messaging app places such games within text messaging, which can be a good way of inserting yourself into grandchildren\u2019s texting habits. You\u2019re much more likely to hear from them regularly if you stay in touch via text rather than email.\n\nSocial activities available on the Web offer endless opportunities for interacting with grandchildren near or far. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nEven under the same roof, connecting with screen-obsessed grandchildren on their own turf can be fun and emotionally rewarding. When my son hangs out with his grandmother, he plays his favorite Lego games on her iPad, sitting close beside her so he can explain each step of his gameplay. She loves engaging him in conversation (even about a videogame!), and he loves having an enthusiastic audience.\n\nGet outside: \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go\u201d conquered the world this summer, as both adults and children roamed the streets, searching for virtual Pok\u00e9mon (animated creatures) using their smartphones or other hand-held devices. Even if you\u2019re not a \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go\u201d player, taking the grandchildren Pok\u00e9mon hunting can be a great way to get them out to a nearby park or historical landmark.\n\nAnother possibility for outdoor romps: geocaching. Think of it as a treasure hunt that uses a mobile phone: Using a geocaching app, or a standard GPS device, you get directions to the GPS coordinates of a local \u201ccache,\u201d where you will find some kind of small treasure. These caches can be hard to find, so the children may spend quite a bit of time exploring. Once you\u2019ve found a treasure, leave a new one behind\u2014a tiny dollar-store toy is perfect.\n\nHands-on activities: Finally, for more tangible pursuits, hobby sites like Instructables, Pinterest or Craftster can give you ideas for building, craft or creative projects you can undertake with your grandchildren. These sites offer step-by-step instructions on anything from making a birdhouse to creating your own bath soap. Find inspiring ideas for weekend projects you can tackle with the grandchildren, or instructions for a project you already have in mind. For children who enjoy crafts or construction, your help can unlock a whole new set of possibilities.\n\nMs. Samuel, a frequent contributor to the Journal Reports, is a technology researcher and the author of \u201cWork Smarter With Social Media.\u201d She can be reached at reports@wsj.com.", "date": null, "title": "How to Use Online Games and Activities to Connect to Grandchildren"}

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-q-a-on-paying-for-college-1457321022", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Illustration: Dan Page\n\nReaders continue to wonder about the best way to save for and pay for college. We asked two experts to weigh in on some recent reader questions about college finance. As usual, there were questions about the popular \u201c529\u201d accounts, the state-sponsored plans that typically invest in mutual funds and allow college savings to grow tax-free.\n\nOur grandson, who is a sophomore in college, had a summer job last year. We would like him to open a Roth IRA account, and would be giving him the funds to do this. Would this affect his ability to obtain college aid?\n\nYes. \u201cThe Roth IRA is sheltered as an asset, but the summer earnings and gift from grandparents are considered income,\u201d says David Levy, editor of educational website Edvisors.com and a former financial-aid director at several colleges. When a student earns money, total student income\u2014adjusted gross income plus any untaxed income, such as this gift from his grandparents\u2014starts affecting financial-aid decisions once it rises above $6,400. Above that income level, aid will go down by half the excess, Mr. Levy says.\n\n8 Questions to Answer About Investing for Retirement Everyone hopes to enter retirement with enough money to pay the bills. The key is understanding how to save and invest long before you retire. VIEW Interactive\n\nIf you plan to use the money you put into his Roth IRA to help pay for college, be aware that the money won\u2019t be tax-free for him.\n\n\u201cFor a withdrawal from a Roth to be tax-free, the account owner must be at least 59\u00bd years of age and the account must have been in existence for at least five years, so the student should be prepared to pay taxes on the earnings withdrawn,\u201d says Rob Kron, head of investment and retirement education for BlackRock. In addition, the amount he takes out\u2014principal and earnings\u2014counts as income on next year\u2019s financial-aid form.\n\nAnd remember that to open any kind of IRA in the first place, he can only contribute the amount he earned that year, up to the maximum $5,500, regardless of whether you give him the money.\n\nWe have an Ohio 529 account for our 1-year-old son. We\u2019re expecting another child in March, and planning to move from Ohio to Michigan in June. My understanding is that if we tried to roll the Ohio 529 into a Michigan 529, we\u2019d need to repay the tax deductions we already received. To avoid that, can we keep the Ohio 529 for our first child and open a new one for him in Michigan? If so, can we fund both accounts and receive tax deductions in both states this year? Similarly, can we open and fund accounts in both states this year for our second child?\n\nYou\u2019ll be paying taxes for part of the year in both Ohio and Michigan, so you should be able to hold 529 accounts in both states and receive deductions on your partial-year state tax returns, Mr. Kron says.\n\n\u201cThere is no rule prohibiting multiple accounts in multiple state plans for the same beneficiary as a taxpayer resident and earning a state tax deduction for contributions to each account,\u201d Mr. Kron says.\n\nAfter you move, you don\u2019t have to close the Ohio accounts. If you choose to roll them over into Michigan accounts you won\u2019t get a Michigan deduction on the amounts you rolled over, Mr. Kron says. When your children go to college someday, it won\u2019t matter in what state they choose to attend school; they can use the money from their 529 accounts regardless.\n\nColleges, under their \u201ccost of attendance,\u201d sometimes list expenses that the IRS says don\u2019t qualify for reimbursement under 529 rules. How can 529 owners be sure which costs of attendance qualify for reimbursement?\n\nIt is a question of definitions. The 529 rules say that money from these funds can be used for tuition, fees, books and supplies, plus room and board if the student is enrolled half-time or more, subject to some restrictions, says Mr. Levy, the Edvisors.com editor. Withdrawals from a 529 are also considered qualified when the money is used for the purchase of computers, printers and Internet access, as well as special-needs services if the student requires them to attend school.\n\nBut some other expense categories the college considers part of its costs of attendance don\u2019t qualify: \u201cFor example, transportation and miscellaneous personal expenses often included by a college as costs of attendance aren't qualified expenses under 529 provisions,\u201d Mr. Kron says.\n\nBe sure to ask the college what exactly goes into its cost of attendance, to make sure you\u2019re calculating accurately how much you can take from your 529 without incurring penalties.\n\nWhen in doubt, check the IRS rules in Publication 970, page 59.\n\nI have a 529 account for my grandson, who will be graduating this year. Can I withdraw money remaining in the 529 to help him repay his loans?\n\nWe get this question from readers frequently, and the answer is, unfortunately, no, not without taxes and penalties.\n\n\u201cThe money can be used to help your grandson repay his student loans,\u201d Mr. Levy says, \u201cbut it will be a nonqualified distribution, subject to ordinary income taxes at the beneficiary\u2019s rate plus a 10% tax penalty, since student loans aren\u2019t a qualified higher-education expense.\u201d\n\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whatever-happened-to-that-old-401-k-1480302720", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Experts say the problem of lost or forgotten 401(k)s, pensions and other employer-sponsored retirement accounts is likely to grow worse, partly due to increasing use of automatic enrollments in 401(k)s. Illustration: Izhar Cohen for The wall Street Journal\n\nSuspect you may have lost track of a 401(k) retirement account or pension benefit?\n\nYou aren\u2019t alone.\n\nAs Americans jump from job to job, they are leaving more 401(k)-style accounts and pension benefits with ex-employers. Some lose track of the money, forfeiting a piece of their retirement security.\n\nWhile no one keeps exact tabs on the number of lost retirement accounts, human-resources consulting firm Aon Hewitt estimates that as many as 30% of all pension accounts may ultimately fall into this category\u2014either because a plan can no longer locate former employees who move or change names, or because a participant forgets that he or she is entitled to benefits or cannot find a past employer that changed its name.\n\nWhen the U.S. Department of Labor recently studied the public filings of 50 large pension plans in the six states that fall within its Philadelphia office\u2019s jurisdiction, it found more than 70,000 participants older than 65\u2014the age at which pension plans typically start paying benefits\u2014who were entitled to \u201cwell over $100 million in annual benefits\u201d but weren't collecting them, says Michael Schloss, director of the Philadelphia Regional office.\n\nWhen the agency contacted over 5,000 of these people, it discovered \u201ca very large percent didn\u2019t know they even had a pension,\u201d Mr. Schloss says.\n\nExperts say the problem is likely to get worse. A 2014 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office says the growing use of automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans and shorter job tenures is contributing to participants having inactive 401(k) accounts.\n\nU.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Steve Daines (R., Mont.) recently introduced a bill to use Internal Revenue Service data to start an online database that individuals could use to look up their pension and 401(k)-style retirement accounts.\n\nMeanwhile, what can you do if you think you lost track of an account or benefit?\n\nStarting a search\n\nThe first step is to find your old employer and send a letter or email requesting information about your retirement benefit, says Joseph Adams, a lawyer who specializes in retirement plans at McDermott Will & Emery LLP.\n\nIf the company no longer exists or you just can\u2019t find it, free help is available from sources including the Labor Department and six nonprofit pension-counseling centers funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Administration for Community Living (See table). The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., or PBGC, provides help locating traditional pensions.\n\nThese services can tap into public databases that list incorporations and bankruptcies and may be able to help participants dig up a plan\u2019s most recently filed Form 5500, the annual report that must be filed with the IRS, PBGC and the Labor Department. This form contains the plan\u2019s contact information and the employer\u2019s identification number, which can be used to locate any plan that inherited the assets in a merger, acquisition or sale, says Judith Starr, general counsel at the PBGC.\n\nRecently filed 5500s can be found on websites such as freeerisa.com and efast.dol.gov. It also is possible to request older filings.\n\nIf a former employer terminated its defined benefit pension plan, check with the PBGC. The agency maintains a searchable database of missing participants in the underfunded pension plans it takes over, as well as pension plans terminated by employers.\n\nTransferred funds\n\nFinding a lost 401(k) account can get tricky if the balance in the account is $5,000 or less. Federal law allows plans to transfer balances of up to that size to an individual retirement account at a financial-services firm\u2014without the missing participant\u2019s consent. To find it, you can call or search the online databases of companies that accept transfers of small balances from 401(k) plans. They include Millennium Trust Co., PenChecks Trust, Inspira and Retirement Clearinghouse LLC.\n\nWhen a company terminates a 401(k) plan, it must transfer all accounts to participants. If a participant can\u2019t be located, the firm can send the money to an IRA, bank account or a state\u2019s unclaimed property fund. Some plans may transfer the 401(k) accounts of missing participants older than 70\u00bd\u2014the age at which the IRS requires people to start taking withdrawals\u2014to state unclaimed property funds. Search the state where you lived or worked or where the plan\u2019s administrator is incorporated, advises Tami Salmon, associate general counsel at the trade group Investment Company Institute.\n\nStarting in 2018, the PBGC will accept transfers of missing participants\u2019 accounts from terminating 401(k) plans, says Ms. Starr. When the participants are found, it will pay them that money plus interest. The agency also plans to launch a registry of terminated 401(k) plans that sent money elsewhere, so missing participants can more easily find their accounts. Participation by employers is voluntary.\n\nMore complicated still are situations in which former employees are denied pension benefits they believe they are owed.\n\nIn such a situation, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t assume a company\u2019s records are perfect,\u201d says Jeanne Medeiros, director of the Pension Action Center in Boston, a nonprofit that helps reunite people with their retirement funds.\n\nTo prove eligibility for pension benefits, participants may need to dig up old employment records including W-2 forms and notifications from a pension plan of a vested benefit, Ms. Medeiros says.

The facts say otherwise. Photo: Getty Images\n\nThere\u2019s a stereotypical view of job opportunities for older workers, and it\u2019s not pretty.\n\nIt goes something like this. If you\u2019re past 50 and thinking of a career switch, forget it. The opportunities for older workers in the new economy are pretty much nonexistent. And you\u2019re in even worse shape if you\u2019re in your 50s or 60s and retired but want to get back into the workforce in a job that is both challenging and financially rewarding. The only spots available are low-skilled and low-paying\u2014whether that\u2019s burger flipper, Wal-Mart greeter or Uber driver.\n\nBoy, have a lot of people have been misinformed.\n\nThe numbers make it clear that the nightmare scenario simply isn\u2019t true. The 55-and-older crowd is now the only age group with a rising labor-force participation rate, even as age discrimination remains a problem for many older job seekers. Workers age 50 or older now comprise 33.4% of the U.S. labor force, up from 25% in 2002. And more than 60% of workers age 65 or older now hold full-time positions, up from 44% in 1995.\n\nIn addition, a large part of the long-term increase in employment growth has come from skilled jobs in professional-services industries, according to a 2013 academic paper. Another study found that from 1996 to 2012, just 1.4% of job seekers in their early to mid 50s landed in \u201cold person\u201d occupations\u2014typically \u201clow-paying, low-status\u201d jobs in which older hires outnumber younger hires by at least 2 to 1.\n\n\u201cThese are good jobs,\u201d says Nicole Maestas, an economist and associate professor of health-care policy at Harvard Medical School and a co-author of the 2013 study. Moreover, she adds, older workers with experience and education \u201care competitive for these jobs, especially with their greater work experience.\u201d\n\nStill, the myths persist despite all the evidence to the contrary. Here are five prevalent misconceptions about working in later life\u2014along with recent research that dispels those misconceptions.\n\nMyth 1: I\u2019m not going to find a good job.\n\nREALITY: Baby boomers are getting jobs with better pay, status and working conditions than prior generations of older workers.\n\nOlder workers are benefiting from a number of trends\u2014in the economy, the workforce and their own profile. For one thing, many boomers are living longer and staying healthier than prior generations. So they\u2019re able to take on more demanding work and are better able to keep pace with younger peers.\n\nMoreover, as the U.S. economy shifts from manufacturing to services, it\u2019s creating more positions in which cognitive skills matter more than physical ability. That means more opportunities for older workers.\n\n\u201cWe have more older-worker-friendly jobs now than we used to,\u201d says David Powell, an economist at the nonprofit policy-research organization Rand Corp. and a co-author of the 2013 study with Prof. Maestas.\n\nThen there\u2019s a critical factor that may give older workers a leg up on younger ones: experience. At a time when many employers are grumbling about a shortage of skilled workers, older Americans have much more work experience than younger ones and may even seem like better prospects to many employers.\n\n\u201cThe labor-demand study simply shows that when there is a shortage of skilled workers, older workers get jobs,\u201d says Prof. Maestas.\n\nBaby boomers are also better educated than previous generations of older workers, making them much better able to compete for positions. According to Harvard economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz, in 1990, 65-year-olds had an average of 11.5 years of schooling, or 1.8 years less than the 13.3-year average for 25-year-olds.\n\nBy 2010, Prof. Maestas calculates, older adults had 12.6 years of education, on average, versus 13.9 years for 25-year-olds. She and a co-author project the 1.3 year gap will shrink to just six months by 2030.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly, older workers\u2019 qualifications look almost the same as [those of] their younger counterparts,\u201d says Matthew Rutledge, research economist at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College and a co-author of the paper on people in \u201cold person\u201d occupations. In fact, he adds, they \u201cmay even look better because they have experience.\u201d\n\nMyth 2: You can\u2019t take time off, or you\u2019ll never get back into the workforce\n\nREALITY: About 40% of people who retire take a break and then return to work, typically within two years.\n\nThose findings come from Prof. Maestas, who used data from the Health and Retirement Study funded by the National Institute on Aging and conducted at the University of Michigan, which has tracked thousands of people over the age of 50 over the past two decades. About 60% of the study participants who took career breaks between 1992 and 2002 moved into new professions, according to Prof. Maestas.\n\nAs the U.S. economy shifts from manufacturing to services, it\u2019s creating more positions in which cognitive skills matter more than physical ability. That means more opportunities for older workers. Photo: Stephen Webster for The Wall Street Journal\n\n\u201cMany people reboot and do something new,\u201d says Prof. Maestas, who says data from research published in 1990 indicates only 25% of older workers who retired in the 1970s took time off and returned to work.\n\nWhy the increase? One explanation is that the breaks may not be as harmful to a career as they used to be, given the shift toward service work. \u201cBlue-collar work is typically more demanding and physical skills probably deteriorate faster than the interpersonal and knowledge-based skills that are more prevalent in services and white-collar work,\u201d says U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics research economist Michael Giandrea.\n\nAnother surprise from the research into retirees who take breaks and then return to working: Economic necessity doesn\u2019t appear to play a big role in the decision. \u201cIt is not the poorest who return to work,\u201d says Prof. Maestas. \u201cIt is the better off. It isn\u2019t the lower educated. It is the highest educated. Every way you look at the data, it correlates with choice rather than economic necessity.\u201d\n\nMr. Giandrea says that many people are interested in the \u201cnonmonetary benefits of continued employment,\u201d including \u201cmental stimulation and continued social networks.\u201d Plus, he adds, \u201cI think it\u2019s the case that many people like their jobs. We think people are revealing what they prefer through their actions. If they are continuing to work in later life, it\u2019s certainly possible that they like their work.\u201d\n\nStill, older workers who take time off should be aware that the odds of becoming re-employed decline with age. According to a biennial survey sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor, 73% of 25- to 54-year-olds who lost jobs between 2013 and 2015 that they had held for three or more years were re-employed by January 2016. For 55- to 64-year-olds, in contrast, the figure is 60%.\n\nMyth 3: I\u2019m not going to make as big of a contribution as I did in the past.\n\nREALITY: Older workers can play a more vital role than ever.\n\nWhen it comes to productivity, most academic studies show little to no relationship between age and job performance, says Harvey Sterns, director of the Institute for Life-Span Development and Gerontology at the University of Akron. Already, that shows that the popular view of older workers as dead wood simply isn\u2019t true. But some research goes even further: In jobs that require experience, these studies show that older adults have a performance edge.\n\nIn a study published in 2015, economists at institutions including the Max Planck Institute for Social Law and Social Policy, a nonprofit research organization in Munich, examined the number and severity of errors made by 3,800 workers on a Mercedes-Benz assembly line from 2003 to 2006. The economists determined that over that four-year period, rates of errors by younger workers edged up, while the rates for older workers declined. Moreover, the frequency of severe errors decreased with age.\n\nA new study by some of the same authors looked at a large German insurance company, and found no overall link between age and productivity. But in \u201cmore demanding tasks,\u201d says co-author Matthias Weiss, a professor at the University of Applied Sciences Regensburg, productivity rises with age. Experience offsets \u201cphysical and cognitive decline in the more demanding tasks,\u201d the study says.\n\nThere may be deep neurological factors at play. Academics have found that knowledge and certain types of intelligence continue to develop in ways that can offset age-related declines in the brain\u2019s ability to process new information and reason abstractly. Expertise deepens, which can enhance productivity and creativity. Some go so far as to say that wisdom\u2014defined, in part, as the ability to resolve conflicts by seeing problems from multiple perspectives\u2014flourishes.\n\nWisdom doesn\u2019t just help basic job performance: It makes older workers into valuable role models for younger employees. Older workers who spend time mentoring, lecturing, consulting, advising and teaching can make a \u201chuge contribution,\u201d says Brian Fetherstonhaugh, chairman and chief executive of digital and direct-marketing agency OgilvyOne Worldwide, and author of \u201cThe Long View: Career Strategies to Start Strong, Reach High, and Go Far.\u201d\n\nOlder workers, he adds, are in a position to teach \u201cthe trickiest things younger workers need to learn, including sound judgment and how to build trust\u201d with colleagues and clients.\n\nMyth 4: The only type of work available to older applicants is part time.\n\nREALITY: Since 1995, the number of people age 65 or older working full time has more than tripled.\n\nThat increase compares with just 56% for part-timers in the same age group. In all, 62% of workers 65-plus are now full-time workers, up from 44% in 1995, according to BLS statistics. \u201cThe rise in full-time employment among older workers tells us there are opportunities for them,\u201d says Mr. Giandrea.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, not many part-timers\u2014just 5%\u2014would prefer to work full-time, he says. \u201cNot only has full-time employment grown, but among those who usually work part-time, almost all want to work part time,\u201d he says.\n\nWhy the shift to full-time jobs? Once again, the answer may come down to experience. \u201cOlder individuals may find that their job skills continue to be valuable in the service and white-collar work that is becoming more prevalent, thereby enabling them to extend their work lives,\u201d Mr. Giandrea says.\n\nMyth 5: The chance to be an entrepreneur has passed me by.\n\nREALITY: Americans in their 50s and 60s make up a growing share of entrepreneurs.\n\nAccording to the nonprofit Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, individuals between the ages of 55 and 64 represented 24.3% of the entrepreneurs who launched businesses in 2015, up from 14.8% in 1996.\n\nIn contrast, despite their reputation for having an entrepreneurial bent, Americans ages 20 to 34 launched 25% of the startups in 2015, down from 34% in 1996%.\n\nThe data indicate \u201cthe United States might be on the cusp of an entrepreneurship boom\u2014not in spite of an aging population but because of it,\u201d writes Dane Stangler, vice president of research and policy at Kauffman.\n\nExperts say that with years of experience and savings to back their ideas, the baby boomers typically have advantages that younger adults lack when it comes to launching new ventures. Perhaps as a result, older entrepreneurs have higher success rates.\n\nAccording to a 2008 report by researchers at City University of London\u2019s Cass Business School, 70% of startups founded by people age 50 or older last longer than three years, versus 28% for those younger than 50.\n\nIn a 2009 study of more than 500 successful U.S. technology and engineering startups founded between 1995 and 2005, academics at Duke, Cornell and Harvard universities found that twice as many of the companies were launched by people over 50 as under 25. (The authors defined success as the company having at least $1 million in revenue, among other things.)\n\n\u201cExperience really counts,\u201d says co-author Vivek Wadhwa, now a fellow at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, for most, finances aren\u2019t the main driving factor in the decision. \u201cFor many people, entrepreneurship is a choice they make,\u201d says Arnobio Morelix, a senior research analyst at the Kauffman Foundation.\n\nThe trend, he adds, \u201cseems to have very little to do with boomers being forced into\u201d starting their own businesses. Indeed, according to Kauffman, just 16% of the oldest entrepreneurs report being unemployed before starting a business, the lowest rate among all age groups.\n\nAccording to a 2015 Gallup Inc. poll, 32% of baby boomers who launched businesses say that they did so because it allows them to be independent. Another 27% say that it\u2019s to \u201cpursue their interests and passions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to pick your own hours if you are your own boss,\u201d Mr. Morelix says.\n\nIn contrast, about one-fourth (24%) of baby boomers say that they started a business to supplement their income, while just 4% say they made the move because there are \u201cno jobs available in my area.\u201d\n\nMs. Tergesen is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

I am 72 and single. The problem: I\u2019m having difficulty finding new friends.\n\nThat is from the first letter in the July 5 edition of this column. A retiree in California asked us if we would ask you, the Journal\u2019s readers, to suggest how to build new ties in later life.\n\nThe response was overwhelming. More than 200 readers emailed us with suggestions, which we have passed on to this individual. (And on behalf of that person: Thanks to all.)\n\nAsk a Question Have a question about planning for and living in retirement? Email askencore@wsj.com\n\nThe theme in the emails: Don\u2019t look for friends, per se. Rather, identify your interests\u2014how you enjoy spending time\u2014look for groups and settings where others share the interests, and friends will follow. Among the starting points: meetup.com (a doorway to thousands of groups across the country), Rotary International (the service organization), Facebook, Toastmasters International (with a focus on developing communication and leadership skills) and Road Scholar (educational travel).\n\nMany of the emails can be read here. Following are some of the strategies that caught our eye:\n\nFitness. Many readers urged our retiree to join a gym, health club or walking group. And \u201cif you can\u2019t find one, start one yourself,\u201d one wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s easy, no equipment needed.\u201d\n\nEducation. In addition to the organizations listed above, many readers cited Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes, operating on more than 100 college campuses across the country, as the single best way to meet people and find friends.\n\nDogs. As in: Get one. Dozens of readers swear by this. As one put it: \u201cWalk your dog several times a day\u2014same time and same route. Keep a pocket full of small doggy treats for the times you meet strangers with dogs. Ask if you could offer a treat. Your dog will make friends for you.\u201d\n\nPolitics. An election year is an opportunity to join a local political group or movement and meet like-minded individuals.\n\nCharity. \u201cHost at least one charitable function every year,\u201d one reader suggested. \u201cBuy a table at the local hospital/Boy Scouts/symphony fundraiser and invite people you have met and want to get to know better. That act of kindness and generosity is remembered, and reciprocal invitations will follow.\u201d\n\nFinally, many readers offered the same advice: Make the effort to say hello to people\u2014to introduce yourself\u2014however difficult that is. The payoff, as one reader said, can be life-changing: \u201cOne of my dear friends took the course for docents at the Getty Museum, where she met a fellow student, also an older retiree. Both were single at that time. He was attracted to her energy [and] her willingness to organize the luncheon to mark the end of the docent course. He immediately volunteered to assist her in this effort. That was the start of a strong friendship, culminating in a loving marriage, and 20 years of happiness for both of them. Need I say more!\u201d\n\nI have a six-figure Roth IRA, and I am considering naming two of my very young grandchildren as contingent beneficiaries. (My wife is the primary beneficiary.) My questions: What happens if my wife should die before me and my grandchildren inherit the Roth? Can they retain the funds as their own Roth? Must they begin taking distributions after inheriting? Are distributions taxable to them?\n\nYes, grandchildren would have to begin withdrawing funds from the inherited account, and no, withdrawals (assuming the Roth IRA is at least five years old) wouldn\u2019t be taxed. But there\u2019s a bigger issue: Do you really want \u201cvery young\u201d grandchildren inheriting a six-figure account to spend as they please?\n\nBefore we tackle that question, let\u2019s take a step back.\n\nIf your wife dies before you and if your grandchildren inherit your Roth, they should first split the account into two separate, and properly titled, inherited Roth IRAs, says Ed Slott, an IRA specialist in Rockville Centre, N.Y. Example: \u201cJohn Smith (deceased 7/30/16) Roth IRA, for the benefit of Mary Smith, beneficiary.\u201d (The second inherited Roth would have the same title, except for the name of the other child as beneficiary.)\n\nThe split should be done as a direct transfer to the two new accounts, and must take place by Dec. 31 of the year after your death. Upon dividing the account and meeting the deadline, each grandchild would take required distributions each year. (The size of each annual withdrawal is based on the IRS Single Life Expectancy table, found in IRS publication 590-B.)\n\nAgain, annual withdrawals would be tax-free to grandchildren. (And no: They couldn\u2019t transfer funds to their own Roths, if they had such accounts. Only a spouse can transfer inherited IRA funds to his or her own IRA.) Indeed, grandchildren could withdraw more than the required minimum each year\u2014and it would all be tax-free, Mr. Slott notes.\n\nWhich brings us back to the question: Is there a better way to pass on a sizable IRA to young heirs? Mr. Slott suggests naming a trust, for the grandchildren\u2019s benefit, as the beneficiary\u2014at least until they reach what you consider a responsible age. And not just \u201cany trust will do,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt must be a valid \u2018see-through\u2019 trust,\u201d one in which beneficiaries are individually identifiable and which complies with IRS requirements.\n\nMr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal, and co-author of \u201cThe Wall Street Journal Complete Retirement Guidebook.\u201d His column examines financial issues for those thinking about, planning and living their retirement.

Is there a \u201cbest\u201d (or better) asset allocation for someone entering retirement?\n\nThe best allocation for any investor is the one where the mix of stocks, bonds, cash and alternative investments allows you to sleep at night. That said, this question raises a good point: A nasty bear market early in retirement, coupled with steady withdrawals from a nest egg, can quickly drain one\u2019s savings.\n\nThe traditional advice is to subtract your age from 100, which gives you the percentage of assets you should hold in stocks. (If you\u2019re 65 years old, 35% of your assets should be in stocks; the balance goes in bonds.) As you age, you gradually shift the bulk of your portfolio to the relative safety of bonds.\n\nAsk a Question Have a question about planning for and living in retirement? Email askencore@wsj.com\n\nToday, many advisers\u2014given increases in life expectancy\u2014are urging would-be retirees to tweak this formula and subtract one\u2019s age from 110 or even 120. This means individuals age 65 would have 45% or 55% of their holdings in stocks, which, presumably, would help generate the growth needed for a long retirement.\n\nThat is all well and good. But ask yourself: Could you stomach a drop of almost 40% in the S&P 500 (see: 2008) if half of your nest egg was invested in stocks?\n\nWith all of this in mind, first consider one of the most noteworthy financial studies of recent years. Wade Pfau, a professor of retirement income at the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and Michael Kitces, director of wealth management at Pinnacle Advisory Group Inc. in Columbia, Md., found that individuals who start retirement with as little as 20% or 30% of their nest eggs in stocks and gradually raise their exposure to stocks over time are likely to make their money last longer.\n\nThe bonus: You have better downside protection in the early years of retirement, because if a bear market hits, you are less likely to have to sell stocks whose values are depressed as a result. (Go to onefpa.org and search for: Reducing Retirement Risk With a Rising Equity Glide Path.)\n\nSecond, run some numbers. A number of financial calculators can show you how various asset allocations might play out over time. Among them: analyzenow.com (click on Computer Programs and Pre & Post Retirement Planner); firecalc.com; T. Rowe Price Group\u2019s Retirement Income Calculator (www3.troweprice.com/ric/ricweb/public/ric.do); and Vanguard Group\u2019s Retirement Nest Egg Calculator (go to retirementplans.vanguard.com and, at the top of the page, click on: Tools).\n\nFinally, never rely on any single calculator for answers.

Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nIf a retired individual moves abroad, can he or she still collect Social Security? What about Medicare?\n\nApparently you can take it with you, when it comes to Social Security payments. Retirees living outside the U.S. in most cases can have their Social Security payments deposited electronically in a bank here and transfer the funds to an account overseas. A second option: a direct deposit in a financial institution in a retiree\u2019s adopted country\u2014as long as that country has a direct-deposit agreement with the U.S. (Go to socialsecurity.gov and search for: IDD Countries.)\n\nA retiree who wishes to receive a paper check overseas can request an exemption from the Treasury Department to its requirement (since 2011) that Social Security checks be deposited electronically.\n\nNote: We say \u201cin most cases\u201d above because Treasury regulations prohibit Social Security payments to U.S. citizens in North Korea or Cuba, as well as several areas that were once part of the Soviet Union. (Think: Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, etc.) None of these appear to be retirement hot spots, however.\n\nAs for Medicare, the program works only in the U.S., with limited exceptions. (See medicare.gov and search for: coverage outside the U.S.) A retiree living overseas would need to consider other options, such as buying private insurance before moving, or enrolling (if possible) in health coverage abroad.\n\nSome might decide they still want to keep\u2014and pay for\u2014Medicare coverage, thus preserving the option of U.S.-based medical care even as they continue to be based abroad. In that case, Medicare Part A, which covers hospital bills, is free for most individuals age 65-plus. But Medicare Part B, which covers doctors\u2019 services, costs between $104.90 and $389.80 a month, depending on one\u2019s income. If a retiree plans to settle overseas, it might make sense to drop (or not enroll in) Part B.\n\nIf a retiree returns to the U.S. and wishes to start Part B coverage, the premium could be 10% higher for each 12-month period that person could have been enrolled but wasn\u2019t.\n\n***\n\nIn a response to a recent question about financial advisers, you recommended \u201cmeeting with a financial planner who charges by the hour.\u201d My question: How do I find such a person? I have called quite a few financial planners and all of them will work only for a percent of assets under management.\n\nStart with Garrett Planning Network, whose members specialize in hourly advice. Online service LearnVest.com has affordable planning packages and lets you speak with an adviser. You can also try the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors and the Financial Planning Association. Both groups allow you to search for advisers and financial planners in your area, and you can ask whether they accept hourly clients.\n\n***\n\nI just came across several Series EE savings bonds purchased in 1998 and 1999 by my now-deceased stepmother. All are payable-on-death to me. Must I cash them in now, or can I retain them and continue to accumulate interest? If I cash them in, must I contact the Federal Reserve directly, or can my local bank handle this matter? Are there online forms to complete to cash these bonds?\n\nYou don\u2019t need to cash in. Your bonds are still earning interest\u2014and will continue to do so until 2028 (for bonds purchased in 1998) and 2029 (for bonds purchased in 1999). The best thing to do: Take a step back and avoid the all-too-common mistakes that investors make when dealing with savings bonds.\n\nThe first: cashing in bonds arbitrarily, says Jackie Brahney, marketing director of SavingsBonds.com, a website for savings-bond holders. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand what their bonds are actually worth, what they\u2019re earning, or when and how interest is paid,\u201d she says.\n\nLet\u2019s say your stepmother purchased a paper EE bond (vs. an electronic bond) with a face value of $500 in July 1998. At the time, she paid $250. (That\u2019s how paper purchases worked then; a buyer paid half the face value, and the bond began earning interest on the purchase price.) Today, that bond is worth $508 and is earning 1.31%, according to TreasuryDirect.gov, (an excellent source of information about savings bonds). By comparison, money-market accounts nationwide currently are returning an average of 0.11%, according to Bankrate.com.\n\nEvery six months, the Treasury Department adjusts the interest rate on this particular savings bond (as it does with all EE bonds bought from May 1997 through April 2005); and twice a year, all the interest that the bond has earned in the previous six months is added to the value of the bond. If you cash in just a day or two before that six-month period is up, you miss six months of interest.\n\nThe second big mistake: failing to understand the tax consequences of redeeming savings bonds. When you cash in, you pay federal income tax (but not state or local) on the interest the bond has earned.

And that wealth transfer raises lots of questions on how to navigate the tricky world of college financing.\n\nTo help readers understand the regulations governing college aid and the tax implications, we once again have tapped experts for their advice and insights. Read on for reader questions and expert answers on paying for college.\n\nCan a grandparent pay for a grandchild\u2019s college tuition and still be able to give a $14,000 gift to cover other expenses?\n\nYes, but there are some important caveats.\n\n\u201cAnyone can pay college tuition directly to the institution and still be able to make a gift of $14,000 to their grandchild\u2026without affecting their annual gift-tax exclusion for that individual,\u201d says James Canup, partner and chairman of the tax practice at the Hirschler Fleischer law firm in Richmond, Va. That $14,000 is the maximum a grandparent generally can give to each grandchild in one year without having to report it for federal gift-tax purposes (although having to report a gift doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that tax will be due).\n\nAsk Us a Question Have a college-finance question? We\u2019ll be answering them in future funds reports. Send them to reports@wsj.com.\n\nTwo important things to keep in mind: First, tuition is the operative word in the reader\u2019s question, experts say. The grandparent\u2019s payment must be for tuition at a qualified institution\u2014not room, not board, not books.\n\nSecond, the tuition payment must be made directly to the institution by the giver, according to experts. The funds can\u2019t go to the student, the parents or anyone else except the college. Grandparents, make that check payable to the bursar.\n\nExperts also caution that helping a grandchild out this way could lessen the amount of need-based financial aid the student receives. Some schools treat direct tuition payments as \u201ccash support,\u201d says Mark Kantrowitz, senior vice president and publisher of college-planning website Edvisors.com. Such support has to be reported on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or Fafsa, and could reduce aid eligibility by as much as half, Mr. Kantrowitz says.\n\nIf a child borrows money for college, can a grandparent use a \u201c529\u201d account to pay off the loan after graduation?\n\nBeware if you\u2019re considering wading into this area. The answer is yes, no and maybe.\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind a potentially large tax hit, the answer is yes, because a grandparent (or anyone) could theoretically do anything with the funds in a 529 college-savings plan.\n\nIf you want to avoid a tax hit, the answer is no. Loan payments aren\u2019t among the qualified higher-education expenses for which 529 accounts can be used without triggering tax penalties.\n\n\u201cAlthough it\u2019s understandable to assume that student loans resulted from qualified higher-education expenses over time, the fact of the matter is that the IRS views the repayment of loans as a nonqualified expense,\u201d says Andy Hickman, co-founder of college-planning website College Quest Alliance LLC, of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s treatment of such 529 distributions.\n\nAs such, the earnings portion of a distribution from a grandparent\u2019s 529 account to repay college loans would need to be reported as taxable income and would be subject to a 10% tax penalty.\n\nAs for the maybe, there is a potential exception to the rule: \u201cIf a student received any tax-free scholarships, withdrawals from the 529 equaling the amount of these scholarships may be withdrawn from the 529 without penalty,\u201d Mr. Hickman says.\n\nI am paying for my granddaughter\u2019s college tuition, but she will pay me back with a small interest charge. Will she be able to deduct this interest on her taxes and, if so, what kind of documentation does she need to support the deduction?\n\nGrandparents who want to pay for their grandchild\u2019s tuition have to keep some details in mind. Photo: iStock/Getty Images\n\nNo. While it might be tempting to deduct college-loan interest paid to the Bank of Granny & Gramps, in order for student loans to qualify for a tax deduction they cannot come from a broad range of people and groups considered \u201cfamily.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe IRS is fairly clear that a qualified student loan is not one which comes from a \u2018related person,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Hickman says.\n\nIn addition to grandparents, people defined as related by the IRS include those you would expect, such as spouses, siblings and children. But the group also includes half-siblings and even certain corporations, partnerships and trusts.\n\nFor more information on qualified student loans and the rules governing interest deductions, go to irs.gov and search for Publication 970 (\u201cTax Benefits for Education\u201d) or call 800-829-3676 on weekdays to request a copy.\n\nMr. Hershberg is a Wall Street Journal news editor in New York.

The Palo Alto, Calif.-based firm this spring began offering its automated Wealthfront 529 as an adviser-sold plan through Nevada. Wealthfront\u2019s 529 features savings recommendations and rebalancing services at a cost of 0.43% to 0.46% of assets annually, including underlying fund expenses. That is higher than some 529 plans sold directly to consumers.\n\nSeeking to become a more holistic financial-advice service, Wealthfront also announced \u201cWealthfront 3.0,\u201d which allows customers to link and get advice on external bank and savings accounts, and eventually will allow them to integrate real-estate data and credit-card accounts, as well.\n\nAs of June 1, Wealthfront had 83,000 customers and managed $3.5 billion in assets, according to regulatory filings.\n\nAcorns Grow of Irvine, Calif., is employing a strategy used by banks to help customers save money by \u201crounding up\u201d purchases to whole dollars and depositing the excess into savings accounts. In May, Acorns launched its \u201cFound Money\u201d program in partnership with retailers, where money is deposited directly into the brokerage accounts of customers who jump on a coupon deal or make another qualifying purchase.\n\nAcorns, which is backed by PayPal, among others, had 917,000 customers but only $197 million in assets under advisement through mid-July.\n\nBetterment LLC, which has $5.1 billion in assets under management and 176,500 clients, entered the 401(k) market in January, offering a low-cost plan for small businesses and their employees. The New York-based firm also began offering its automated investment service as a platform for other financial advisers.\n\nBusiness realities\n\nWhether the robo firms\u2019 burgeoning businesses remain independent or are bought by larger rivals depends on how much their financial backers are able to support product expansion in a highly competitive market.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure the venture capitalists ever really realized how tight the margins are in wealth management.

Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. have all said they plan to offer low-cost, automated investment services either on their own or by joining with a private-label robo adviser. And BlackRock Inc. a year ago bought FutureAdvisor, a San Francisco-based firm that has developed a tool that is similar to products offered by Wealthfront and Betterment.\n\nDemitry Estrin, a managing director of research firm MARU/VCR&C in New York, expects customers in the future will want a brokerage firm or adviser that offers any combination of three services levels\u2014self-directed, automated advice and professional input\u2014as well as some amount of financial planning and even insurance offerings.\n\nHow these companies pull it off and what they charge \u201cwill determine whether they keep the customer,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Weinberg is a writer in Connecticut.

Illustration: Daniel Downey for The Wall Street Journal\n\nHere\u2019s a seemingly simple question: When is Tax Day this year?\n\nEven for the most tax-law-challenged taxpayers, the answer might seem obvious: Individual income-tax returns are due April 15, a date as memorable to most Americans as the joyful holidays of Jan. 1, July 4 or Dec. 25.\n\nSimple but wrong\u2014for this year and last year and next year, for that matter.\n\nWhen it comes to taxes, it seems that rarely is anything truly simple, even Tax Day. The deadline can vary depending on several factors, such as the timing of weekends and the celebration of Emancipation Day in the District of Columbia. The date also may vary for millions of people, depending on various state holidays and even the timing of natural disasters such as severe storms and tornadoes.\n\nSo for most taxpayers this year, T-Day falls on April 18.\n\nHere is a mercifully brief explanation:\n\nThanks to Lincoln\n\nApril 15 this year falls on a Saturday. So it might be logical to assume that would push the tax-filing deadline back to Monday the 17th. No, because that\u2019s the day that Washington, D.C., will observe Emancipation Day this year.\n\nThat refers to emancipation from slavery, not taxes: the celebration of when President Abraham Lincoln signed a law on April 16, 1862, to end slavery in Washington. This year, the 16th is a Sunday, making Monday the 17th the day on which Emancipation Day is observed\u2014and bumping back the filing deadline for most people to Tuesday the 18th.\n\nJournal Report Podcast Subscribe to the Journal Report podcast at wsj.com, on iTunes or Google Play Music.\n\n\u201cBy law, D.C. holidays impact tax deadlines for everyone in the same way federal holidays do,\u201d the IRS explained earlier this year. Thus, the April deadline for filing and paying whatever might be owed to Uncle Sam for the 2016 tax year is Tuesday, April 18\u2014at least for most taxpayers.\n\nBut not all.\n\nMany people in parts of Georgia and Mississippi have until May 31 to file and pay, and parts of Louisiana get until June 30, an IRS spokesman says. There are other exceptions, too\u2014as well as different deadlines in some states.\n\nThe IRS can postpone certain deadlines for taxpayers who live, or have a business, in places designated as a federal disaster area. That\u2019s why some parts of Georgia, Mississippi and Louisiana have been given later filing deadlines this year. (For details, see the IRS website: irs.gov and look under \u201cTax Relief in Disaster Situations.\u201d) There are other deadlines for many taxpayers living and working abroad, as well as for members of the military serving in a combat zone.\n\nFor millions of procrastinators, of course, the April filing deadline simply means the deadline for requesting more time to file. They can ask the IRS for an additional six months, says Jeffery L. Yablon, a partner at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP in Washington who has compiled a splendid collection of quotes, quips and pithy sayings about taxes. (Here is one example: \u201cTaxes: Of life\u2019s two certainties, the only one for which you can get an automatic extension.\u201d Mr. Yablon attributes that to \u201canonymous,\u201d but reliable sources say it comes from a book called \u201cBuzzwords\u201d by John Freund and David Porter. )\n\nTo get a six-month filing extension, you don\u2019t even need to give a reason. But that doesn\u2019t give you more time to pay whatever you might owe. It only gives you more time to file. However, a six-month extension won\u2019t extend the deadline until Oct. 18. Instead, it will extend it to Monday, Oct. 16, the IRS says.\n\nThe IRS hasn\u2019t officially set the filing date yet for 2018, but it definitely won\u2019t be April 15 since that will fall on a Sunday. While it\u2019s hazardous to make any predictions about subjects involving taxes, especially this year, reliable sources say, based on the latest IRS guidance, T-Day 2018 will fall on April 17\u2014thus marking the third year in a row that the dreaded date won\u2019t be April 15.\n\nSome accountants and others have suggested moving away entirely from April as a filing deadline. Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nThe filing date in 2016 was tricky, too. Here\u2019s how the IRS explained it a year ago: \u201cTaxpayers have until Monday, April 18 to file their 2015 tax returns and pay any tax due because of the Emancipation Day holiday in Washington, D.C., falling on Friday, April 15. Taxpayers in Maine and Massachusetts will have until Tuesday, April 19 because of Patriots\u2019 Day observances on April 18.\u201d\n\nWhile many states follow the federal custom, some don\u2019t. When in doubt, check with your state tax department.\n\nWhy not scrap the April T-Day madness? Accountants, enrolled agents and other tax preparers have complained for years about the annual stresses of the April filing deadline, especially since so many perplexed clients wait until the 11th hour to share their shoeboxes stuffed with W-2 forms, 1099s, charitable-giving receipts and stacks of other documents.\n\nVote for change?\n\nSome people have suggested moving the deadline to Election Day\u2014or moving Election Day to April\u2014so that voters will focus more closely on what they get compared with what they pay.\n\nHowever, to change the date, congressional action would be required. And the path to congressional action on most tax-related subjects may be one of the few areas at least as complicated as our tax laws themselves.\n\nMr. Herman is a writer in New York and formerly The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Tax Report columnist.

Photo: Morningstar\n\nInstead, Mr. Lee says, investors should relate a fund\u2019s fees to its excess returns above a benchmark to see if the fund is earning its keep.\n\nHe made this argument in a recent Mutual Fund Observer article, and elaborated on the idea in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. He says investors should divide a fund\u2019s expense ratio by its \u201cgross excess return,\u201d which is the fund\u2019s expenses plus its excess returns after expenses above the fund\u2019s appropriate benchmark.\n\nThe resulting \u201ceffective performance fee\u201d reveals how much any outperformance has cost investors. The lower that performance fee is, the more excess returns investors get to keep.\n\nThe fund company ate our returns\n\nFor example, the $54 billion Dodge & Cox Stock Fund (DODGX) has produced a 7.12% annualized total return for the 15-year period through July 19. It has outperformed the 6.02% annualized return of the S&P 500 by 1.1 percentage points annually.\n\nThe fund\u2019s excess return over the Russell 1000 index\u2019s 6.36% annualized return is even thinner, clocking in at 0.76 percentage point.\n\nThe latter index can be a tougher one to beat when midcap stocks are racing, but fund researcher Morningstar Inc. indicates that it has recently been the fund\u2019s most appropriate benchmark, or the one it resembles most closely.\n\nIf we assume the fund\u2019s current 0.52% expense ratio held for the whole 15-year period (it has actually declined over the years, so that our calculation is erring slightly on behalf of the fund), the fund\u2019s effective performance fee for overcoming the S&P 500 is 32%. In other words, the fund kept nearly one-third of the gross excess return, which is its 0.52% fee and the 1.1% of annualized excess after-fee return.\n\nThe effective performance fee for overcoming the Russell 1000 index by a slimmer margin is more than 40%.\n\nMr. Lee says a 30% effective performance fee is reasonable, but points out that years can go by before an investor benefits from outperformance. Dodge & Cox Stock hasn\u2019t beaten the S&P 500 for a decade; most of its 15-year outperformance came in the years after the technology-stock bubble burst.\n\nHedge funds in drag?\n\nMr. Lee says looking at mutual-fund expenses this way shows that seemingly low-cost funds have fees comparable to hedge funds, which famously charge 2% of assets as a management fee and 20% of excess returns.\n\nDodge & Cox Stock might look cheap when one considers its absolute expense ratio without context. But its excess return is meager enough that its expenses, when judged against the outperformance it delivers, are hedge-fund-like.\n\nAnother way to look at it is the fund needs that low expense ratio to help it produce excess return over the index.\n\nIf the fund\u2019s fee was 1% (around the U.S.-stock fund average), its 15-year annualized excess return over the S&P 500 would have been cut nearly in half to around 0.60% annualized. The higher fee would have shrunk the fund\u2019s excess return over the Russell 1000 down to around 0.20% annually.\n\nIn a statement, Dodge & Cox Stock fund manager Charles Pohl says mutual-fund investors enjoy benefits of transparency and regulatory oversight, and that no type of fund is free\u2014even index investors have to pay something.\n\nHe also says the fund \u201chas significantly outperformed the S&P 500 net of fees and expenses over the past 20 years, and has provided shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns at a lower cost than most other mutual funds and hedge funds.\u201d\n\nIs outperformance worth the fee?\n\nIt is true that Dodge & Cox\u2019s 1.1% excess return over the S&P 500 index can amount to some serious extra money for an investor over decades. But because the annual excess return hasn\u2019t been large, a smaller fee, allowing an investor to keep a greater part of future excess returns, which themselves aren\u2019t certain, would encourage more confidence.\n\nAfter all, investors can now access low-cost \u201csmart beta\u201d strategies that have added more excess return in backtests than Dodge & Cox Stock has\u2014and charge lower fees.\n\nBecause the excess return is so small compared with the price paid on many active funds, Mr. Lee says investors should build portfolios using a barbell approach with some low-cost index funds and some more-expensive alternative funds that don\u2019t hug an index.\n\nMr. Coumarianos, a former Morningstar analyst, is a writer in California.

Illustration: Doug Chayka for The Wall Street Journal\n\nFund companies are about to go on the regulatory offensive in Washington. And their chances for success are looking pretty good.\n\nFor the past five years, it has been a totally different game plan, with asset managers playing defense against the federal government, scrambling to deflect a barrage of new regulations and letting a few get into the goal.\n\nBut with Republicans now controlling the White House, Congress and the regulatory agencies, sponsors of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are gearing up to fight for new regulations of their own\u2014regulations, they say, that would promote growth and innovation. And they expect the next leader of the Securities and Exchange Commission, breaking from Obama-era worries that funds could be a source of systemic financial risk, to favor these measures.\n\nAmong the proposals that may get a hearing: efforts to fast-track how most ETFs are approved, and a measure to change how shareholder reports are written and delivered to investors. Perhaps even more important, the industry hopes to alter\u2014or dump\u2014a number of rules proposed under the Obama administration that backers of both mutual funds and ETFs have complained about.\n\nThe result could provide a boost to the industry, easing the creation of new ETFs and easing requirements for existing ETFs and mutual funds. But a proliferation of new funds could mean heightened risks for investors, particularly regarding ETFs, because many of those funds don\u2019t trade frequently, making them more volatile.\n\nPerhaps the biggest potential changes on the horizon involve ETFs. Introduced in 1993, ETFs have grown to become a formidable presence in the world of funds. There are now more than 1,800 of the investment vehicles\u2014which trade on an exchange like stocks\u2014and their holdings are valued at $2.7 trillion, according to research firm XTF. Newer funds have pursued ever-more-specialized strategies, such as smart-beta ETFs, which base their portfolios on an index but tweak the weightings based on attributes such as value, growth or volatility.\n\nRead more of our premium in-depth coverage designed to help industry professionals monitor and act on decisions that influence policy.\n\n\n\nYet the SEC has never written rules specifically governing ETFs. These funds have to piggyback off regulations and laws written for mutual funds, which operate much differently. Currently, every new ETF must go through a process to seek exemptions from mutual-fund rules, including one that allows ETF shares to trade freely at market prices, instead of being bought and sold directly from a fund at net asset value.\n\nOn average, approval for new ETF sponsors has taken about one year, although firms that mimic existing or established fund strategies get approval more quickly\u2014usually within a month or two. The SEC takes longer to approve ETFs that are more complex or introduce features that the agency\u2019s staff hasn\u2019t seen before.\n\nAs a result, many fund companies want a comprehensive ETF rule that expedites approvals of more-routine strategies. The move could lower barriers to entry for newer firms trying to break into the market. Just three firms\u2014 BlackRock Inc., State Street Corp. \u2019s State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard Group\u2014manage 80% of ETF assets, according to XTF.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s acting chairman, Republican Michael Piwowar, has called for an expedited process to bring ETFs to market. Photo: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nIf the proposal is accepted, \u201cit will be a much faster process,\u201d says Amy Doberman, a partner at law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr LLP, whose work focuses on mutual funds and ETFs.\n\nThe rule would also allow the SEC to more closely examine\u2014and possibly clear\u2014more novel and risky products, says Dalia Blass, a lawyer at Ropes & Gray LLP who previously oversaw ETFs at the SEC.\n\nFor instance, a group of asset managers led by Precidian Investments wants to sell a new type of ETF that keeps its investments secret. Getting the SEC\u2019s blessing would probably allow a range of mutual-fund managers to repackage their products into ETFs without giving away their proprietary trading strategies to copycats.\n\nThe SEC has rejected the idea, saying it isn\u2019t convinced the product\u2014dubbed \u201cnontransparent\u201d by the industry\u2014can be effectively priced without disclosing its portfolio. Precidian declined to comment.\n\nJournal Report Podcast Subscribe to the Journal Report podcast at wsj.com, on iTunes or Google Play Music.\n\n\u201cThere are more-esoteric applications where perhaps time is better spent, than on those routine applications that could easily be codified\u201d by a regulation, Ms. Blass says.\n\nLong-running argument\n\nThe SEC examined changes to streamline the approval process in 2008, but shelved the plan in the wake of the financial crisis. Now those changes may have a powerful advocate in acting SEC chairman Michael Piwowar.\n\nTwo years ago, when he was a commissioner, Mr. Piwowar argued that the SEC \u201clong ago should have adopted a rule that would have allowed most ETFs to operate without the need for an exemptive order.\u201d The rule, he added, \u201cwould advance the commission\u2019s core mission, is sensible, would be a good use of commission resources and could be adopted in a short period of time.\u201d\n\nThe Investment Company Institute, a trade group of fund companies, prodded the SEC in August 2015 to reconsider the proposal, saying it would create a level playing field for all ETFs. The SEC hasn\u2019t disclosed if it plans to revisit the proposal.\n\nOne question is how strongly big ETF sponsors will back such an effort. The biggest firms, which already have approval for their products, would benefit less from a rule that makes it easier for competitors to launch. \u201cThere is no reason for large ETF sponsors to be pressing for a rule like this,\u201d says John McGuire, a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP who specializes in ETFs.\n\nA new proposal could also irk critics who believe there are already too many ETFs that can\u2019t recruit a big enough investor base. An SEC analysis following a wild trading session on Aug. 24, 2015, showed that ETFs that trade less often were more prone to extreme price swings that forced hundreds of trade halts on that day. SEC Commissioner Kara Stein, a Democrat, has said the agency hasn\u2019t focused enough on the downside of introducing so many new and complex products to exchanges that were designed for trading individual stocks.\n\nAsset managers have other policy goals in their sights that apply to mutual funds as well as ETFs. Last year, it failed to persuade regulators to allow funds to email annual reports to shareholders by default instead of sending booklets through the mail. The proposal sparked a lobbying war with paper manufacturers and some consumer groups, and the SEC maintained the status quo to avoid holding up a broader effort to increase the amount of information that funds provide to shareholders. The commission could vote on the measure again after it is back to its full slate of five commissioners, up from two currently.\n\n\u201cIt ought to be the model for the way we deliver information to shareholders,\u201d says Paul Schott Stevens, the ICI\u2019s chief executive. The group says moving to default electronic delivery would save $2 billion over a decade and allow fund sponsors to create a more-interactive document that could capture the attention of ordinary investors.\n\nAnother regulatory issue the industry is looking to resolve: rules that were written during the Obama administration but not approved.\n\nDemocrat Kara Stein at the SEC says the agency hasn\u2019t focused enough on the downside of new, complex products. Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News\n\nThe rules stem from an investigation by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, an umbrella group of regulators that can designate financial firms for stricter oversight by the Federal Reserve. The group studied whether big money managers at mutual funds could pose a risk to financial stability by stampeding into popular asset classes, reaching for yield or trying to boost returns with leverage or derivatives.\n\nThe council\u2019s focus on asset managers influenced a suite of rules that the SEC announced in 2014, such as one that requires managers to maintain a minimum percentage of easy-to-sell assets. The agency completed several of the rules, but some were left unfinished as a result of the November election and the departure of Mary Jo White as SEC chairman. The SEC\u2019s next permanent chairman could drop the unfinished rules, or alter them before approval.\n\nA controversial measure\n\nOne of them, a proposal that would codify an array of complex legal interpretations that govern how mutual funds and ETFs use derivatives, includes a controversial measure opposed by the fund industry. It would cap a fund\u2019s exposure to derivatives, setting the limit at 1\u00bd times a fund\u2019s net assets. Fund companies say derivatives can provide the same exposure to price or interest-rate moves as bonds, so a fixed limit is arbitrary and biased against funds that use products such as futures and swaps.\n\nMr. Piwowar, the acting SEC chief, voted against the plan when it was proposed in December 2015, saying the agency failed to justify the need for the limit.\n\nThe proposal appears unlikely to get final approval unless the agency removes the cap and simply focuses on providing more clarity around how funds should manage the risk posed by derivatives positions.\n\n\u201cI personally think a well-drawn-up rule on derivatives would be a good one,\u201d says Mr. Stevens of the ICI. \u201cThere has been so much talk about derivatives for so long. It would tie up a loose end, finish an agenda item and allow them to go on to something else.\u201d\n\nMutual funds and ETFs still have to implement other rules passed by the SEC last year, including the liquidity-management rule, intended to ensure funds can meet a surge of investor withdrawals. That measure also forces them to classify how long it would take to sell their holdings and requires them to disclose some of those metrics to shareholders.\n\n\u201cThe pace of additional regulation on the industry was absolutely relentless,\u201d Mr. Stevens says. \u201cOne priority would be to say, \u2018Let\u2019s think carefully about the need for and the nature of any further rules.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Michaels is a Wall Street Journal reporter in Washington.

And many of these sectors include stocks that pay dividends, an attraction when bond yields are so low. It has been a strong year for small-cap value mutual funds and those offering \u201cexposure to dividend-yielding parts of the market\u201d such as utilities and real estate, says Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund and ETF research at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The exchange opened to public visitors in 1939. Photo: Underwood Archives/Getty Images\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange was once a tourist mecca. From 1939 until roughly 15 years ago, crowds arrived daily for a glimpse of the bustling trading floor.\n\nBut since the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, the building and its exchange have been closed to the general public\u2014much to the dismay of many first-time visitors to New York. Though the NYSE, part of Intercontinental Exchange Inc., did consider reopening to the public at one point, a spokeswoman says it has no plans to do so in the immediate future.\n\nThe long closure has ended not only an option for tourists, but a chapter of Wall Street history. Gone are the days, for example, when anarchist Abbie Hoffman could walk up to the visitors area as he did in August 1967 and throw dollar bills to the trading floor below\u2014in what Mr. Hoffman described as a rebuke to capitalism. (Three months later, the exchange installed bulletproof glass in the visitors gallery.)\n\nVisitors can still enter the stock exchange if they can find an exchange member willing to sponsor their visit. According to a memo outlining the NYSE\u2019s rules of conduct, visitors must be at least 14 years old and on their best behavior. (The memo spells out hefty fines for traders who commit decorum infractions, including \u201cconsensual rough play or kidding around,\u201d \u201cuse of artificial noisemakers,\u201d \u201cpractical jokes\u201d and \u201crunning.\u201d Fireworks are also \u201cstrictly prohibited.\u201d)\n\nWithout an invitation, tourists have to make do with a view of the NYSE\u2019s neoclassical facade\u2014from beyond the black metal gate that wraps around the building\u2019s perimeter.\n\nThe New York Fed\u2019s gold vault, built in the basement during construction of the building in the early 1920s, is part of a free, public tour.

There are several possible destinations.\n\nOne is the Museum of American Finance, at 48 Wall St. Formerly a one-room gallery in the Standard Oil Building, a few blocks away, the museum moved in 2008 to accommodate more tourists, a spokeswoman says. The finance museum currently is showing an exhibit featuring the way gold influences our lives.\n\nSpeaking of gold, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is also in the neighborhood and offers guided tours. Learning about monetary policy is no Disney ride, but visitors may get a charge out of seeing the heavily guarded gold vault. In 2015, according to the bank\u2019s website, the vault stored about 508,000 ingots, weighing about 6,350 tons.\n\nFor those who like to walk, another possibility is the Wall Street Experience, a tour company that rarely takes clients inside any buildings\u2014except, occasionally, Federal Hall, where George Washington was inaugurated, a stone\u2019s throw from the NYSE. The tours instead offer insider perspectives of the financial industry, with historical asides.\n\nSome say that tourists aren\u2019t missing that much by the NYSE not reopening its doors. Trading today is a less-theatrical affair, notes Andrew Luan, founder of the Wall Street Experience and a former Deutsche Bank trader. The popular image of wildly gesticulating floor brokers shouting bids \u201cis a relic of how things used to be done,\u201d he says.\n\nFor a more tactile Wall Street experience, the curious often visit the \u201cCharging Bull\u201d sculpture in the park at Bowling Green.

They may think that different sectors might prosper under a different president, or that interest rates would be more or less likely to rise.\n\nBut here is something most investors don\u2019t realize: Research shows that their investment decisions will largely depend on simply whether their favorite candidate wins or loses.\n\nFor instance, if their favorite ends up in the Oval Office, they will tend to be more confident about the market and take on more portfolio risk. A loss, on the other hand, means that they will tend to opt for safer investments, as they expect the worst from the new administration.\n\nTheir choices aren\u2019t necessarily wrong. But they aren\u2019t based on objective analysis. Going with an unexamined gut instinct can lead people to make bad moves and capture lower returns\u2014or do serious damage to their portfolio, the researchers say.\n\nPostelection bias\n\nOne of the most important studies of political impact on investor behavior looked at the years 1991 through 2002, a period that encompasses three presidential-election cycles.\n\nThe study analyzed extensive survey data gathered by Gallup and the trading histories of more than 60,000 individual investors at a major brokerage firm. The researchers\u2014 Alok Kumar of the University of Miami, Jeremy Page of Brigham Young University and Yosef Bonaparte of the University of Colorado at Denver and director of that institution\u2019s Global Center for Political Finance\u2014controlled for all the major demographic factors, such as age, race, gender, education, and wealth and income level.\n\nThe findings: After the 1992 and 1996 elections, when the Democratic candidate won the presidency, Democratic voters tended to have greater confidence about the future of the economy than Republican voters. That confidence translated into their being willing to incur more portfolio risk, to favor the stocks of domestic over foreign companies and to trade less frequently. At the same time, Republicans were less confident about the economy and therefore tended to do the reverse of what Democratic voters did.\n\nWhen the Republican candidate won the 2000 election, the opposite pattern emerged: The Republican voters tended to incur more risk, favor domestic companies and trade less frequently.\n\nIn fact, the researchers\u2014whom I\u2019ve written about before\u2014found that both Republican and Democratic voters were guilty of letting their political beliefs and biases influence their investment choices. And the pattern has gotten stronger in the years since 2000 as the nation\u2019s political climate has grown more polarized, Prof. Bonaparte says.\n\nThe professors argue that the investors whose candidate lost are making a mistake when they trade more frequently, since that on average leads to a diminution in returns. But the researchers don\u2019t take a position on the merits of any of the other changes made by the investors in their study. The point, Prof. Bonaparte says, is that objectivity is difficult to maintain when we\u2019re gripped by partisan fervor.\n\n\u201cFor better or worse, investors are influenced by their political affiliation,\u201d Prof. Bonaparte says.\n\nThe pros do it, too\n\nThese findings don\u2019t apply only to individual investors. Investment professionals are also guilty of this behavior, according to a study by Jerry Parwada, a finance professor at the Australia Business School of the University of New South Wales, and Amanda Chin, one of Prof. Parwada\u2019s graduate students at the time of the study.\n\nTheir research focused on the behavior of institutional money managers in the months before the 2000 U.S. presidential election. They relied on publicly reported campaign contributions to determine the political affiliations of those managers, and on media reports to determine which stocks would likely do better or worse depending on whether the Republican candidate (George W. Bush) or the Democratic one (Al Gore) won.\n\nThe researchers found that, in the months leading up to that election, Democratic managers invested more heavily in stocks that supposedly would benefit if Mr. Gore were to win, while Republican managers invested more heavily in stocks that presumably would benefit from a Bush presidency. In other words, both sides let their partisan fervor guide their choices.\n\nWe probably shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by these findings, given the extensive research in the fields of psychology and other social sciences that document the difficulty of being truly objective in any area of life. Why should investors not face the same difficulties?\n\n\u2018When the political climate is aligned with their political identity, investors increase allocations to risky assets and exhibit a stronger preference for high market beta, small-cap, and value stocks.\u2019 \u2014From the study, \u2018Political Climate, Optimism, and Investment Decisions\u2019\n\nDan Ariely, a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University, said in an interview that \u201cwe know that people\u2019s decisions are very much colored by lots of things that are influencing their view of life.\u201d\n\nTom Gilovich, a psychology professor at Cornell University, points to studies showing Democrats and Republicans each claiming that the electoral map is biased against them, people thinking that their parents have been harder on them than on their siblings, and academics believing that they have a harder time with journal reviewers and tenure committees than colleagues in other disciplines. And sports fans of both teams in a contest, of course, often feel the referees and the announcers are biased against them.\n\nThe best way to counter the influence of biases on our decision making\u2014whether those biases arise from partisan political preference or something else entirely\u2014is to subject our analyses to the scrutiny of others, according to Richard Geist, president of the Institute of Psychology and Investing, and a former member of the psychiatry department at Harvard Medical School.\n\nDon\u2019t stand alone\n\n\u201cParticipating in an investment club is one way of doing that,\u201d he told me in an interview, \u201cbut you could also pick one or two colleagues by which you run your ideas, or subscribe to the newsletters or blogs of a few respected investment gurus.\u201d (And actually listening to the outsiders\u2019 views, rather than looking for any opportunity to disagree, is part of the equation, too.)\n\nBoth Republican and Democratic voters have been guilty of letting their political beliefs and biases influence their investment choices. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nRegardless of where the critical scrutiny comes from, however, Dr. Geist emphasizes that \u201cthe key thing to avoid is picking the club, colleagues or gurus simply because they agree with you; instead, you should pick them precisely because they may very well disagree with you.\u201d\n\nIf your investment ideas can withstand critical scrutiny from outsiders, then you can be more confident in pursuing them. But if they can\u2019t, you may want to think twice before betting heavily on them. And unpin the election button from your shirt before you start.\n\nMr. Hulbert is editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest and a senior columnist for MarketWatch.

Yes, many people in their 50s and beyond are making a serious mistake\u2014and it has nothing to do with money.\n\nSimply put, the majority of preretirees are focused solely on their financial health. Far too few are giving any thought to their physical health. And good physical health is crucial to making the most of later life.\n\nPut another way: A big nest egg isn\u2019t going to do you much good if you can\u2019t get off the couch.\n\nTo be specific: Only 42% of Americans ages 65 to 74\u2014and only 28% of those 75 and older\u2014meet government recommendations for aerobic activity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Center for Health Statistics. Worse, only 14% of the first group and just 8% of the second also do the suggested amount of strength training. (Be honest: Did you even know there are recommendations for strength training in later life?)\n\nExercise isn\u2019t just a good idea; it is critical to your well being, particularly as you age. A recent editorial in the Annals of Internal Medicine sums it up nicely: \u201cPeople who engage in physical activity have a lower risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, some types of cancer, depression, cognitive impairment and functional decline.\u201d\n\nIf you spend at least 150 minutes each week on moderate-intensity aerobic activity and do some type of muscle-strengthening activities two or more days a week\u2014congratulations. If not, start with the CDC\u2019s Physical Activity pages. It is the single-most-important step you can take as you approach retirement.\n\nI will turn 70 in June 2017. I want to take my first required minimum distribution from my IRA in the year I turn age 70. When is the earliest I can take the distribution and have it count as an RMD? Do I have to wait until after my June birthday, or can I take it as early as Jan. 2, 2017?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s clear up an important point: You must begin withdrawals from your IRA after you turn 70\u00bd\u2014not 70.\n\nIn this case, you will turn 70\u00bd in December 2017. That means you have until April 1, 2018, (your \u201crequired beginning date\u201d) to take your first required minimum distribution from your account. (A person\u2019s first RMD must be made by April 1 of the year after he or she reaches 70\u00bd.) But you certainly can act sooner than that, says Ed Slott, an IRA specialist in Rockville Centre, N.Y.\n\nThe year in which a person turns 70\u00bd is his or her first \u201cdistribution year.\u201d The first funds withdrawn from an IRA in a distribution year are automatically deemed (in the eyes of the Internal Revenue Service) to go toward satisfying a person\u2019s RMD for that year, Mr. Slott notes.\n\nSo\u2026as your question indicates, you can withdraw funds from your IRA as early as Jan. 2, 2017\u2014well before you turn 70\u00bd\u2014and that withdrawal will go toward meeting your first RMD.\n\n***\n\nI opened a health savings account for my family of three in 1997. I am 61 this year, my spouse is 55; our child is 21. My questions are mostly about what happens to the account when I become eligible for Medicare.\n\nWill the original HSA remain in my name? Will all the funds in the account be eligible only for paying medical expenses until my spouse reaches age 65 and our college student either reaches age 26 or gets other coverage? Will the two of them be able to continue using the account for medical expenses until then?\n\nAlmost 20 million Americans are enrolled in health savings accounts, according to America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a Washington, D.C.-based trade association, and many account holders will be dealing with these questions in the coming years.\n\nTo start, the original HSA will remain in your name. After you enroll in Medicare (typically, at age 65), you won\u2019t be able to make contributions to the account, but you will still be eligible to keep the account. As for using your HSA, account holders may always tap their HSA funds to pay qualified medical expenses for themselves, their spouse or their dependents tax-free, regardless of whether they are eligible to contribute to an HSA, says Paul Verberne, a principal at HSA Consulting Services in Houston. Indeed, you can use the account to pay such bills regardless of your age.\n\nThat said, it is important to note, Mr. Verberne adds, that the rules involving dependent children differ for health plans and health savings accounts. The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to make coverage available until a child reaches age 26. Eligibility to use HSA funds is more limited: The child must be under 19 years of age, or under 24 if a student. The child also must have the same principal residence as the account holder for more than half the year and must not provide more than half of his or her own support.\n\nFinally, once you turn 65, funds in the HSA may still be used to pay medical expenses tax-free for the account holder, spouse and qualified dependents. They also may now be used for anything else, much like an IRA. If not used for qualified medical expenses, the funds withdrawn are taxed as regular income.\n\nMr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal and co-author of \u201cThe Wall Street Journal Complete Retirement Guidebook.\u201d His column examines financial issues for those thinking about, planning and living their retirement.

What has surprised them in retirement?\n\nGood idea.\n\nLast month in this space, I wrote about some of the things that surprised my wife and me in our first year outside the office. (Among them: getting hit with a rash of unexpected bills and realizing that we were taking too many trips too quickly.) A reader in Texas responded with the suggestion above.\n\nSo, let me open the floor: What has surprised you in retirement? What did all the \u201cexperts\u201d (myself included) neglect to tell you? What would you tell would-be retirees to watch for? Your comments don\u2019t have to be about money (although many surprises in retirement seem to involve finances). And not all surprises in later life are bad surprises.\n\nFor instance, a reader in Georgia, in response to my original column, says he has been delightfully surprised by the changes in his life after he decided to take up cycling in retirement. The activity, writes Vern Zander, \u201chas enabled me to meet a broad range of fantastic people.\u201d It doesn\u2019t hurt, he adds, that cycling \u201calso keeps me healthy.\u201d\n\nAgain, we would enjoy hearing your thoughts.

My question: Can I change my Medigap policy during open enrollment?\n\nAsk a Question Have a question about planning for and living in retirement? Email askencore@wsj.com\n\nPREVIOUSLY IN ASK ENCORE\n\nYes, it\u2019s possible. But doing so can be tricky and expensive.\n\nDuring open enrollment, which runs from Oct. 15-Dec. 7 annually, Medicare beneficiaries can switch fairly easily, and without penalty, from one health plan to another\u2014say, from original Medicare to Medicare Advantage, or from one prescription-drug plan to a competing drug plan.\n\nBut Medicare Supplement Insurance, or Medigap, is a different creature. Such policies, which help pay bills that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover, are sold by private insurers and regulated primarily by individual states. Most important, Medigap plans have a unique enrollment period, one that you ignore at your peril.\n\nTo be specific: After you become eligible for Medicare and enroll in Medicare Part B (which covers doctors\u2019 services), the clock begins ticking on a six-month period in which you can buy a Medigap plan. During these six months, insurers are required to sell you a policy at the best available rate, regardless of your age or medical conditions. In short, you can\u2019t be denied coverage.\n\n(If you miss this period, \u201cguaranteed issue rights\u201d also can help get you in the Medigap door. See a full discussion of the rights in \u201cChoosing a Medigap Policy\u201d at medicare.gov.)\n\nThe point: If you enroll in a Medigap plan, or switch from one Medigap plan to another, outside the initial six-month window (or in the absence of guaranteed issue rights), you could run into problems. In such instances, insurers could charge you more, place restrictions on coverage (due to pre-existing conditions) or simply refuse to sell you a policy.\n\nAll that said, people do change their Medigap coverage. (Example: You might be paying for benefits that you don\u2019t need.) And the news isn\u2019t all bad. Some states are more generous than others when it comes to protected enrollment periods, and some insurers will work with beneficiaries who wish to switch plans.\n\nGiven that, start by contacting your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (shiptacenter.org) and your state insurance department (naic.org/state_web_map.htm) and ask about Medigap benefits and rules where you live.\n\nNote: Medicare, like Social Security, has become ridiculously complicated. Which makes a new book about the health-insurance program all the more valuable.\n\nTitled \u201cGet What\u2019s Yours for Medicare: Maximize Your Coverage, Minimize Your Costs\u201d and written by Philip Moeller, this comprehensive guide explains how the various pieces of Medicare work, walks you through the enrollment maze, discusses financial help and pitfalls, and helps you choose the best coverage for your circumstances. It should be required reading for everyone approaching age 65.\n\nThe cost-of-living adjustment in my Social Security benefits will total 0.3% in 2017. How will that affect my Medicare premiums next year?\n\nWe should find out this week, or soon after. The news will likely be a mixed bag.\n\nMost Medicare beneficiaries have their monthly premiums for Part B services automatically deducted from their Social Security benefits. Most of these individuals (about 70% of all beneficiaries) likely will see little or no increase in their current Part B premium of $104.90 a month, thanks to the Social Security Act\u2019s \u201chold harmless\u201d rule. Under this provision, the annual increase in a person\u2019s Medicare premiums can\u2019t be larger than the annual increase in his or her Social Security benefits.\n\nGiven a 0.3% cost-of-living adjustment in 2017 (a consequence of low inflation), the average monthly benefit for all retired workers will increase by only $5, according to the Social Security Administration. Translation: Medicare premiums for most individuals can\u2019t increase by more than that amount.\n\nBut the hold-harmless rule doesn\u2019t apply to several groups of beneficiaries and individuals, including people who first enroll in Medicare in 2017; those who are enrolled in Medicare but who aren\u2019t yet collecting Social Security benefits; and Medicare beneficiaries whose (large) incomes mean they are already paying bigger premiums for Part B. All these individuals, who account for about 30% of all Medicare beneficiaries, will likely see their Part B charges jump substantially in 2017.\n\nHow much? In a report published in June, Medicare trustees estimated that the current Part B premium of $121.80 a month (for those not held harmless) could rise to $149, an increase of 22%. Higher earners would pay more. For instance, a couple earning between $170,001 and $214,000 would see their monthly premiums climb to about $208 a person in 2017 from $170.50 this year.\n\nCongress could mitigate such increases for those beneficiaries not covered by the hold-harmless rule. (In fact, legislators did just that in late 2015, reducing what would have been a 52% premium increase in 2016 to 16%.) But Congress isn\u2019t scheduled to return to Washington until Nov. 14. That doesn\u2019t leave much time to act.\n\nLast year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced 2016 premiums and deductibles for Medicare Parts A and B on Nov. 10. With that in mind, we should see figures for 2017 any day. So\u2026stay tuned.\n\nMr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal, and co-author of \u201cThe Wall Street Journal Complete Retirement Guidebook.\u201d His column examines financial issues for those thinking about, planning and living their retirement.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/readers-emails-on-how-retirees-can-make-new-friends-1470621661", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nJoin a gym, take up pickleball, travel\u2014don\u2019t just travel, move\u2014don\u2019t be shy, get a dog!\n\nThose are some of the suggestions Wall Street Journal readers sent us in response to a recent Ask Encore column in which a California retiree asked for ideas on how to find new friends in later life. Our follow-up column talks about the responses, but for those who want to read many of the actual letters in detail, what follows is an edited sampling of the more than 200 emails we received.\n\n***\n\nYour correspondent is right in saying it\u2019s more difficult to make friends after one is retired. I have found that you must take the initiative.\n\nFor example, in both my exercise and academic classes, I have been the one to suggest a coffee date. I\u2019ve made new friends this way.\n\nMost people are eager to expand their network of friends and acquaintances, especially if they\u2019re retired and their social world is shrinking through friends\u2019 relocation and death.\n\n***\n\nHaving just moved to New York City, I can relate to this dilemma. Here are some ideas:\n\n\u2014Join any alumni club that might be available (or organize one if it does not exist).\n\n\u2014Start attending a class at a yoga studio or similar activity. With regular attendance, you may find a friend or two.\n\n\u2014Participate in a learning activity.\n\n\u2014Become involved in a club by attending events and volunteering on committees.\n\nMost of all, I say that making new friends as we age requires us to be willing to kiss many frogs\u2026until a few turn into princely friends. It is a labor-intensive process that demands flexibility, openness and the willingness to put ourselves out there!\n\n***\n\nDance! Dancers are, for the most part, nice, friendly people. With military experience, if you can march, you can dance. Without a partner, there\u2019s folk dancing and line dancing. Ethnic societies may have folk-dance sessions. Bars and senior centers may have line-dance activities. What could be nicer than staying fit and meeting a lot of nice people? There are some who are particular about how well another dances, but most dancers are happy to \u201cdance like nobody\u2019s looking.\u201d\n\n***\n\nMy recommendation is to join a gym and establish a regular workout routine. You\u2019ll see many of the same people every day, and it\u2019s relatively easy to strike up a conversation. In addition, the exercise is good for your health.\n\nI\u2019ve met many people at my gym, both male and female. I know I can choose to go work out and never look at or speak with anyone else. Most people do this, and I am in this category very often myself: stick to myself, get the job done, etc. However, over time I\u2019ve come to realize that\u2014with almost every person I know at the gym\u2014I made the effort to introduce myself and say hello to them first. Most people are shy or, for whatever reason, won't speak to a stranger first. But if you open the door, many people will respond.\n\nThe good thing is, now\u2014even though I focus primarily on working out\u2014I am on friendly terms with quite a few people there. And I know I could always make the effort to expand on those relationships if I wanted to increase my circle of friends: by arranging to meet at the gym at the same time, or getting a coffee after working out, or asking for guidance on using a machine that I\u2019m not familiar with, etc. It\u2019s a good feeling, and my workouts now provide social interaction, which I never had before.\n\n***\n\nWhen I retired, I moved to a new city near a beach (bucket-list desire), bought a different house (Victorian, also on the bucket list), and determined to try all kinds of things I had never tried before, or had loved doing long ago when I was young.\n\nI volunteered for the Art League; the homeowners\u2019 organization where my house was; the Historic Foundation, which offered Saturday classes in how to renovate your historic house (and did research on my own); stopped by a church denomination I had never visited (not much of a churchgoer); gave a lecture or two at Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes; joined Osher and tried out some of the classes they offered; joined a photography club and took workshops; competed at local art competitions with my photographs and won an occasional award; worked as a docent at historic-house festivals; served as the landmark representative for my district; traveled to many places I had always wanted to visit, alone and on cruises/with groups; etc.\n\nI also joined a wine-tasting club, which had monthly meetings, largely social; other Meetups (many cities have them); attended monthly bring-a-dish neighborhood dinners\u2014and met a lot of new friends, some in my neighborhood, some not.\n\nAsk a Question Have a question about planning for and living in retirement? Email askencore@wsj.com\n\nAlso, I never stopped doing what I had always loved doing, that is, writing articles and books, lecturing, and going to conferences. So I maintained friendships I always had had. I am a grandmother (by the way) with three grown children and five grandchildren, all of whom are scattered around the country and whom I see twice a year or so.\n\nSo my advice is: try new things, talk to total strangers while walking your dog (or get a dog!), keep doing what you love to do, travel\u2014and most of all, love living, one day at a time. You will meet many people. You don\u2019t have to like all of them. Keep up with the best friends you have. It\u2019s an adventure!\n\n***\n\nI certainly can relate to the retiree\u2019s quest for friends; I retired about a year ago from a demanding career that didn\u2019t allow much extracurricular time for nourishing friendships. Since retiring, I have found friends at the local Y; I find retirees mostly work out in the morning. Taking classes (yoga, Pilates) is the best way to start conversations and get to know people. I have pursued hobbies and other interests as well, but the hardest part of making friends is being vulnerable and \u201cputting yourself out there.\u201d Being somewhat of an introvert, I have to make myself attend social occasions so I have an opportunity to meet new people. I keep a reminder on my refrigerator: \u201cLife begins at the end of your comfort zone.\u201d\n\n***\n\nMy wife and I volunteer with the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program; doing income taxes for others makes the winter fly by. But when April 15 comes around, I\u2019m looking on the American Volkssport Association website (ava.org) for hikes and walks. If your retiree likes to travel, there are a lot of regional events put on by local clubs, and there are always singles there. We just returned from a fantastic set of walks in the Columbia River Gorge in Oregon. There are walks in every state of varying length (most are 5 or 10k) and difficulty. The AVA advertises they are for Fitness, Fun, and Fellowship (the unadvertised fourth \u201cF\u201d is for FOOD). The walks are all at your own pace, and we\u2019ve met wonderful folks from all walks of life\u2026and most are retired.\n\n***\n\nI recommend going to camp!\n\nI moved to a new city in my mid-50s to go to law school. Which I did. Then I had friends from law school. How quickly we drifted apart!\n\nBut I love to knit. So I heard about a knitting camp and went. Didn\u2019t know anyone there. We shared cabins (townhouses) and knit together in the evenings over copious bottles of wine. I have remained friends with some of these people for so many years!\n\nThen I started machine knitting. I signed up for camp. Great fun. Lovely people. I feel safe and have laughter-filled days and evenings.\n\n***\n\nI am a 72-year-old retired corporate lawyer. My wife of 50-plus years died earlier this year. My advice, gleaned from the advice of friends in my age group who are also single, either through divorce or the death of a spouse or significant other, is to get very involved in activities you love. For example, I play the guitar. I\u2019m not only involved in a local guitar ensemble that plays music in our community every two weeks, but I also belong to a number of internet groups of guitarists and communicate with guitarists, via these forums, all over the world on a daily basis. Great therapy for loneliness.\n\n***\n\nI highly recommend that retirees with the right experience and gifts look into becoming CASAs: Court Appointed Special Advocates for children who are abused, neglected, abandoned, or in difficult custody situations. You will meet other CASAs and serve the most-desperately needy children as a trained volunteer.\n\nAfter retiring I moved to Virginia (five years ago). I took a year off to baby-sit the grandkids (boring) but got involved in an Episcopal church\u2019s food pantry, book club, and various programs around town, like the civic league. Then I went back to work part time, being a math teacher this time after 30-something years of teaching English. I have never loved a job so much, and four of my new colleagues and I have become great outside-work friends for the past four years.\n\nMy best advice for making new friends after retirement: volunteer and, if you can, get a paid part-time job. Moving to a new area brings lots of new friends.\n\n***\n\nGet involved in the world of social dancing, which includes contra dancing, traditional square dancing, English country dancing, Irish set dancing, and much, much more. This is not competitive dancing like \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d on TV; it\u2019s totally different. Social dancing is the place to meet men and women of all ages (we have a guy in our crowd who\u2019s 85, and a woman who\u2019s 84, plus teenagers and everything in between) who enjoy moving in time to good music. You don\u2019t need to bring your own partner\u2014just happy feet, a smile, and you\u2019ll learn the rest at your own pace while having fun.\n\nAlso, learn a new skill, such as bird-watching or a simple sport such as bocce ball. Join a bowling league, or a book club.\n\nTake a class about something you\u2019re curious about at the local library or the Y. Such classes usually aren\u2019t very expensive and run for short periods, and will put you in the midst of people who might also want to make new friends.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t already on Facebook, sign up and look for groups that include your present hobbies.\n\nWhatever you do, let folks know that you are interested in expanding your social life, and be prepared to say something along the lines of, \u201cWould anyone like to go out for ice cream afterward?\u201d You have to reach out first, and maybe more than once, but keep on asking!\n\n***\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to go to events alone! Go to eat alone in casual restaurants, too. Push yourself out of your comfort zone! I\u2019m a widow, and my social life is wonderful.\n\nI\u2019ve met new people at the ballet, at lectures at the historical society, at programs at the library, at book readings in bookstores, at the theater (matinee), at the local coffee shop\u2026.\n\nBe friendly and polite, not overbearing. Be a good listener. Ask people questions ABOUT THEMSELVES. (It\u2019s not about you!) If you and your new acquaintance decide on a follow-up meeting, be flexible and accommodating.\n\nBe generous. Don\u2019t quibble over nickels and dimes. You won\u2019t find every conversation fascinating. That\u2019s OK. Smile. Be patient. Don\u2019t be argumentative and confrontational. Don\u2019t brag and compete. Be kind and thoughtful\u2026and the invitations will come.\n\n***\n\nI moved to the East Coast from the West Coast for family reasons a number of years ago. Making new friends outside of family members was challenging.\n\nI started taking Road Scholar trips (formerly Elderhostel) both to follow pursuits I enjoy and to be with others with shared interests. On one hiking, biking, and kayaking trip I exchanged emails with others in the group at the end. To my surprise, one woman, who lives about 50 minutes from me, wrote later to find out if I was interested in riding one of the trails in our region. She and I began riding the regional trails on a regular basis, kayaking in some of the area waterways, and going on various group walks and hikes. We have become close friends, and I count myself lucky to have one true friend here, having left all my closest friends behind in the West.\n\nA key benefit of such programs as Road Scholar is the ability to spend a week or so in close contact with people of similar interests, allowing time to get to know fellow travelers more deeply and thus opening the door to continued friendships.\n\n***\n\nWhile not for everyone, what worked for us was moving to an over-55 community while it was still in development. In our area of the development there were multiple neighbors who had purchased their homes within the past year and were interested in finding new friends. In addition, the clubhouse has a very active social program\u2014dances and concerts, plus trivia, card games, pool tournaments and much more. Or you can get involved in running the homeowners association.\n\n***\n\nIf you were ever in a sorority or fraternity, join the local alumni chapter, even if it has been many years since you were involved. They will be glad to have you and you will find many people with a common bond and similar values. That\u2019s a nice way to meet people of all ages, which I find refreshing. They might not be my regular friends, but seeing a variety of people makes life more interesting.\n\nBe willing to lead something. Get involved and contribute (a club, volunteer, your homeowners association, etc.). You will meet people you wouldn\u2019t have known otherwise. Don\u2019t sit back and wait because \u201cthey\u201d might never discover you.\n\nIf you attend church, join a Bible study. Be willing to open up and share: some of my most caring friends were found this way.\n\n***\n\nCheck out Meetup.com. The name of the website may be mildly off-putting, but I can attest to the fact that these groups are a fantastic way to meet people. I joined a group that meets to speak French; several Meetups are set each week, for lunch, coffee, a French movie. I told a friend about Meetup, and she joined a group that goes to independent films.\n\nGroups typically meet in public places, and my experience has been that people are very open. You won\u2019t click with everyone in the group, but you will likely find one or two prospective friends\u2014and the next get-together is set by the group, so it\u2019s easier to get a new friendship rolling.\n\n***\n\nEating lunch at the same local place is a good way to meet others in your area. Get there first and ask another regular patron to join you.\n\nSee what your local art museum has to offer in the way of classes. This could be the opening for a new hobby as well as a way to meet others. Also there are opportunities for volunteer work at the museums. Exhibit openings offer chances to meet new friends. Our museum often has day trips to other exhibits in larger towns.\n\nA club in town has an \u201copen mic\u201d night every week where local musicians play all kinds of music. The attendees range in age from 5 to 85. The music is almost as varied. I have made a lot of interesting friends and look forward to it every week. As I am not a drinker, yet want to patronize the place, I buy some of the musicians drinks.\n\n***\n\nI am 72 also. The simple answer is, ENGAGE. And this is how I do it:\n\n\u2014I\u2019m a geriatric-patient mentor for students at the local medical school. It\u2019s a blast.\n\n\u2014I started playing bridge. It has opened new vistas, requiring mental and social interaction.\n\n\u2014I take noncredit classes at the local university: on mathematics, astronomy, the Constitution.\n\n\u2014I attend film-society movies.\n\n\u2014I am finishing my third book, but you can write a letter to the editor, a story, or essay.\n\n\u2014Don\u2019t forget exercise: I swim a mile every day. Choose what you like to do.\n\nBottom line, don\u2019t become a curmudgeon, whom no one wants to be around. And start having all the fun your kids are having because they don\u2019t have any student loans to pay back. (You paid for their education!)\n\n***\n\nMy idea is a little outside the box, but I think could offer a lot of possibilities if the reader has an open mind. I would suggest going abroad, living abroad or traveling for a while. So, why not find a group that likes to travel\u2014or heck, just go alone. He could rent an apartment for a few months (or a year), and if he likes it could move there permanently. Or, he could join an online community and connect with people in another country who want to learn English, and then do weekly Skype calls. Or go abroad and teach English. If that idea is too bold, I would also suggest moving to another place in the U.S. for a year.\n\nBasically, anything that involves getting OUT OF HIS COMFORT ZONE! He needs to shake it up, try something new and realize the possibilities are endless if you have an open mind.\n\n***\n\nIn answer to the 72-year-old who can\u2019t seem to make friends, we say move to a CCRC right away. Continuing Care Retirement Communities (also called Life Plan Communities) provide all the levels of care so that a resident knows that he/she will never have to move again. Because of this permanency, all the residents are interested in making new friends because they are assured they will be lifelong friends.\n\nAnd don\u2019t say, \u201cI\u2019m too young to live there.\u201d That\u2019s like saying, \u201cI\u2019m too young to go on vacation.\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m too young to stay in a resort.\u201d CCRC life is the most fun you\u2019ve ever had. As soon as I turned 62 (the minimum age) we moved into our own cottage in an incredibly lovely parklike CCRC with breathtaking views, and we never regretted it for a moment. Here, we have over 100 activities/clubs/groups for our 1,000 residents\u2014everything from the standard tennis, golf, bridge and bocce, to the pool, the gyms, the art studio, the jewelry-making workshop, the play-reading group, the wood shop, the chorus, the band, the weavers, the hiking/biking groups, the gardeners, the ham-radio operators. You name it, we\u2019ve got it. And, if we don\u2019t have it, there\u2019s always support for you to start your own new group.\n\nWhen you are in any group here, you always make new friends because you are sharing interests and learning together how to enjoy your new lifestyle. Also, it\u2019s so easy to entertain: ask your new friends to drop by for a glass of wine or a cup of tea and then take free campus transportation to all go up and dine together in one of several dining venues. No cooking, no dishes. Or arrange to go together to the many evening entertainments on campus.\n\nWe are quiet people, introverts you could say, and we have made countless good friends here. You can\u2019t fail to do the same.\n\n***\n\nYour reader may want to join a men\u2019s breakfast group. Asking friends about these groups is quite easy. If he doesn\u2019t find an established group that he can fit into\u2026start one.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be choosy. Try to interest three or four other men to join him once a week for breakfast. It is amazing how many men relish this activity. Soon the initial small group will expand as each member asks new people to join. It is not important that new members may be a stranger to some. Everyone will get to know one another over a short time.\n\nI am in a group that numbers 21 men. In the summer we often have 17-18 for breakfast, always in a familiar restaurant. Winter numbers shrink to sometimes only to three or four due to snowbirds fleeing to Florida. Several of us socialize at other times now that we\u2019ve made friends with each other. It has become a tremendous way to meet new people in a no-stress atmosphere.\n\nWe have about five or six restaurants we rotate to. The waitresses get to know us and each week we decide which place for the next week and someone gives them a heads-up so it isn\u2019t a surprise when a horde descends upon them. We meet every Wednesday at 8 a.m. and order at 8:30. This gives stragglers time to get there and still order at the same time. One of our members keeps a spreadsheet of names, email address, phone, home address, spouse, etc., which makes contacting each other simple.\n\n***\n\nMy suggestions:\n\n\u2014Relocate to a target-rich environment. By this I mean moving to a place where there are a lot of people at the same stage of life. This can be as simple as moving to a Del Webb-like community or some other retiree-dense community.\n\n\u2014Underinvest in housing. Unless money is no constraint, there is no reason to own a 4,000-square-foot pocket mansion. This leaves more assets to produce cash flow to go out and do fun stuff.\n\n\u2014Get a significant other: Your chances of meeting another couple with similar interests doubles. In addition, almost everything we do is couples-based. There are a few exceptions where singles join in, but it is rare.\n\n\u2014Print up some calling cards and distribute them to everyone you meet. It may be old-fashioned, but it leaves a tangible reminder with the person you met that they should reconnect with you. Put something clever on the back of the card: your picture, your interests, etc.\n\n\u2014Play offense. Don\u2019t sit around and wait for the phone to ring. Pick up the phone and contact other people you met to plan an outing. Initiate contact. This can be as simple as dinner at your house or as complex as a backpacking trip to a national park.\n\n\u2014Host at least one charitable function every year. Buy a table at the local hospital/Boy Scouts/symphony fundraiser and invite people you have met and want to get to know better. That act of kindness and generosity is remembered and reciprocal invitations will follow.\n\n\u2014Find an endeavor that will keep you in contact with millennials. As frustrating as they may be, they are a curious and entertaining breed. You will learn something from them and they will benefit from your experience, as well. It will give you hope that the situation is not as dire as the news portrays.\n\n\u2014Don't allow yourself to become a couch potato. Get involved in a group activity: bridge, golf, hiking, biking, etc. More than one is better.\n\n***\n\nAlthough this isn\u2019t the answer for everyone, if you like cars, if you like to have fun, and if you like to make new friends, then buy a new or used Mazda Miata and join one of the many Miata car clubs around the country.\n\nI did this 10 years ago and have made carloads of new best friends. Our club has dinners, drives, lunch runs, trips and more. No mechanical expertise, racing experience or large bankroll required\u2026just a smile!\n\n***\n\nOrganize a high-school reunion or attend a college reunion. Once you\u2019ve attended one of these events, keep in touch with people whose company you particularly enjoyed. I chaired my high-school reunion last July, and last month attended an all-class reunion of my high school. Our class (1970) was the youngest group of people there. One of the men from the class of 1967 asked me out on a date for that very evening. Now, some of us are planning to go to a swing-dancing evening near our old high school.\n\nReach out to relatives you don\u2019t often see. Meet them for lunch or dinner. Plan a family reunion. If it\u2019s too hard to do it in your own home, choose a centrally located restaurant and plan a luncheon. Later this month, I\u2019m having a two-day \u201ccousins\u201d reunion at my house. Saturday will be my mother\u2019s side of the family and Sunday will be my dad\u2019s side. Both of my sisters are flying in for the weekend and we are also going to squeeze in a mini \u201csurprise\u201d baby shower for my daughter who is due Dec. 7.\n\nGet a dog and walk it in your neighborhood or at a local park. Smile and chat with passersby. One of my best friends is a woman I met about 17 years ago when our dogs were puppies. We were in the habit of walking a nearby lake at 7 a.m. each day, and we just began walking together. The dogs are now gone, but our friendship has endured.\n\n***\n\nTry everything! Drop anything you don\u2019t enjoy, even if it\u2019s a good cause. You will only enjoy the people who enjoy the same things you do\u2026photography, duplicate bridge, painting, a writers club, dancing, hiking, cooking. Take short courses on anything. Don\u2019t tie yourself down to a semester in history. You\u2019ve just started your treasure hunt.\n\n***\n\nI recommend a multipronged strategy:\n\n\u2014Learn how to play an instrument. If you don\u2019t already know how, then join a church orchestra or community band. Daily practice, periodic rehearsals, and then performances will keep you engaged with people and exercise your brain. Plus, in churches, you\u2019ll get exposed to many other activities.\n\n\u2014Start writing real letters to everyone. Then for those who reply, go visit them in person. Travel isn\u2019t just leisure, because staying in motion is critical to staying alive.\n\n\u2014Talk to strangers. Take initiative to meet people. But don\u2019t do it in an overbearing way. Just get in the habit, be patient, and see what opens up.\n\n\u2014Start attending church. All you have to do is just sit there. The Divinity will see that you are there and start to work.\n\n***\n\nMy advice is to move to an active adult community. Most states have them and they come in various configurations, but I would suggest one with a full-time activities director.\n\nMy partner and I met late in life and had the opposite problem; we had single friends, but no couple friends. We tried the volunteer route, but most volunteer assignments seemed to be task-oriented: you showed up, you completed your task, and went home, so no real relationships formed.\n\nWe moved to an active adult community two years ago and have formed close friendships with five other couples and know at least 200 people to call by name. We have a robust singles group, 45 interest groups, a strong fitness/wellness program, and we are self-governing so there are numerous committees to join.\n\nThe first year we basically joined everything, but over time we have become more selective. It is really nice having a built-in peer group.\n\n***\n\nAlways carry a small date notebook in your back pocket or purse. When someone suggests doing something in the future, whip out your date notebook and set a date. Yeah, I know: Smartphones do the same thing. But the little notebook seems to work best for getting a commitment.\n\n***\n\nIn most areas of the U.S., there is a need for court mediators. You don't need to be an attorney, and in most cases you can become one quickly and without a large investment. In many jurisdictions, these positions are paid.\n\nMy mediation experience also helped me win a small-claims case worth several thousand dollars against an insurance company. Frankly, without the experience I received as a mediator, I would not have initiated the lawsuit.\n\nIf you have business experience, SCORE, a nationwide nonprofit organization that counsels America\u2019s small-business owners, is always looking for volunteers. Many SCORE volunteers are still in the workforce, and you will make many useful contacts that can result in paid employment opportunities. If you wish, you can make formal presentations to business owners on various related subjects. This experience can lead to job opportunities at local colleges as well.\n\nYou can volunteer for a State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP). These exist in every state and assist the general public with Medicare and Medicaid issues. The training you receive and the experience you gain will assist you with your own insurance issues.\n\nOne significant advantage of volunteering is that you greatly expand your contacts, which can result in leads to employment opportunities. I have found that the individuals who stay the busiest in retirement, whether it involves part-time work or volunteering, are among the most satisfied with their lives.\n\n***\n\nWe moved to Florida recently and were looking to make new friends. We discovered the sport of pickleball at our local park and found the game to be fun, challenging and the most social game we\u2019ve ever played.\n\nActually it\u2019s intended to be a social game as, at most courts, you simply show up and you are paired in a group of four to play a match. The next matches you play with different folks throughout the day. There is lots of time to talk and get to know people who were complete strangers just earlier in the day.\n\nI would suggest checking local parks, tennis clubs and community centers to see if they offer drop-in pickleball play. Oh by the way: The cost is generally $3 to play for 3 hours!!\n\n***\n\nThis may sound like an off-the-wall suggestion, but it is a completely sincere \u201cplug\u201d for joining your local mushroom club. Mushrooms appeal to a wide variety of interests: walking in the woods, scientific study, photography, cooking, or just attending presentations and classes. I highly recommend it.\n\nFor a list of mushroom clubs, go to: http://www.namyco.org/clubs.php\n\n***\n\nIn retirement, I have found these things to work:\n\n\u2014Be a good friend and others will enjoy being with you. No gossip, bad-mouthing of others, including spouses, daughters-in-law.\n\n\u2014No \u201corgan recitals.\u201d (That\u2019s what my mom called it when people talked about their body parts, pills, doctor appointments and surgeries.)\n\n\u2014Stay healthy and you will attract healthy friends. This includes physically (work out at the gym or walk daily), emotionally (don\u2019t be a heavy drinker or use other drugs), mentally (read a lot, go to lectures, take classes, play an instrument, etc.) and spiritually (get involved in church, help others in some way each day).\n\n\u2014Don\u2019t cling. If someone doesn\u2019t return your call, that\u2019s their answer.\n\n\u2014Conversation starters. I have met people at the recreation center by wearing a T-shirt that had my college sorority letters on it, or St. Francis, KS, on it. People ask about a T-shirt. I never wear a political T-shirt, or anything controversial.\n\n\u2014Carrying my violin is always a conversation starter. I met a retired couple on the shuttle at Denver International Airport last month who live in the Denver area and are musicians. We had a great 10-minute visit and have seen them here at a concert since we all got back.\n\n\u2014Gather one friend at a time. Be gentle. Smile. Make one comment, then wait and see if they respond. Don\u2019t dominate the conversation. Don\u2019t expect them to be a best friend. Invite them to something you both enjoy, and limit the time.\n\n\u2014Pay your own way. If someone else drives, be generous and pay for gas or pay for his or her lunch. Don\u2019t mooch.\n\n\u2014I keep lots of friends by trying to help everyone to have a good time. My mother taught me this. She was a \u201cfriend keeper\u201d through letters and phone calls.\n\nMr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal, and co-author of \u201cThe Wall Street Journal Complete Retirement Guidebook.\u201d His column examines financial issues for those thinking about, planning and living their retirement.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gold-and-silver-dominate-the-etf-charts-1470621723", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Silver is precious, but gets a benefit from its industrial uses. Photo: Akos Stiller/Bloomberg News\n\nIt has been a golden year for precious-metal ETFs.\n\nThis year\u2019s top 10 nonleveraged ETFs by returns through July are focused on gold and silver, with all of them up at least 100% since the start of 2016, according to data from ETFdb.com, a site that provides information and analysis of the market. (Nonleveraged funds don\u2019t use derivatives or borrowed money as part of their investment strategy.)\n\nThe funds take varying approaches, but they invest in mining companies. The top spot is held by PureFunds ISE Junior Silver (SILJ), which rose more than 250% through July. At the beginning of the year, it had assets under management of about $3.5 million, according to PureFunds Chief Executive Andrew Chanin, meaning the fund was costing more to run than it was generating in revenue. Its assets now exceed $91 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a wild year,\u201d says Mr. Chanin. \u201cThere were people who were trying to advise me to close the fund down last year. I had absolutely no interest in seeing that happen.\u201d\n\nThe success of the mining ETFs is directly linked with the rise of gold and silver prices, which have bounced back strongly after a multiyear bear run. Gold is up 27% this year, and silver 44%.\n\nBond refugees\n\nThere are a number of reasons for this resurgence. First, investors see the metals\u2014particularly gold\u2014as a safe-haven asset in volatile financial markets, says Jay Jacobs, director of research at Global X, which runs the Gold Explorers (GLDX) and Silver Miners (SIL) ETFs. He points to volatility in the early part of the year when oil prices fell below $30 a barrel, and in June following the U.K.\u2019s vote to leave the European Union.\n\nBut there is also a more unusual reason investors are seeking out these assets. Gold and silver historically have kept pace with inflation, but don\u2019t pay any income, so many investors turn to government bonds instead for inflation protection. In these times of rock-bottom interest rates, gold in particular is looking more attractive, says John Ciampaglia, executive vice president and head of ETFs at Sprott, which manages the Sprott Junior Gold Miners (SGDJ) and Sprott Gold Miners (SGDM) ETFs.\n\n\u201cThe amount of capital that is now looking for more-attractive alternatives [to bonds] is really quite staggering,\u201d Mr. Ciampaglia says. \u201cGold has been a big beneficiary.\u201d\n\nSome silver funds, though, have done even better this year. The three top-performing nonleveraged ETFs through July focus on silver. Silver gets a boost from its industrial uses, says Kiril Nikolaev, a financial analyst at ETFdb.com. He points to its use in solar panels as an example.\n\n\u201cMore and more people are getting solar panels on their rooftops, which is increasing their demand. This in turn has some effect on the price of silver itself,\u201d Mr. Nikolaev says.\n\nWhy invest in a mining company, rather than simply buying the metal itself? One reason is that the companies\u2019 profits have the potential to provide a bigger return. The miners tend to have fixed operating costs, so they remain the same no matter the price of the metal. That means profits can rise exponentially, says Mr. Jacobs. \u201cAs that commodity starts to rally, you can see the performance of these companies start to take off at a much faster rate than actually the underlying commodity.\u201d\n\nAlso, investors in miners can benefit from the companies\u2019 management, says Tushar Yadava, vice president on the U.S. investment strategy team at BlackRock \u2019s iShares, whose iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners (SLVP) and iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners (RING) ETFs are both among the top 10 nonleveraged ETFs this year.\n\n\u201cWhen you invest in the equities, you\u2019re getting a company as well, so you\u2019re getting the ability to maneuver,\u201d Mr. Yadava says. \u201cWhen the outlook is getting a little weaker, they can cut costs and close some operations, which is what happened when gold was not doing so great.\u201d\n\nStock-market risk\n\nMiners usually outperform the underlying commodity, says Brandon Rakszawski, product manager at VanEck, which runs the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) and VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX). However, they can also underperform when things get rough.\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, as gold prices have risen\u2014and this has played out this year\u2014gold miners have risen to a greater magnitude. And when gold prices have fallen, sometimes gold miners have fallen harder,\u201d he says.\n\nHe adds that investors should remember they\u2019re still investing in stocks, so there is a general market risk. \u201cThese gold miners are not impacted by gold price and gold price only,\u201d Mr. Rakszawski says. \u201cThere are certain macroeconomic and market risks that can influence general equities across the board, and gold miners are no exception.\u201d\n\nMr. Cowan is a writer in London.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-concerns-and-the-trump-administration-1488856081", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "GERALD SEIB | \u2018There\u2019s going to be a pivot toward bilateral away from multilateral free-trade agreements.\u2019 Photo: Nikki Ritcher/Dow Jones\n\nThe Trump election represents an upheaval on the political scene. There are many aspects to the presidency that are going to affect business. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s John Bussey spoke with Gerald Seib, chief political commentator for the Journal and executive Washington editor, about the impact of President Donald Trump and his policies on a wide range of issues important to the tech community. Edited excerpts follow.\n\nMR. BUSSEY: There are a number of aspects of policy that are going to affect companies in general and CIOs and the tech world in particular.\n\nImmigration, what are we going to expect? There was a new iteration of executive orders that we\u2019re expecting out today that would exempt past visa holders but apply to future visa holders from those seven countries. This thing is still in the works. And a lot of these folks count on a lot of those visas to man their staffs. So what should we expect from immigration policy?\n\nMR. SEIB: Well, first of all, just a couple things to say as backdrop before I answer that directly. The last year and a half has been an exercise in humility. If you\u2019ve been around, you think you know what\u2019s going to happen next. You\u2019ve been proven wrong.\n\nHaving been there before doesn\u2019t guarantee that you know anything. And I\u2019ve learned that.\n\nThat\u2019s the first thing. Second thing is, on a broader scale, there\u2019s a kind of a disconnect between the Trump administration and the tech community.\n\nTech is basically about breaking down borders and creating globalization, because it\u2019s inevitable. And the Trump administration is about strengthening borders and trying to pull back globalization. So I think that there\u2019s always going to be tension there. And it starts with a topic you raised, immigration.\n\nThey haven\u2019t gotten to the issue that\u2019s of importance to people in this room, which is legal immigration, H-1B visas. And I think there\u2019s a giant misunderstanding.\n\nI think that people don\u2019t understand that the Trump agenda on immigration is that he expressed in the campaign a desire to pull back on the number of H-1B visas and the way the program is executed.\n\nAnd then when he met with tech executives in Trump Tower just before the inaugural, he said essentially the opposite. \u201cWell, let\u2019s talk about how we can deal with that if that\u2019s a problem.\u201d So I don\u2019t think there is on this subject, like so many right now, very clear signals. But I do believe that eventually the question of legal immigration and attempts to pull it in is going to be on the table. And I think that\u2019s going to be a moment of some tension.\n\nProtecting data\n\nMR. BUSSEY: Cybersecurity?\n\nMR. SEIB: Rudy Giuliani has been given some kind of a commission from the president to form a commission. A private-sector commission that\u2019s going to advise the government on how to deal with cybersecurity.\n\nAt the same time, internally in the early days of the administration, somebody wrote a draft of an executive order on cybersecurity. The White House scheduled a day for the president to sign this executive order. It was going to be Jan. 30.\n\nThen it canceled the signing, and pulled the executive order back, and never really explained why. And it\u2019s kind of in limbo somewhere. Somewhere along the way, there was a conversation evolving. The president and [his senior adviser and son-in-law] Jared Kushner, Defense Secretary Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary Kelly.\n\nI do think that the first attempt to deal with cybersecurity is going to be an attempt to tighten up cybersecurity in the government sphere, and then figure out how that moves into the private sector at the same time. But that\u2019s kind of up in the air a little bit.\n\nMR. BUSSEY: Net neutrality?\n\nMR. SEIB: I think that you have to assume that there is going to be a pullback on net neutrality, that Ajit Pai, the new FCC commissioner who has been appointed by the president, is not a fan of net neutrality.\n\nI think that there is going to be some pullback, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be a complete reversal. There\u2019s also a question of whether the Republican-controlled Congress wants to commit into law ideas that take down the net-neutrality idea.\n\nThe trade debate\n\nMR. BUSSEY: Trade. There\u2019s growth issues for companies out here in terms of trade but also just data crossing borders, agreements with Europe on that, agreement with Latin America, what was in the TPP.\n\nMR. SEIB: I think the big question is China for the tech community and whether there will be access lost to markets. I think on trade what has happened so far is pretty simple. TPP is gone. Nafta is not going to go away. It\u2019s going to be tightened up, changed, tweaked, pick your verb.\n\nI think there is going to be a big move\u2014actually, frankly, I think this was going to happen anyway without President Trump winning\u2014there\u2019s going to be a pivot toward bilateral away from multilateral free-trade agreements.\n\nThere\u2019s kind of a feeling, not just in the Trump administration but in general, that they are more effective, they\u2019re cleaner, they\u2019re more easily enforced.\n\nThe problem is they take time. Obviously, it took a long time to negotiate TPP. If you do it one on one with every country in the Pacific, you\u2019re talking about a very long-term process. But I think that there is going to be a pullback in free-trade agreements.\n\nAnd I think in the middle of that, the great question is going to be: How does the president deal with China? And even in the absence of other Pacific trade agreements, does he take some steps to implement punitive measures against China?\n\nCurrency-manipulator status. Or, more likely I think, a series of suits and cases brought against China in existing trade organizations to try to punish China for its trade behavior. And what sort of retaliatory effect does that have? You have to worry about the potential for an escalating series of trade actions and counteractions with China.\n\nTPP and social issues\n\nMR. BUSSEY: Is the TPP really gone? Or does he look at this and say, \u201cLook, this is a great foundation for a bilateral with Japan?\u201d Maybe the TPP is no longer a multilateral, but it reprises itself as a series of bilaterals.\n\nMR. SEIB: I think that\u2019s most likely what happens. And it starts with Japan. I think the trade agenda will eventually shake out to be, \u201cLet\u2019s do bilateral trade agreements with the U.K. and bilateral trade agreements with Japan to make sure that in the wake of Brexit, in the wake of TPP\u2019s demise, we don\u2019t lose those two trade relationships.\u201d Those two trade relationships, which are too important to put at risk, don\u2019t get all screwed up in the process.\n\nMR. BUSSEY: How about other issues? Social issues that are important to companies in this room because they are important to the employees of those companies.\n\nMR. SEIB: I talked to a tech executive a few days ago who said, the problem at the outset of the Trump administration is that it\u2019s hard to get to the dialogue between the tech community and the Trump administration on the kinds of issues you asked about initially. The conversation falls apart on these issues.\n\nLGBT, climate change, immigration not as a business question but as a social question. The gap is so big. The gap is so large that I think it has the potential to get in the way of a more meaningful dialogue on issues of direct business importance to the tech community.\n\nFor example, I think a lot of companies in the Valley think that as a matter of conscience but also as a matter of supporting their workforce, they have to speak up on LGBT questions. As a matter of conscience and to show solidarity with the people who work for them, they have to speak up on climate change. That\u2019s going to put those companies and the tech community at odds with the administration.\n\nWrite to reports@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Tech Concerns and the Trump Administration"}

The ones that chief information officers should be paying attention to?\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s Rolfe Winkler spoke with Steve Herrod, managing director of General Catalyst, Peter Levine, general partner of Andreessen Horowitz, and Rich Wong, partner at Accel Partners. The conversation touched on machine learning and the future of big data and cloud computing. Edited excerpts follow.\n\nMR. WINKLER: VCs are supposed to predict the future. So, what\u2019s coming next?\n\nMR. WONG: A lot of the traditional categories just redone in a modern way. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll talk a little bit about [machine learning and artificial intelligence]. Those are two areas that I think are interesting.\n\nMR. LEVINE: I have this theory that cloud computing goes away in the not-too-distant future.\n\nIf we look at the ebb and flow of computing over the history of computing, we\u2019ve seen things go from [centralized mainframes to the centralized web]. The cloud-computing phenomenon right now is really centralized, it\u2019s basically a mainframe.\n\nI believe there is now a shift, a return to the edge where computing gets done much more at the edge than in the cloud. The Internet of Everything, specifically if you think about self-driving cars, is a great example of this. A self-driving car is a data center on wheels. And it has 200-plus central processing units. It\u2019s got to do all its computation at the endpoint and only pass back to the cloud, if it\u2019s connected at all, important bits of curated information.\n\nIf the car had to wait for the cloud to respond to the information being processed, it would blow through stop signs and crash because of the latency and because of the processing. As we see these new devices come as part of the edge, I believe that edge computing will start to dominate the landscape. And it will unlock a whole level of machine learning and artificial intelligence. I believe we will see a proliferation of edge computing come back into vogue.\n\nMR. HERROD: The future, as the past has always been, is heterogeneity. New apps, old apps. I\u2019m sure a lot of you go through a bucketing exercise where you take all of these apps that you have, and you put them into different buckets. New ones that you\u2019re going to invest in, old ones that you want to put in a corner and not break. You take applications from one place to the future or leave them where they are and try to make them more digestible.\n\nThe mission of CIOs\n\nMR. WINKLER: As you think about your hot new technologies, how do CIOs react?\n\nMR. LEVINE: Every company these days is becoming a software company. Old companies that had nothing to do with software in the past all have software development activities to unlock the invention that\u2019s occurring inside of these organizations. And so the developer is a very important part of that overall ecosystem. I would argue that the developer is the tail wagging the dog these days.\n\nWhen I was a developer, I couldn\u2019t buy a pencil. I had no budget, nothing. Now developers are very opinionated about what they want, the needs of the organization. We\u2019ve seen situations where if the organization doesn\u2019t provide the developer what the developer needs, the developer leaves and goes to work at another company where they sort of get the tools and services that they think are more adequate for them to do their job.\n\nMR. HERROD: The challenge I would give to all the startups that we invest in is, how can you make it incredibly digestible? Really simple to show some kind of value without sending someone on site. Give some kind of assessment that says, \u201cIf you used us, here\u2019s how we\u2019d save on people cost, on capital cost.\u201d\n\nMR. WINKLER: Hype versus reality, as you guys see it, when it comes to machine-learning AI. What\u2019s hype and what\u2019s reality?\n\nMR. WONG: What\u2019s hype is the all-seeing, all-knowing chatbot that can handle unbounded conversation. I think reality is, I can find a photo of my daughter in Google photos when she was two years old to now that she\u2019s 10, geotagged in every location. There are a ton of commercial applications to make business processes more efficient. What are the percentage of help-desk calls that are change password or reset password? That probably can be automated in a way that doesn\u2019t require as much human interaction.\n\nRich Wong, Peter Levine and Steve Herrod (far left to right) talk with The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Rolfe Winkler. Photo: Nikki Ritcher/Dow Jones\n\nMR. LEVINE: If we were sitting here a couple of years ago talking about big data, in my mind big data, that was sort of 1.0 of big data. Now the Holy Grail is not to be reactive, what happened in the past, but be predictive about what\u2019s going to happen in the future.\n\nMR. WONG: We have a background-check company. Uber does all the North American background checks through them. They use machine learning rather than doing it in a manual way. They can deliver a product that\u2019s more accurate, faster and about a third of the cost.\n\nMR. LEVINE: We think about infrastructure going to the cloud. There probably [will be fewer employees as more services move to the cloud], but at least they provide a higher-level service. What I\u2019d like to see is instead of us spending time managing [cloud infrastructure, that would be] handled automatically in the not-too-distant future and elevate our staffs to go solve more-critical business issues on top of that underlying infrastructure.\n\nWrite to reports@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Three VCs on What\u2019s Next in Technology"}

Does it require new architecture? Does it require new platforms? The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jay Greene discussed the topic with Richard Sherlund, managing director and chairman, software investment banking, at Barclays. The discussion covered everything from going beyond big data that looks to the past to newer applications that will be able to learn and make predictions.\n\nEdited excerpts follow.\n\nMR. GREENE: You have this idea that we are at the precipice of a big change in the way systems architecture is set up and that many CIOs are unprepared.\n\nMR. SHERLUND: I think the Internet of Things has enabled industrial companies to start thinking about the need to move to big data.\n\nBecause in the past you really couldn\u2019t aggregate big data. It was too expensive. But we have available to us in the cloud now, we can start to collect big data.\n\nThe next challenge is what do you do with that. Because companies that just had big data have been disappointed that it\u2019s not creating value. But once you can find the correlations in the data through machine learning, you can then begin to have predictive capabilities.\n\nMR. GREENE: What is making CIOs unprepared for this change?\n\nMR. SHERLUND: I don\u2019t know that CIOs are building the next generation of applications. What they\u2019re doing is building apps where they have some domain expertise. We\u2019re seeing this everywhere.\n\nData in the air\n\nMR. GREENE: What\u2019s fueling this platform are Internet of Things devices, right?\n\nMR. SHERLUND: The new Airbus has 70,000 sensors. None of that data comes down to earth. That stays on the airplane. That has to be processed locally. There are security reasons that you don\u2019t want that data going back and forth.\n\nIf you\u2019re running GE \u2019s jet engines, a lot of the correlation\u2019s going to be done in the cloud on Amazon or Microsoft. But some of that data\u2019s going to be processed on the edge [of the data network].\n\nMR. GREENE: You talk about how this data is about systems of prediction essentially. So walk me through a little bit of that. Are we talking about these sensors predicting on an airplane when an engine\u2019s about to fail or when it needs maintenance?\n\nMR. SHERLUND: First of all, you have to have the data scientists to optimize for machine learning. Because for an aircraft engine you may be looking at [performance data such as] temperature, vibration, pressures, whatever.\n\nThere was an example of a carrier over in Europe. And they were trying to figure out, \u201cWell, why is the engine wearing out faster than machine-learning predictions?\u201d And it turns out they were short-haul flights. So you\u2019re at lower elevations\u2014wear and tear with more friction.\n\nYou have to have some domain expertise to be intelligent as a data scientist in looking at that industry. Every industry has its quirks.\n\nThere are probably 100 or more [machine-learning companies] out there. They\u2019re just so small, you know? You\u2019ve got half a dozen or a dozen data scientists that get together, and [the companies are] for sale now at $100 to $200 million. You buy it, and then they leave, you\u2019re kind of hosed.\n\nYou wish there were a couple big machine-learning companies out there. As an investment banker, I\u2019d be all over them now because there\u2019s such high demand for them.\n\nThe progress at hand\n\nMR. GREENE: Are there companies that you think are further along in this architecture, are doing it well?\n\nMR. SHERLUND: I think there are industries that are further along. I think the industrial sector is kind of hyperfocused on this right now.\n\nRICHARD SHERLUND | \u2018I don\u2019t know that CIOs are building the next generation of applications.\u2019 Photo: Nikki Ritcher/Dow Jones\n\nI think health care, there\u2019s just enormous predictive value in the health-care field. You get physicals. And you can do correlations and realize kind of predictive things. Hospitals are huge in terms of the kinds of systems that need to be tied together. So, I mean, virtually every industry will be significantly impacted by this.\n\nOne of the things that\u2019s exciting to me is at the highest level, which is the applications level. So if I know when a machine\u2019s going to fail, let\u2019s say it\u2019s a jet engine. You know, a 95% probability in 200 hours that it\u2019s going to fail. If I\u2019m a software company in the business of providing a sales-force automation system, I want that data to be surfaced to the salesperson [so that he or she can attempt to make a sales call to that jet-engine customer about the need to repair or replace the engine].\n\nBecause that now becomes a lead-generation system. Not a more static customer-relationship-management system. I\u2019m now telling a salesperson, \u201cCall that customer.\u201d\n\nAnd because I integrate with the data, I know about the product. I can say, \u201cThis is the part. This is how old it is. Should be repaired or replaced. Call the customer now and notify them.\u201d\n\nWrite to reports@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Why CIOs Aren\u2019t Prepared for Big Data"}

Artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud computing are the new tools of the trade, and companies everywhere are striving to adopt them\u2014with varying degrees of success.\n\nWall Street Journal reporter Steven Norton discussed the challenges with Dheeraj Pandey, co-founder of Nutanix, a cloud-based platform that helps companies transform their IT infrastructure, and Lise Buyer, a partner at the IPO consultancy Class V Group. Edited excerpts of their conversation follow.\n\nMR. NORTON: What are some common obstacles to getting companies to transform their IT architecture to artificial intelligence, machine learning and the cloud?\n\nMR. PANDEY: The big one is inertia. The big question is, how do you migrate from your current to the new? How do I go from what I really want to do versus keeping the lights on today as well?\n\nMR. NORTON: If you are a board member being asked to endorse a shift in the data center or a new strategy, what questions do you ask the CIO?\n\nMS. BUYER: I surveyed a bunch of folks in that position to say, \u201cHey, what matters?\u201d And, of course, the answer is flexibility. Am I stuck into a rigid architecture? Or do I have something that can grow with me? Two is security. Three, scalability. And fourth is the economics of it all. Not just the economics of purchasing the specific equipment and software. But how does that affect the people in the field? How does that affect the people whose data is being migrated? And what risks am I taking in all of that? I want the agility of the cloud. I also want some stuff over the public cloud. But I also want some stuff that I control. I\u2019ve got service-level agreements I\u2019ve got to be responsible for, and nobody out there is going to do it for me. So how do I make sure I am delivering to my customers while I am effectively transitioning?\n\nAutomation\u2019s role\n\nMR. NORTON: More and more, we\u2019re seeing automation applied to IT. Do you envision a future where machines are self-healing and are using analytics to basically run themselves? And if so, how does that impact the structure of the IT organization?\n\nMS. BUYER: This is not just, \u201cOh my goodness, we have to keep jobs for people.\u201d You need folks who understand your system, how your system operates, what to do when something is running amok. That\u2019s one of the issues a lot of folks are thinking about in terms of making the decision of going all to the big providers versus keeping some of the solutions on the premises.\n\nMR. PANDEY: At the end of the day, there\u2019s a 12- to 24-month target that CIOs should have. How much do you pay your systems integrators, how much do you pay your managed-services people? Because that\u2019s tactical. There\u2019s so much money being invested. You know, \u201cI\u2019m going pay a systems integrator in India to watch for my server, which doesn\u2019t go down, and if it goes down, they go and put people or bodies to throw at the problem.\u201d There\u2019s a rate for it, like $75 per server. I\u2019m like, \u201cWow, you pay 75 bucks an hour for somebody to watch it, when machines should be doing this stuff?\u201d\n\nDHEERAJ PANDEY | \u2018The CIOs, their attention spans are becoming smaller.\u2019 Photo: Nikki Ritcher/Dow Jones\n\nSo there\u2019s a 12- to 24-month renegotiation with these managed-services contracts to unravel. But in the longer term, I think it is absolutely true that if you can\u2019t really do continuous innovation, continuous consumption, like the way your Gmail, your Facebook, your Google apps, and all that stuff is being constantly upgraded\u2014that\u2019s the idea of cloud. These mundane things about how do you upgrade every one month are probably as important as anything else that you can think of. And systems integrators don\u2019t get it, because they don\u2019t own the different formwares and softwares and hardwares. So it\u2019s very hard for them to actually get it right. It has to come from the factory of the operating system, one-click upgrades and the fact that you\u2019re able to migrate from old hardware to the new. It\u2019s all happening in pure software.\n\nMR. NORTON: So what are the people who were watching the servers doing now?\n\nMR. PANDEY: I think they\u2019re scratching their heads. What would India do now if it\u2019s going to get more automated and more cloudy and so on? What happens to the skills? Because the skills are not there to really think of a world where machines are more intelligent, able to self-heal and able to self-upgrade.\n\nAdvice to CIOs\n\nMR. NORTON: What\u2019s your advice for CIOs about how to start to communicate a change in architecture and business process? What things should they be looking out for when making a big architecture change?\n\nLISE BUYER | \u2018How do I make sure I am delivering to my customers while I am effectively transitioning?\u2019 Photo: Nikki Ritcher/Dow Jones\n\nMS. BUYER: That\u2019s been a challenge for CIOs since time immemorial, for everything from hand-held devices issued by the company to, \u201cHey, bring your own.\u201d There\u2019s really got to be a \u201cHere\u2019s why you need to do this. Here\u2019s why this is in your best interest as well as in our best interest.\u201d\n\nMR. PANDEY: There\u2019s this natural convergence that\u2019s happening in the overall architecture, because we are spinning up things faster. We\u2019re going from waterfall, which is the mainframe approach, to more agile methodologies where people really want to spin them up and spin them down and so on. That is probably the biggest shift, and it\u2019s happening with our customers.\n\nThe CIOs, their attention spans are becoming smaller. We are throwing out our phones every two years, every one year, as opposed to what it used to be with land lines and so on. So, in that scheme of things, a lot of the re-architecture has to happen in the application as well, to where you are not thinking about five years of deployment, but months and weeks, and having that elasticity in your architecture.\n\nWrite to reports@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "The Keys to Transforming IT Architecture"}

How do companies redefine applications and the very idea of computing? The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jay Greene spoke to Adrian Cockcroft, vice president of cloud architecture strategy at Amazon Web Services and a former executive at Netflix. Edited excerpts follow.\n\nMR. GREENE: Help these folks understand how to distinguish what Amazon Web Services does from the others.\n\nMR. COCKCROFT: We go out and listen to customers and we figure out what they need. We\u2019ve ended up building all kinds of interesting products as a result of that. A few years ago, people said, \u201cWe\u2019re not just trying to move a few applications to the cloud. We\u2019re trying to close entire data centers.\u201d That\u2019s a slightly different problem. So we built a program for doing that. Now we have customers like Capital One going from eight down to three data centers.\n\nMR. GREENE: Are there commonalities in the way that companies jump into the cloud?\n\nMR. COCKCROFT: The workload thing is interesting, and I eventually figured out why. I mean, what\u2019s Netflix got to do with, say, BMW ? It\u2019s a very different-sounding application. It turns out that it\u2019s the systems of engagement that change. If you think about Netflix DVD business\u2014customers used to visit once a week and say, \u201cI want the DVDs in this order.\u201d We had a very small amount of customer interaction on the web.\n\nWe went to streaming, and you\u2019re continuously searching for something to watch and then while you\u2019re watching, it\u2019s continuously sending data, logging your user experience. So it went up by an order of like 1,000 times. So the amount of capacity we needed per customer went up by many orders of magnitude.\n\nHow does that relate to BMW? They used to sell you a car and then talk to the dealer occasionally. And maybe every six months, they\u2019d have a customer interaction when you took your car in for service. The latest 7-series BMW is driving around continuously connected to AWS and sending video data or all kinds of telemetry. So they now have to build out something that can reach every country in the world, collect data from every car they sell going forward.\n\nThe 7-series is the first one that they\u2019re doing this for. But this is going to roll out everywhere. And this goes across industries. You just have to look at insurance, for example, where they used to basically have four or five pieces of information. \u201cDid you smoke? What\u2019s your ZIP Code?\u201d\n\nNow they\u2019re monitoring your kid driving around to see whether they should give you a better insurance deal and stuff like that. So all of these industries have this flood of data coming from all of the different ways that you can reach across the internet to your customer base. And that\u2019s the thing that is similar to Netflix. Netflix built platforms, highly available, highly scalable and could be deployed anywhere in the world. That\u2019s the big leverage you can have.\n\nMR. GREENE: You mentioned BMW. And BMW is, in addition to being an AWS customer, they use Microsoft Azure [web services]. How many of the most aggressive customers that you deal with are all in one cloud, and how many are using multiple clouds?\n\nADRIAN COCKCROFT | \u2018All of these industries have this flood of data coming.\u2019 Photo: Nikki Ritcher/Dow Jones\n\nMR. COCKCROFT: Pretty much everyone\u2019s got everything. Any company of any size has everything. So the question is, what proportions do you have it? If you go for a 50/50 split and use lowest common denominator, you\u2019re really hobbling yourself. You\u2019ll go more slowly, because you\u2019re having to train your people twice. You\u2019re cutting your ability to get a volume discount in half, so you don\u2019t get as good pricing because you\u2019ve got two vendors there. What we\u2019re seeing is that predominantly you want to pick one vendor and maximize that footprint.\n\nThe big concerns\n\nMR. GREENE: What are the areas that they have the most concerns? What are the areas where they want AWS to innovate most and give them new services, new products?\n\nMR. COCKCROFT: Let\u2019s just look at that data-center migration problem. We have this program to engage with a customer and move thousands of applications. If you think about your data center, how much network capacity does it have? Maybe you\u2019ve got 10 gigabits on a data center. But when you\u2019re trying to move data to the cloud, now you need 100 gigabits for a month.\n\nBulking up your network for a short period of time\u2019s expensive. So we send you a bunch of discs in a box, we\u2019ll ship you 100 terabytes at a time in a box. You plug it in, encrypt it. You take the key out, and it\u2019s just a brick. It\u2019s a bring-your-own-key model.\n\nMR. GREENE: I was at Oracle \u2019s Open World event a few months back and Larry Ellison said that they were jumping into cloud infrastructure. He said that \u201cAmazon\u2019s lead is over.\u201d How worried are you?\n\nMR. COCKCROFT: I don\u2019t think many people take that very seriously. As we go and talk to CIOs in particular, they keep telling us, \u201cCan you help us get off our legacy database vendors?\u201d We moved 16,000 databases last year.

Edited excerpts follow.\n\nMS. PASSARIELLO: The recent breakdown in Amazon.com Inc. \u2019s cloud-computing service\u2014what does it mean from a security standpoint?\n\nMR. RUBIN: For me, it became real when I got an email from our IT department explaining that about 90% of our staff services were offline or having intermittent problems. That woke me up to a realization: We\u2019re a lot more reliant on the cloud than we realize. And even though we think that when we put our information in the cloud, we abdicate responsibility for it and it all magically works, that isn\u2019t actually true.\n\nMS. PASSARIELLO: What about you, John?\n\nMR. HERING: When you think about technologies, aggregation risk is a thing. And we think about cybersecurity in the context of risk.\n\nAnd what is becoming apparent as we look at it from a risk-management perspective, is that when we have dependencies to our system, a single point of failure can cause huge disruption across the entire ecosystem. That\u2019s something that we need to spend more time thinking about.\n\nMS. PASSARIELLO: Both of your companies are focused on security, Lookout for mobile and Illumio for the cloud. John, why focus on mobile?\n\nMR. HERING: Mobile is representative of one of the most foundational platform shifts in computing history. What started as a personal technology has now moved its way into the enterprise.\n\nHackers tend to trend toward where the data is or where value is. And you have multiple billions of these devices out there. That\u2019s where we\u2019ve seen threats evolve, and that\u2019s where we think the most powerful place to secure the ecosystem is, from an enterprise perspective.\n\nAndrew Rubin talks about the new cybersecurity concerns facing organizations that have moved onto the cloud.\n\nMS. PASSARIELLO: Andrew, tell us about what that risk is like on cloud.\n\nMR. RUBIN: The Holy Grail, the asset that we\u2019re trying to protect, this data, lives in two places. It lives in the enterprise data center for those that still run those brick buildings on their own, and now more often, at places like Amazon Web Services or Azure.\n\nAnd so from our perspective, we said the same thing, which is we want to focus on helping companies protect the asset that they live, breathe and operate on. In today\u2019s world, a lot of it is still in those legacy data centers. But more of it is now living in either a hybrid situation or migrating to the cloud.\n\nMS. PASSARIELLO: John, you mentioned to me that the greatest threat to companies in their cybersecurity is their employees. How do you speak to companies about that?\n\nMR. HERING: One thing to truly take away is that the breach isn\u2019t the point of failure. [The key is] stopping it, and/or detecting it.\n\nWe spend so much time thinking about perimeter defenses, but remember, on average it takes over 200 days to detect a compromise, based on data out there in the market. To be supereffective, an adversary has to move laterally through a network.\n\nSo you have to look at where is the most important information? And what are the points of access to that information?\n\nConnected devices\n\nMS. PASSARIELLO: Is the risk different with internet-connected devices?\n\nMR. HERING: There is this thing call the smartphone subsidy. You had so much investment go into the mobile-device ecosystem that a whole bunch of derivative technologies came out of it\u2014chips, screens, etc. All of that investment led to a whole host of innovation in Internet of Things and connected cars and virtual reality.\n\nAnd what that says is, a lot of the techniques that go into exploiting a mobile device are actually somewhat applicable in attacking those things, too.\n\nTwo years ago, some colleagues and I contributed to some work on the Tesla. We hacked it and found some vulnerabilities. Once we had access, we could unlock the doors, open the doors. Think about the implications. Could you steer it off the road? Deploy the air bags?\n\nBut the greatest lesson for anyone who\u2019s building IoT devices or responsible for securing them is that it wasn\u2019t about the vulnerabilities themselves but about how quickly Tesla responded. They patched the devices within four days.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the difference between being secure and insecure\u2014how quickly you respond. Because vulnerabilities will happen.\n\nMR. RUBIN: As we connect all of these things, we\u2019re creating a larger attack surface than anyone ever could have fathomed. It is impossible to secure it 100% of the time.\n\nSo the question is, how do we reduce the surface area? How do we identify the highest-value targets and make them the hardest to breach? And most important, how do we reduce this concept of dwell time so that somebody doesn\u2019t get to break in your home and then live there undetected for 200 days, but instead, when they go from the living room to the dining room, no matter what, you catch them.\n\nWrite to reports@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "How New Technologies Are Providing New Openings for Hackers"}

Among them: the chance not just to move services online but to make a digital . Steven Rosenbush, editor of the CIO Journal, spoke with Judson Althoff, executive vice president of world-wide commercial business for Microsoft. Edited excerpts follow.\n\nMR ROSENBUSH: About eight months ago you did a deal with Boeing, a customer of quite a few decades. This was very different. How so?\n\nMR. ALTHOFF: They\u2019ve been a great commercial customer. We\u2019ve supplied them with all kinds of technology. But the deal we struck about eight months ago was fundamentally different. It marked their first foray into digital. They\u2019ve taken their digital aviation assets, such as failure analysis for air frames and engines. They moved that onto our Azure cloud-services platform.\n\nMR. ROSENBUSH: If I could just back up: When I think digital, it could mean my phone. It could mean email. What do you mean in this case?\n\nMR. ALTHOFF: Digital is a wave of innovation that\u2019s fueled by cloud technologies like [the Internet of Things], artificial intelligence and augmented reality. That allows businesses to change faster, become more efficient and more effective than ever. In the Boeing scenario they decided, \u201cWe want to take advantage of technologies in the cloud to rethink our business model for digital aviation.\u201d\n\nBoeing sold digital-aviation assets for many years. Traditionally that\u2019s meant showing up to an airline and deploying software on servers, handling everything from network operations to client-side devices.\n\nThe move of those aviation assets to Azure has actually enabled them to deploy more effectively, more nimbly and at a lower cost than ever before. From a technology standpoint, there\u2019s a huge advantage on being on the Azure platform.\n\nMR. ROSENBUSH: Is that better business or a different kind of business?\n\nMR. ALTHOFF: Just from a technology standpoint, it\u2019s just a more efficient business. The business model is unique. Rather than Microsoft just being a supplier of tech, we\u2019re a part of the cogs for their solution. And we actually sell together in the marketplace. If Boeing is calling on Lufthansa or Singapore Airlines or China Eastern, our sales teams are working together. So Microsoft will handle the cloud and infrastructure standpoint, whether that be private, hybrid or public. And Boeing can focus on the aviation assets.\n\nMR. ROSENBUSH: What is a business case for the cloud, and not just in terms of efficiency or the cost savings or the financial return, but what\u2019s happening at the level of the business model?\n\nMR. ALTHOFF: There are cloud scenarios where companies are doing a lot of lift-and-shift motions [which involves re-creating apps they already use in the cloud without modifying them]. But we see much greater opportunity in actually embracing digital scenarios.\n\nTake Land O\u2019Lakes. When my team came to me and said, \u201cJudson, we\u2019ve got a great idea. We\u2019re going to digitally transform Land O\u2019Lakes.\u201d I was like, how are we going to digitally transform butter? They said, \u201cYes, Land O\u2019Lakes is the king of dairy. But they have a tremendous amount of assets for precision agriculture. They sell commercial feed to co-op farmers and have amassed decades\u2019 worth of satellite imagery of all of these farms.\u201d So we took all of that imagery, pushed it into the cloud, created a massive data lake, built an intelligence fabric on top of it using Azure.\n\nWe prescribed the right kind of hybrid seeds and amount of seeds and soil treatments for every square meter of land. And then downloaded these prescriptions to semiautonomous driving tractors so that we can variably plant seeds across a field.\n\nYou\u2019ve taken a field that once produced 100 to 130 bushels of corn per acre to now producing over 500 bushels of corn per acre on the same piece of land. Land O\u2019Lakes is on their way to having a $13 billion precision-agriculture business.\n\nThe process took a good year of partnering with Land O\u2019Lakes from the leaders that run their precision-agriculture business to their CIO, to crafting the business model, to looking at the assets they had.\n\nJUDSON ALTHOFF | \u2019Digital transformation is a wave of innovation that\u2019s fueled by cloud technologies.\u2019 Photo: Nikki Ritcher/Dow Jones\n\nAnd we said, \u201cWell, listen, we can certainly take your data-center assets and lift and shift them to the cloud and save you a bunch of money. But let\u2019s think about the assets that you have and how we can actually transform your product line to really create a digital business.\u201d And so the business-planning part of it ran in parallel to the technical work.\n\nMoving ahead\n\nMR. ROSENBUSH: Once you begin to operationalize this move, what sort of practical, everyday challenges arise?\n\nMR. ALTHOFF: A lot of it comes to learning and culture change. Educating our customer base on how to grasp those, take advantage of them, operationalize them in the cloud is huge work. And then, even from that, the sort of end-user scenarios. Thinking about how do you actually put technology into the hands of the person who has not typically been a knowledge worker and better empower them?\n\nWe do a lot of work with Ecolab. And particularly a division of Ecolab called Nalco Water. Nalco, as a chemical-treating company, has been in the business of selling valves and water-treatment equipment. The people that work for Nalco have been largely blue-collar tech workers who go in and replace water valves that aren\u2019t functioning.\n\nWe worked with them to completely enable every product they have [to be part of the Internet of Things]. So it feeds data into a common data lake. We built once again an intelligence fabric across that data. Both their on-premises data as well as their unstructured data in the cloud. That hybrid again, that hybrid capability is super critical. And then that feeds all of their field-service automation scenarios and their [customer-relation management] systems such that their workers then show up proactively. You put that technology into the hands of these people, and you actually empower them to create clean water as a service, rather than simply selling valves.\n\nWrite to reports@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Microsoft\u2019s Judson Althoff on the Promise of the Cloud"}

ROSENBUSH: Tell us about Google Cloud. What is it and why is it different?\n\nMS. GREENE: At the very highest level, Google Cloud is the opportunity for Google to take its technology and make it easy to use and bring it to every company in the world.\n\nGoogle has been a cloud company from day one, so it\u2019s our data centers. It\u2019s our network, all that fiber under the ocean. It\u2019s the infrastructure that powers Google\u2019s seven applications that have over one billion active users.\n\nAnd then, it is the data management, the data analysis. That includes many of those really cutting-edge tools that Google invented. It\u2019s also the machine learning, [which enables computers to make inferences based on data they previously analyzed]. It\u2019s the APIs, [which specify how software components should interact] in front of smart data, and then finally the built-for-the-cloud integrated productivity and collaboration.\n\nMR. ROSENBUSH: What are the elements of these emerging technologies? What characterizes them?\n\nMS. GREENE: With the cloud, people can put all of this data together. They can join it with other data that isn\u2019t theirs, like Google Maps data. And then you have APIs, or this ability to just take some functionality, put it in a container, and it will be secure. It will be available. It will be scalable.\n\nPeople can just focus on making use of their data in real time, using other people\u2019s data combined with their data in real time, and focus on what their business does.\n\nMR. ROSENBUSH: It seems that the development of the cloud has accelerated. Yet 94% to 95% of all corporate data still resides in private data centers. Why is that?\n\nMS. GREENE: This is happening unimaginably fast, this movement to the cloud. In the past six months, I\u2019ve gone from talking to people about putting their new work loads and maybe looking at analyzing their data and doing some machine learning to people saying, \u201cI just want to get out of my data center. I just want to lift and shift it whole hog.\u201d\n\nAnd so obviously people built out their own internal private clouds for a long time and as you say, it\u2019s such a massive paradigm shift that, of course, all the data is still internal. But there are very, very few companies in the world that aren\u2019t looking at, \u201cHow am I going to get this moved over?\u201d\n\nMR. ROSENBUSH: What are the points of resistance, both in technical terms and in business and competitive terms?\n\nMS. GREENE: The move to the cloud requires moving massive amounts of data, obviously. It also requires people for new development. They can take advantage of more agile, quick ways to build things that depend on someone else\u2019s technology that they don\u2019t have to maintain and keep up-to-date.\n\nAnd then you also have a lot of legacy applications, built with a different set of tools. So the challenges are finding ways to work in a hybrid way as you migrate and figuring out what to retool and what to just pick up and move.\n\nCompetitive advantage\n\nMR. ROSENBUSH: Let\u2019s say that I\u2019m in Google Cloud and so is my competitor. Where do I find competitive advantage?\n\nMS. GREENE: What will happen is you will just focus completely on what your business does. Say you are an energy company and you want to optimize how you process whatever energy you\u2019re producing. You will use machine learning in the cloud to do that. And the better you do that, the less expensively you\u2019ll run.\n\nMR. ROSENBUSH: A few years ago, I interviewed Randy Mott, the chief information officer of General Motors. He was in the process of constructing a very sophisticated private cloud that was modeled on Google and Microsoft and Amazon and other companies. His point was, \u201cI don\u2019t want technology or software for companies that are like GM because there is only one GM. I need to have that in house.\u201d What would you say to Randy?\n\nDIANE GREENE | \u2018This is happening unimaginably fast, this movement to the cloud.\u2019 Photo: Nikki Ritcher/Dow Jones\n\nMS. GREENE: I would say, \u201cRandy, are you going to actually go build specialized chips for machine learning for GM? Do you do enough machine learning to pay for that? Are you going to have 700 people securing your network?\u201d\n\nMR. ROSENBUSH: He said that he was hiring 10,000 people, most of them software developers. Is that enough scale?\n\nMS. GREENE: So those are people that aren\u2019t building cars. He\u2019s sophisticated and I\u2019m sure he can build a very good cloud, but he has to compete with people that aren\u2019t putting their resources into that.\n\nWrite to reports@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Google\u2019s Diane Green on the Rush to the Cloud"}

Franklin/Associated Press\n\nFor a $37 billion market, search advertising has been rather sleepy for years.\n\nThat\u2019s because Google has long dominated both internet searches and related ad spending. In fact, most search advertisers spend the vast majority of their budgets with Google, perhaps sprinkle in a bit of Microsoft \u2019s Bing, and call it day.\n\nBut that could be changing, thanks to Amazon and perhaps Pinterest. That\u2019s welcome news for search advertisers, who hope for more options for clients, as well as better products and pricing that could be spurred by more competition.\n\nTo date, \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been a tremendous amount of innovation in search,\u201d said Scott Shamberg, U.S. president of Performics, a direct response-focused division of Publicis Media.\n\nFor years, there hasn\u2019t been much fluidity in terms of user behavior. Google commanded roughly 64% of desktop searches in December, according to comScore, followed by 23% for Microsoft\u2019s Bing\u2014rankings that have hardly budged in years. Google recorded over 12 billion desktop searches in January, versus less than one billion on Amazon.\n\nThe domination in behavior also translates to advertising. Google is expected to pull in 76% of the search ad spending in the U.S. this year, versus about 8.3% for Microsoft and less than 1% for Amazon, says eMarketer.\n\nAnd on mobile, the digital ad buying firm Merkle estimated that Google was responsible for a staggering 96% of all search-ad clicks on mobile devices during the fourth quarter.\n\nThus, the entry of Amazon and others into the sector, \u201cvery much has the potential to change things,\u201d Mr. Shamberg said.\n\nBut change won\u2019t happen overnight.\n\nIn January, Forrester Research analyst Collin Colburn published a report on the search ad market. He said expects a \u201cpotentially pretty big shift over the next five years\u201d in terms of consumer and advertiser behavior.\n\nSeven or eight years ago, \u201cany question, any need you had, turned to a search engine,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, particularly on mobile, people might turn to Amazon to look for apparel, Pinterest to look for home furnishing ideas, or a site like Trivago for travel plans. Each of these searches is \u201ctaking one more search away, and starting to erode Google\u2019s dominance,\u201d Mr. Colburn said. We\u2019ve seen Google\u2019s volume decline over last few years.\u201d\n\nGoogle didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nCertainly, Google\u2019s recent $22.4 billion ad revenue quarter, driven largely by search advertising, would seem to affirm that the company\u2019s dominance is hardly collapsing. But as Amazon enters any market, competitors take notice. The company\u2019s footprint in digital advertising overall has been expanding, and many in the industry see it as a sleeping giant.\n\nAmazon runs ads that appear following specific searches. Photo: Amazon\n\nAmazon isn't about to roll out a full-fledged consumer search destination. But is has spent the past few years quietly rolling out three different search ad products designed to help people find more things to buy on Amazon.com.\n\nAmazon\u2019s \u201cProduct Display Ads\u201d feature product images and text that relate to people\u2019s searches. For example, a person searching for \u201csleeping bags\u201d might see ads for camping products like tents.\n\nThese search ads direct people to product pages on Amazon; unlike classic search ads, they don\u2019t send people to other sites on the web.\n\n\u201cIn the past 12 to 18 months we\u2019ve really been focusing on search,\u201d said Seth Dallaire, Amazon\u2019s vice president of global advertising sales at Amazon. \u201cIt\u2019s still really early days for us.\u201d\n\nMr. Dallaire noted that search is a mature ad market, and many advertisers and specialty search agencies have built \u201csuper sophisticated\u201d buying operations using thousands of keywords and product databases to power ads.\n\nThus, getting these advertisers to shift spending often means having to get plugged into their ad-buying software\u2014and, in turn, receiving a vital real estate presence on whatever digital dashboard they use to make decisions on where to spend.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still building a lot of the capabilities and tools some of these big buyers expect of us,\u201d Mr. Dallaire.\n\nScott Linzer, vice president of owned media (i.e. paid advertising rather than organic marketing) at the Hearst-owned digital agency iCrossing, said that \u201cfor certain clients, [Amazon\u2019s search ads have] made material impacts on their spending.\u201d One reason they like Amazon\u2019s emergence is that Google\u2019s search ads can get pricey, depending upon competition at a given moment.\n\nThat\u2019s part of Pinterest\u2019s sell, as well. The company just rolled out search ads last month. These ads appear when people conduct searches such as \u201dliving room ideas\u201d and are more image centric than classic text links on a search engine.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have as dense of demand as Google right now,\u201d said Jon Kaplan, Pinterets\u2019s global head of partnerships. \u201cYou might see a pretty steep discount.\u201d\n\nPrices for search ads will vary by product category and time of year, but theoretically the fewer advertisers bidding for these ads on Pinterest early on, the fewer instances that ad prices will be driven higher.\n\nMr. Kaplan said that Pinterest is already gaining traction in the market. He recently announced that Pinterest would plug its search ad technology into the buying platform for Kenshoo, a firm that helps retailers like Macy\u2019s and Home Depot spend millions on search ads. \u201cWe were at their partner conference, and got a rousing round of applause,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019d had a new partner on their dashboard in a decade.\u201d\n\nBoth Pinterest and Amazon believe they can help search advertisers reach people before they have made up their minds on products. It remains to be seen if targeting those undecided shoppers with ads will perform as well as Google\u2019s have for so long\u2014considering that so many people who conduct Google searches know exactly what they want.\n\nAs for Amazon\u2019s emergence over the past two years, \u201cthe true mystery is, really can there be a third player here?\u201d asked Todd Bowman, director of search engine marketing at Merkle. \u201cWe are prepping our clients for that reality.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Amazon and Pinterest Threaten to Shake Up the Search Ad Market"}

Now Pinterest says it plans to open up this new product to a wider swath of marketers.\n\nPinterest reaches 150 million unique monthly users, with more than half of those users falling outside the U.S. A big reason people visit the site is to search for products or ideas, everything from big life moments to what they might cook for dinner that night, explained Jon Kaplan, Pinterest\u2019s global head of partnerships.\n\nIn fact, people conduct 2 billion searches on Pinterest a month, accounting for about half of the site\u2019s activity, Mr. Kaplan said.\n\nUntil now, advertisers could run ads using keywords, like \u201cfurniture,\u201d but these ads would run throughout the site alongside relevant content. Now, the ads will appear right after people type in searches.\n\nLike search ads on Google, the new Pinterest ads will be sold via a digital auction on a cost-per-click basis. However, instead of Google\u2019s mostly text-based ads, Pinterest\u2019s search ads will primarily feature images.\n\nThe effort could be a needed catalyst for Pinterest, which ad executives say has struggled to define itself. Advertisers have been urging Pinterest to move faster when it comes to rolling out new ad products, and many have long hoped for more competition in a marketplace that is dominated by Google.\n\nStarting out, Pinterest said it plans to sell the ads directly, though down the road thousands of advertisers will be able to purchase these ads using a self-serve digital interface, much like Google.\n\nTo help accelerate the rollout, Pinterest is partnering with Kenshoo, which operates ad buying software used by many search advertisers, to enable retailers to deliver feeds that can be used to create streams of product-specific search ads in real time.\n\nMr. Kaplan noted that 97% of Pinterest\u2019s search queries don\u2019t mention a specific brand. For test partners, the new search ads have yielded \u201cnew demand\u201d from people who may not know exactly what products they want, he said.\n\nThus, the hope is that the new offering should open up Pinterest to a whole new set of advertisers and specialty search agencies\u2014the likes of which spend lots of money on Google search ads, as well as ads on Microsoft \u2019s Bing.\n\n\u201cWe think we have something that is differentiated,\u201d Mr. Kaplan said. \u201cWe see this as a very big new opportunity.\u201d\n\nWill Margiloff, chief executive at the marketing technology firm IgnitionOne, works with many search advertisers, but has yet do much business with Pinterest. He agreed that Pinterest has an \u201copportunity to own retail visual search\u201d-- if they eventually open up search ad buying to enough automated digital ad buying platforms.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about tens of billions in [marketer spending] if you make the right integrations,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Pinterest Rolls Out Search Ads"}
{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-looms-quietly-in-digital-ad-landscape-1475782113", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Photo: Reuters\n\nLast week, nearly every major digital advertising player seemed to be on stage at some point during Advertising Week in New York. That is, except for the tech giant you\u2019ve definitely heard of but may not even realize is in the ad business: Amazon.\n\nAmazon may not be touting its efforts in public, but behind the scenes it has been trying to expand its footprint in the ad business, digital media executives say.\n\nTo date, Amazon\u2019s ad business has mostly focused on driving online sales with targeted ads on sites across the web, leveraging its rich supply of shopping data culled from years of operating a massive e-commerce business. It can, for example, help an advertiser target people who have recently searched for men\u2019s apparel products.\n\nLately the company has been catering to a wider range of brands -- the kind that advertise on TV and focus on \u201ctop of the purchase funnel\u201d metrics, such as getting people to feel favorably about their brand. Amazon believes its data is just as useful for those marketers.\n\nElsewhere, Amazon has dabbled in other areas of the ad business: it sells search ads on Amazon.com and it has a \u201cheader bidding\u201d product meant to help publishers make more money off programmatic ads.\n\nStill, little is known about Amazon\u2019s longer term ambitions. It\u2019s easy to imagine the company attacking huge, potentially lucrative swaths of the advertising industry.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been putting all of the pieces together,\u201d said Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of the digital ad agency Deep Focus. Mr. Schafer said that to date, Amazon has mostly focused on targeting e-commerce shoppers with digital ads. \u201cBut they just have so much [consumer] intent data, and now video data, that you\u2019ve got to think they\u2019re up to something.\u201d\n\nFor example, the company could make a bigger play for mobile search dollars--an arena that is less dominated by Google than search on the desktop Web. Amazon is also one of the few companies in position to track people across multiple devices, a big advantage in the mobile ad game. The company could mount a bigger challenge to Facebook \u2019s Audience Network, which essentially aspires to run ads on every site on the web. Or Amazon could charge into the nascent world of advertising on connected TVs.\n\nDespite all this potential, plenty of ad industry executives wonder whether Amazon is totally committed to building its ad business. After all, the company derives the vast majority of its revenue selling everything under the sun online, and is busy with a variety of other projects from original TV programming to package-delivering drones.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been operating for a few years functionally in stealth mode. You have to ask the right people, or pull the right chains to get an understanding of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Evan Hanlon, director of strategy & platforms at the ad buying giant GroupM.\n\nAmazon doesn\u2019t break out ad revenue in its earnings reports. The company generated over $107 billion in sales in 2015.\n\nAccording to eMarketer, Amazon should pull in just over $1 billion in online ad revenue in 2017 in the U.S., an increase of 9.4% compared to this year. Contrast that with Snapchat, which is expected to generate $800 million next year in the U.S., a year-over-year surge of over 130%, says eMarketer. Google\u2019s U.S. ad revenue in 2017 is expected to approach $34 billion, while Facebook\u2019s U.S. revenue should be north of $15 billion.\n\nYou\u2019ll find plenty of digital ad insiders betting that Amazon, despite being far behind Google and Facebook in advertising, could legitimately challenge the behemoths.\n\nAmazon's ad buying technology is called Amazon Advertising Platform Photo: Amazon\n\nCurrently, Amazon operates its own \u201cdemand-side platform,\u201d through which it buys targeted ads for its many retail partners using its robust set of consumer data. The company lets big marketers use this technology, Amazon Advertising Platform, and its data, to buy ads on sites across the web through ad exchanges managed by firms like AppNexus and Google.\n\nAmazon sets tight limits on how its data is used; advertisers can\u2019t use it outside of its platform.\n\n\u201cThey play it really close to the chest,\u201d said Britney Greenhouse, director of video and digital Investment at the ad buying firm Horizon Media.\n\nFour years ago Amazon was one of the first companies to introduce \u201cheader bidding,\u201d which enables publishers to have multiple ad tech companies bid on ad space simultaneously.\n\nMediaRadar, a company that provides ad sales intelligence to over 1,400 media clients, says Amazon\u2019s header bidding software is plugged into around 100 websites, including sites managed by Time Inc., Hearst and The Weather Company. Indeed, publishers like USA Today say they\u2019ve only just started pulling in demand from Amazon in recent months as header bidding becomes more popular.\n\nMr. Hanlon of GroupM sees real potential in Amazon\u2019s efforts to service companies trying to build brand awareness rather than spur an immediate purchase. For example, a travel advertiser might target people who have in the past purchased luxury luggage and accessories with vacation ideas, said Mr. Hanlon.\n\n\u201cThey are not ubiquitous and not mandatory for many clients yet, but I could easily see that changing,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Amazon Looms Quietly in Digital Ad Landscape"}

While that growth exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations, the company\u2019s 8.3% increase in profit fell short of expectations and the stock fell 2.3% in late trading Thursday.\n\nThere was plenty to unpack in the results for marketers. Here are the five most important advertising-related takeaways from the search giant\u2019s earnings conference call:\n\n1) Mobile search, programmatic and YouTube are driving Google\u2019s growth\n\nThere was a time when the overarching consumer shift to mobile seemed to worry Google, but that time has definitely passed.\n\n\u201cAdvertising revenue growth was driven by mobile search, with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic,\u201d Alphabet\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on the call.\n\nThe company received 96% of all search-ad clicks on mobile devices in the quarter, according to estimates from digital-marketing firm Merkle Inc. Meanwhile, the company cited programmatic advertising\u2019s strength multiple times. Ms. Porat even gave a shout out to \u201cDBM\u201d-- the company\u2019s ad tech platform DoubleClick Bid Manager -- for helping fuel ad growth.\n\nOn the YouTube front, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai cited a campaign for the NBA\u2019s opening night that employed \u201creal time\u201d behind-the-scenes clips in ads that reached 19 million people on the web as an example of the platform\u2019s burgeoning potential.\n\n2) The holidays were a breakout period for mobile shopping and location-based ads\n\n\u201cThis was the year that mobile shopping truly went mainstream,\u201d said Mr. Pichai, who talked up how retailers used branded images on Google\u2019s mapping product to reach consumers right when they were looking for places to shop.\n\n3) Google wants you to know it\u2019s committed to ad measurement\n\nMr. Pichai spent some time on the call touting the ways that Google is helping to prove to brands that its ad products drive business. He mentioned a two-year-old \u201cstore visits\u201d tracking tool that has helped advertisers record 3 million visits to stores that Google believes were driven by its digital ads.\n\n4) Alphabet is aiming high with YouTube content\n\nMr. Pichai said that every day over a thousand YouTube creators cross the thousand-subscriber threshold. He also called out YouTube\u2019s growing number of original series: 27, including one starring a YouTube-born creator that was just featured at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do more in 2017,\u201d he said. And while he noted that these originals were driving sign-ups for the YouTube Red subscription service, he declined to provide any update on how many people were signed up, despite numerous questions by investors.\n\n5) \u201cAMP\u201d is working\n\nThe company\u2019s \u201cAccelerated Mobile Pages\u201d initiative, designed to help publishers produce faster, lighter, more mobile-friendly webpages, is resulting in higher click-through rates and ad prices, said Mr. Pichai.\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Marketers Should Note These 5 Things From Google Parent Alphabet\u2019s Earnings"}

It has touted itself as a scrapbooking site, a visual search engine and, more recently, a vehicle to reach female millennials.\n\nPinterest has also frustrated some ad buyers with what they say has been a slow rollout of ad products and various data and ad tech offerings.\n\nNoah King, vice president and director of social media at Socialyse, a division of Havas, said that in his mind, digital giants like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat have clearly defined the roles they play for big brands, while Pinterest has resisted settling on a core mission.\n\n\u201cPinterest has an ownable space,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s for planning events, collecting things. It\u2019s super niche. It skews very female.

Since Pinterest blends elements of search, product recommendations and commerce, it isn\u2019t easy to figure out how to explain the company \u201cin a way that isn\u2019t confusing in an industry where everybody else is one thing or the other.\u201d\n\nIn October, the company\u2019s chief executive, Ben Silbermann, confirmed reports that Pinterest\u2019s 2016 revenue would land around $300 million, and that its monthly unique user base had jumped to 150 million globally.\n\nPinterest has raised about $1.3 billion and was valued at $11 billion in its latest fundraising round. Ramping up its ad business is crucial in order to live up to that valuation.\n\n\u201cThey have investors pressuring them to be a first-tier player and they are nowhere near that,\u201d said Mr. King.\n\nPinterest has attracted advertisers such as Kraft.

But so far, the performance has not been \u201crobust or consistent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat ultimately matters to a media buyer is inventory and performance,\u201d Mr. Stein said.

Before the surprise ending, Sunday night\u2019s Academy Awards struck a variety of political notes, from host Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s call for unity to remarks touching on topics like border walls and transgender rights. The theme didn\u2019t stop during the breaks. Cadillac and Hyatt were among the companies that used pricey ad slots to communicate messages of diversity and inclusion. The New York Times ran an ad trumpeting its credibility amid a sea of fake news. President Donald Trump tweeted his distaste for the ad, which was released online prior to the telecast. Some viewers praised the ads for being better than the politically charged ads that appeared in this month\u2019s Super Bowl. \u201cThe Oscars commercials are so much smarter, more creative and at times in touch w the human spirit than the overrated junk Super Bowl ads,\u201d tweeted ESPN analyst Michael Wilbon. Speaking of ESPN, the network was among the crop of first-time winners, along with Amazon and Netflix. Here\u2019s the full list of winners, from Variety.\n\nTRUMP VS. PRESS: Watching President Trump tell jokes to a room full of political journalists (his favorite people) at Washington\u2019s annual \u201cnerd prom\u201d would have been quite the surreal spectacle. Well, it won\u2019t happen. Mr. Trump tweeted over the weekend that he won\u2019t be attending the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, reports WSJ. Meanwhile, Bloomberg decided not to host the high-profile after-party it normally throws following the dinner, according to Axios. Relations between the White House and press continued to deteriorate Friday, when reporters from several major news outlets, including the New York Times and CNN, were excluded from a press briefing. The White House Correspondents\u2019 Association lodged a strong protest. In remarks hours earlier at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Mr. Trump echoed his earlier statements about \u201cfake\u201d news and reiterated that the press is \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d In other news media drama, Breitbart CEO Larry Solov on Friday asked the standing committee of the U.S. Senate Press Gallery to grant the conservative site permanent credentials to cover Congress, reports Buzzfeed. At the meeting, the committee pressed for details on Breitbart\u2019s ownership and its relationship with top Trump aide Steve Bannon.\n\nOTT TARGETING: As more people watch TV through online streaming channels, they\u2019ll also probably be watching more targeted ads. At least, that\u2019s the idea behind a partnership between ad tech company BrightLine and Nielsen Marketing Cloud, the media research firm\u2019s marketing software division, reports CMO Today. As part of the deal, BrightLine will be able to tap into Nielsen\u2019s 60,000 audience segments, and use that data to help advertisers serve more targeted ads on connected TVs and other devices. BrightLine is already helping media companies create more interactive ads. An automotive ad, for example, might prompt the viewer to access more video content or receive information on local dealer locations through a few clicks of their remote. With Nielsen\u2019s data, advertisers will know more about the household, and that it\u2019s made up of people who have kids and may be in the market for a car, for example. \u201cThis creates something that is nice and sweet and simple. It will make it much easier for advertisers and agencies to explore,\u201d said Michael Bologna, president of Modi Media, a division of the media buying giant GroupM.\n\nTV WATCHING: If you were creeped out by advertisers\u2019 advanced online ad-tracking abilities, just wait until they\u2019re monitoring you through your TV screen. Companies like TVision Insights have technology that can do just that, reports the New York Times. The idea is to determine when you\u2019re watching and how you\u2019re reacting, and use that kind of data to serve more targeted ads. \u201cThe big thing for TV advertisers and the networks is: Are you actually looking at the screen or not?\u201d said Dan Schiffman, the chief revenue officer of TVision. \u201cWhat you looked at is interesting, but the fact that you looked away is arguably the most interesting.\u201d Marketers are looking for new data about TV viewing that goes beyond the demographic information supplied by Nielsen. TVision has recruited around 7,500 people from 2,000 households in the Boston, Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth areas to have their TV-watching, well, watched, according to the Times.

The deal will potentially enable advertisers to tap into Nielsen\u2019s 60,000 different audience segments, which can be used for ad targeting purposes on connected TVs, as well as other devices.\n\nThe vision driving the partnership is to help make TV ads shown on over-the-top streaming apps on devices like Apple TVs or Rokus more interactive and more targeted.\n\nMedia companies such as Hulu, Discovery Communications and Viacom already can use BrightLine\u2019s technology to add elements of interactivity and personalization to their traditional TV ads. For example, a person watching a show via a cable network\u2019s over-the-top app might see a car ad, and that ad could prompt the viewer to access more video content or receive information on local dealer locations through a few clicks of their remote.\n\nThese BrightLine-powered ads have been available for several years. Hulu has run recent campaigns for advertisers such as Toyota, Hennessy and Texas Tourism.\n\nOver the past few years, BrightLine\u2019s platform has been collecting data at the device level. It uses that data to figure out which TV ads perform best on specific apps and the various devices people use to stream TV shows.\n\nNow via the Nielsen deal, it will be able to know which of those devices are found in households that are made up of certain characteristics, such as people who have kids and may be in the market for a car. Advertisers will be able to target specific creative or offers to different audience segments using a variety of data sets.\n\nIn the above example, households with children could be shown an ad for minivans, while another household might see a sports car ad.\n\nEven as more people stream their favorite shows via connected televisions, it\u2019s still very early days in OTT advertising. But BrightLine believes its roster of partners, which also includes networks like ESPN and Fox, will help accelerate the market\u2019s growth.\n\nThe company\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, Jacqueline Corbelli, said in order to get more advertisers interested in buying targeted ads on smart TVs, it\u2019s crucial for the market to have a centralized sales outlet \u201cthat could deliver scale across the full OTT footprint,\u201d she said.\n\nTo help build out that footprint, BrightLine last year raised $20 million in series A funding.\n\nOf course, a capability is one thing. There needs to be interest from both ad buyers and sellers for a significant market for targeted OTT ads to develop. Right now, ads on connected TV apps are often sold on a national level as part of big packages.\n\nAs more marketers grow accustomed to using data in digital advertising, the more they want to apply that tactic to other media, said Damian Garbaccio, executive vice president, commercial, for Nielsen Marketing Cloud. \u201cIs it going to be a billion dollar market tomorrow? No. But there is certainly demand from clients. It is real,\u201d he said.\n\nMarketers like Hennessey can use BrightLine's technology to offer people access to more video content within traditional ads Photo: BrightLine\n\n\u201cAdvertisers are never ready for anything new. They need a push,\u201d added Michael Bologna, president of Modi Media, a division of the media buying giant GroupM. \u201cThis creates something that is nice and sweet and simple. It will make it much easier for advertisers and agencies to explore.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that even as more advertisers express interest in better TV ad targeting, it\u2019s still largely an open question as to whether more passive living room viewers want to interact with ads on TV screens. Companies like TiVo have been touting such interactivity for years, but most advertisers still rely on traditional 30-second ads.\n\nPeter Naylor, senior vice president of advertising sales at Hulu, said that it will be key for advertisers testing these ads to make them simple for consumers to interact with while delivering something valuable. He noted that it took a while for both consumers and advertisers to grow accustomed to mobile touch screens, and he thinks TV ads will go through a similar evolution.\n\n\u201cThe idea that I can play with an ad on my TV, [while new now], there will be a time when people expect that,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Advertising on Streaming TV Devices Is About to Get More Targeted"}

Photo: Alex Kroke\n\nPaul Rittenberg, the longtime head of advertising sales for Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network, is stepping down at the end of April.\n\nOne of the first hires at Fox News before it launched in 1996, Mr. Rittenberg is credited as a key contributor to the financial growth of the cable news network.\n\nFox News was estimated by industry consulting firm SNL Kagan to take in a record $1.2 billion in gross advertising revenue in 2016, easily beating CNN and MSNBC. Fox News credited Mr. Rittenberg for helping the network achieve \u201coperational break-even by doubling advertising sales every year\u201d and said both channels had their most profitable years in 2016.\n\n\u201cThroughout his 20 plus years at FOX News, Paul has developed powerful relationships with clients and built one of the most respected and successful teams in the industry,\u201d said Fox News Co-Presidents Jack Abernethy and Bill Shine in a joint statement.\n\nNo replacement for Mr. Rittenberg, whose official title is executive vice president of advertising sales, has been named.\n\nMr. Rittenberg\u2019s early years running ad sales were a challenge. Fox News didn\u2019t start regularly beating Time Warner Inc. \u2019s CNN in viewership until 2002, but for many years after CNN still drew higher rates for commercials. Not only did CNN have a 16-year head start in establishing itself as the cable news leader, the more conservative evening opinion shows on Fox News created an early impression that the channel was more akin to talk radio than straight news, a sentiment that the network still sometimes has to push back against to this day.\n\n\u201cPerception lags reality,\u201d Mr. Rittenberg said in a 2004 Wall Street Journal article on Fox News\u2019 efforts to close the gap with CNN on ad rates. One of the issues Mr. Rittenberg had to wrestle with for years was that Fox News sold ads at very low prices when it was launching, and getting major advertisers to pay significant increases took time, despite the ratings growth at the network. Many advertisers had signed long-term deals that became bargains for many years.\n\n\u201cIt has been one of my greatest honors to help build the FOX News brand from the ground up into the most successful and recognizable names in the industry,\u201d Mr. Rittenberg said in the statement. \u201cI am so proud of what we were able to accomplish and am grateful for the opportunity to work with such a talented team.\u201d\n\nRecruited to Fox News from CNBC by former Fox News Chairman and Chief Executive Roger Ailes, who had previously run CNBC, Mr. Rittenberg didn\u2019t fit the right-wing leanings of his boss. He even used to keep a copy of \u201cLies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right\u201d by Al Franken, the comedian turned Democratic Senator, in his office as a joke.\n\nHe is the second high-profile network sales head to exit parent company 21st Century Fox in the past 12 months. Last September, Toby Byrne stepped down as president of advertising sales for the Fox Networks Group, which includes Fox Broadcasting, cable networks FX and National Geographic and Fox Sports. Bruce Lefkowitz, executive vice president of ad sales, is overseeing the unit.\n\nFox News and Fox Business Network will continue to operate their ad sales separately from the rest of the company and report to Mr. Abernethy, a spokeswoman said.\n\n21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal parent company News Corp share common ownership.\n\nWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Fox News\u2019 Head of Ad Sales, Paul Rittenberg, to Step Down"}

Pretty huge numbers, right? Well, YouTube remains the 800-pound gorilla: its worldwide viewership has surpassed 1 billion hours a day, according to The Wall Street Journal. To give a little perspective: that\u2019s not far off the 1.25 billion hours people spend watching live and recorded TV in the U.S. Of course, TV still generates far more in ad revenue than YouTube and online video as a whole. And it isn\u2019t clear if YouTube is making money -- growth is the priority. But the new usage milestone might get the attention of some big advertisers that haven\u2019t treated YouTube as a must-buy thus far. Meanwhile, YouTube is making itself more accessible to TV viewers. As WSJ reports, Google reached a deal with Comcast that will enable the cable giant\u2019s customers to search for YouTube videos through their X1 cable boxes, alongside live and on-demand programming. Comcast said that nearly half of its subscribers currently use X1 boxes, which makes the integration possible. The deal, which follows a similar partnership between Netflix and Comcast, might help the cable operator attract more consumers to its broadband products. For YouTube, the deal could allow the web-video company to attract new subscribers to its YouTube Red service, which has struggled to gain traction.\n\nHIGH DRAMA, LOW RATINGS: The Oscars had off-the-charts buzz thanks to the Great Envelope Malfunction of 2017 but its ratings didn\u2019t sizzle. ABC\u2019s awards show telecast recorded about 33 million viewers, making it the least-watched edition since 2008, CMO Today reports. What was PwC\u2019s envelope-guarding executive, Brian Cullinan, doing backstage right before the flub that resulted in \u201cLa La Land\u201d mistakenly being announced as best picture? He was tweeting a photo of Best Actress winner Emma Stone, apparently, WSJ reports. Mr. Cullinan later deleted the tweet. PwC claimed responsibility and apologized for handing presenters the wrong envelope. But it could take a lot more than an apology for the company, whose role as ballot-counter for the Academy is meant to promote its reputation for accuracy, to bounce back from this kind of error, Ad Age reports. \u201cIt is a potentially a significant dent to their brand,\u201d one branding expert said. If anyone is enjoying the drama it\u2019s President Donald Trump, who told the conservative news site Breitbart that the Oscars were so focused on politics that \u201cthey didn\u2019t get the act together at the end.\u201d\n\nNOTHING TO SEE HERE: Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said Monday that he doesn\u2019t expect the agency to review AT&T Inc.\u2019s $85 billion takeover of Time Warner Inc., since the deal was designed to keep airwave licenses from being transferred, reports WSJ. Shares of Time Warner had been trading at a discount to AT&T\u2019s original offer of $107.50 per share, but the gap has narrowed in recent weeks and the chairman\u2019s remarks certainly won\u2019t hurt the trend. Mr. Pai said that any decision would depend on the specifics of a deal. His predecessor Tom Wheeler, who pushed against Sprint Corp.\u2019s attempted merger with rival T-Mobile US Inc., wanted to maintain four major national wireless providers. Mr. Pai doesn\u2019t share that view. \u201cThere is no specific number I can throw out there as definitive,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve long said that I can\u2019t opine on the optimal market structure.\u201d In the interview with Breitbart on Monday, President Trump, who was critical of the deal in the final stretch of the campaign, said he wouldn\u2019t comment on a specific transaction but noted: \u201cYou have to have competition in the marketplace and you have to have competition among the media.\u201d\n\nTRANSPARENCY ABROAD: A French law that bans media agencies and buyers from collecting rebates and serving as both the buyer and seller of media was recently revised to more explicitly encompass digital media buying, reports Business Insider. A new version of the law, dubbed Loi Sapin, will cover, \u201cany medium connected to the internet, such as computers, tablets, mobile phones, televisions, and digital panels.\u201d As part of the update, media owners will need to send invoices and information about their work with the agency directly to the advertiser. The update comes amid a raging debate over transparency in the U.S. ad business, and reminds ad buyers and sellers that client concerns surrounding conflicts of interest and agencies\u2019 bad behavior also exist overseas. A report from the Association of National Advertisers last year shed light on the ways in which agencies had been collecting rebates from media vendors without their clients\u2019 knowledge. A number of clients have since launched audits of their media agencies.\n\nElsewhere\n\nPaul Rittenberg, head of advertising sales for Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network, is leaving the company at the end of April.

The latest entrant: You Tube, which announced Tuesday it will launch a $35-a-month subscription service letting users stream a package of some 40 broadcast and cable channels over the web, The Wall Street Journal reports. Other companies targeting the cord-cutting cohort include Sling, Sony and AT&T, which are all in the market already, and Hulu, which will be there shortly. That\u2019s a lot of companies promising to reinvent television -- and take on traditional pay TV giants like Comcast and Charter. For media companies, getting their channels into these new bundles is important: they\u2019ve been telling investors that the new crop of TV distributors can make up for the decline of traditional cable. YouTube TV will carry ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC along with big cable channels owned by the parents of those broadcasters. Not on the list (at least not yet) are networks owned by Viacom, Scripps, Discovery, AMC and Time Warner, though in most cases talks are ongoing.\n\nKIDDING AROUND: On the eve of the \u201ckids\u201d upfront, Disney\u2019s networks and Viacom\u2019s Nickelodeon are feeling good about their prospects, reports Variety. The kids TV market, which is valued at $800 million in advance advertising commitments, is seeing early signs of strength from toy manufacturers and movie studios, Rita Ferro, president of ad sales for Disney ABC Television, told Variety. Ms. Ferro\u2019s group encompasses ABC, Freeform and a handful of kids-focused cable networks. In 2016\u2019s market, Disney\u2019s kids\u2019 properties, which include Disney Channel and Disney Junior, \u201csaw their combined volume of advance ad commitments rise by 20%.\u201d But Disney isn\u2019t resting on its laurels, especially as networks look for new ways to capture the increasing amount of digital and mobile viewership. Disney is touting new programming with variations on familiar figures and storylines, such as \u201cMuppet Babies\u201d and a new \u201cDuck Tales.\u201d It\u2019s also launching an app called \u201cDisney Now\u201d to make it easier to access various programs online.\n\nSNAP AD MATH: Snap describes itself as a camera company, but almost all of its revenue comes from advertising. As WSJ\u2019s Miriam Gottfried explains, investors need to keep that in mind as the company goes public and they try to assess its value. One way to forecast Snap\u2019s future growth is to use the time users spend on the app as a proxy for the share of ad dollars it should win relative to other companies, she writes, citing work by Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser. Assuming Snap gets one-tenth the usage of Facebook, for example, then if it got 10% of the social giant\u2019s ad dollars that would amount to $3.4 billion in U.S. ad revenue by 2021. A similar exercise that uses TV ad spending as the reference point would yield an estimate of $2.6 billion. Snap thinks it is playing a strong hand. The company is on track to price its IPO above the initial target of $14 to $16 a share, reports WSJ. Shares start trading Thursday.\n\nPROGRAMMATIC TIMES: Some publishers have been reluctant to go programmatic because of fear that they will leave money on the table. But more advertisers are demanding the ability to buy inventory through a more automated process. Now the New York Times has started selling its mobile and desktop video inventory programmatically, AdExchanger reports. The capability may streamline the process for advertisers who want to buy everything through their programmatic systems, but it won\u2019t necessarily create cost savings. The Times will charge similar CPMs for video inventory that\u2019s purchased programmatically compared to inventory bought through a direct deal.

Snap is seeking a potential valuation in its IPO of as much as $25 billion, and to help live up to that price tag, it needs major marketers to buy lots of ads.\n\nAdvertisers say they need data to help them justify shifting their budgets away from digital giants like Facebook and Google or more traditional vehicles like TV. Snap, which sells brands short video ads and location-linked overlays called \u201cgeofilters,\u201d reported revenue of $404.5 million in 2016, a fraction of Facebook\u2019s $27.6 billion in revenue.\n\nGiven the precedent set by the industry\u2019s two dominant players, Google and Facebook, advertisers are pushing for several other large digital ad platforms\u2014including Snapchat, Pinterest and Twitter \u2014to subject their advertising data collection processes to more third-party scrutiny, ideally audits by the MRC.\n\n\u201cCertainly, there\u2019ll be pressure on Snap, Twitter, Pinterest, any sort of closed-off, walled-garden platform,\u201d said Mitchell Weinstein, senior vice president of ad operations at the media buying firm IPG. \u201cWe have clients that will walk away from sites that don\u2019t offer independent metrics.\u201d\n\nSnap addressed the importance of third-party data vetting in its IPO filing, stating that \u201cadvertisers who were spending a lot of money on our products wanted verification that the advertisements they had purchased were actually delivered to our users.\u201d That led Snapchat to partner with several third-party ad measurement firms.\n\nHowever, like with Facebook and YouTube, advertisers would like the MRC to oversee and validate exactly how those third parties are collecting and crunching data from Snapchat.\n\nThe MRC has recently discussed the possibility of such an audit with both Pinterest and Twitter, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cThere have been early conversations between the MRC and several of the other large digital enterprises, but no commitments have been made or timetables set, despite the significance of these organizations within the digital advertising marketplace,\u201d said George Ivie, chief executive at the MRC.\n\nHe declined to comment about Snapchat specifically, and representatives for Snapchat also declined to comment.\n\nMeanwhile, the Association of National Advertisers, which had previously pushed Facebook to agree to an audit, said it plans to reach out to Snap regarding audits after the trade group\u2019s media conference later this week.\n\nDuring that event, Procter & Gamble \u2019s chief marketing officer, Marc Pritchard, again plans to press the industry to adopt transparent practices. In January, he told attendees at the Interactive Advertising Bureau\u2019s annual leadership meeting that \u201cthe days of giving digital a pass are over,\u201d and that it was time for industry to \u201cgrow up.\u201d\n\nEven as Facebook and Google have rolled out numerous third-party data partnerships, there has been a persistent feeling among buyers that both platforms have kept such data collection at arm\u2019s length, and still often serve as their own sources of key advertiser data.\n\nThe pressure on digital and social companies to succumb to audits continues to ramp up, particularly as executives like Mr. Pritchard keep pushing the topic.\n\n\u201cSnapchat will have to follow suit,\u201d said Eric Warburton, director of ad operations for the media buying agency Horizon Media. \u201cWith Procter & Gamble laying down the gauntlet\u2026and with Snap\u2019s impending IPO, they can\u2019t risk not having accreditation.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Ad Buyers Push Snapchat to Have Metrics Audited"}

The world will see whether a service that seems to pack all the necessary ingredients for digital media success in 2017 -- mobile know-how, millennial appeal, and an ad operation that looks like a threat to take TV ad dollars -- lives up to the considerable hype. Will investors keep the faith, or run away out of fear Facebook\u2019s Instagram is too potent a rival? Will Wall Street forgive slowing user growth and zero in on promising demographic usage trends? The company\u2019s shares priced Wednesday at $17 apiece, above the projected range, giving Snap an IPO valuation of nearly $24 billion -- among the biggest in the U.S. in recent years, The Wall Street Journal reports. Recode\u2019s Peter Kafka says Snap doesn\u2019t have one straightforward story or product to pitch investors and its core selling point may be its CEO, Evan Spiegel, \u201cand the notion he\u2019s a product savant\u201d who knows how to reach young users. Business Insider looks at the windfall for the insiders, including Mr. Spiegel ($4.49 billion) and fellow co-founder Bobby Murphy ($3.86 billion). They\u2019re not the only ones making money from Snap. Snap recently signed a $2 billion, five-year contract with Google for its cloud services, Recode reports. This morning WSJ will have a live blog on the Snap IPO.\n\nTWO MINUTE DRILL: Google isn\u2019t only interested in attracting subscription revenue with its new, $35-a-month YouTube TV bundle targeting cord-cutters. It\u2019s also going after the $70 billion U.S. TV ad market, reports CMO Today. Despite its usage growth, YouTube (like the rest of the online video field) has struggled to win over TV advertisers in a big way. The new service could give YouTube\u2019s efforts a boost. Analysts have speculated that Google may be able to sell about two minutes of commercial time for each hour of programming. In traditional pay TV those slots normally go to a regional cable operator who sells local spots to car dealerships and the like. But YouTube TV could potentially sell targeted ad inventory nationally. Scott Ferber, chief executive at the video ad tech firm Videology, said that if advertising proved lucrative on YouTube TV, he could see Google lowering the product\u2019s subscription rate to steal market share from competitors. Ad buyers warned that it will take some time for YouTube TV to scale.

Twitter on Wednesday outlined a number of ways it plans to proactively prevent abuse on its site, reports WSJ. The company, which historically has relied on users to flag abusive content, is now looking to \u201cidentify accounts as they\u2019re engaging in abusive behavior, even if this behavior hasn\u2019t been reported to us,\u201d said Ed Ho, Twitter\u2019s vice president of engineering, in a blog post. Google has also taken measures to tackle misinformation, but some wonder if that\u2019s enough. While the digital ad and search giant has taken steps to curb \u201cfake publishers that impersonate well-known news outlets,\u201d the company \u201ccontinues to profit from ads served on hundreds if not thousands of sites promoting propaganda, conspiracy theories, hoaxes and flat-out lies,\u201d reports MarketingLand. Google confirmed with MarketingLand that its policy only looks at whether a publisher is misrepresenting itself, versus whether or not an article is true. In other social action news, Facebook said it will use its technology to help identify posts by people with suicidal tendencies, reports Reuters. The move follows a New York Post story about a teenager who reportedly broadcast her suicide on Facebook Live.\n\nDIGITAL CNN: It\u2019s no secret that CNN president Jeff Zucker has ridden the wave of viewer interest in Donald Trump to boost the cable news network\u2019s ratings (much to his critics\u2019 chagrin). But as Hollywood Reporter notes in a cover story on CNN, Mr. Zucker has also been making a big play in digital, looking to outmaneuver fellow legacy media companies and new media upstarts alike. He\u2019s pouring resources into subject-oriented verticals like CNN Money and CNN Tech and has hired some 250 digital-focused staffers. CNN sites collectively draw an average of 105 million unique viewers a month across platforms, more than Yahoo, the New York Times and Huffington Post, the story notes. Digital profit at CNN was close to $150 million in 2016. Mr. Zucker is looking to build a $1 billion revenue digital business in five years. But ad-supported media can be unforgiving, so the task ahead is tough.

Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg Photo: Bloomberg News\n\nYouTube TV, Google\u2019s new skinny bundle of live-streaming broadcast and cable channels, is clearly the company\u2019s attempt to challenge traditional pay-TV distributors and appeal to cord-cutters.\n\nIt\u2019s also a backdoor for Google to squeeze its way into the traditional TV advertising business.\n\nGoogle has long wanted to steal a chunk of the more than $70 billion U.S. TV ad market. The company of late has clearly tried to position YouTube as a viable alternative for TV advertisers looking to reach young people, with limited success.\n\n\u201cGoogle doesn\u2019t grow into its market cap over time without taking a chunk of TV advertising,\u201d said Dave Morgan, chief executive at Simulmedia, a company that helps marketers use data to buy TV ads.\n\nEven as YouTube has announced staggering growth, with viewers watching more than 1 billion hours of video a day, \u201cit\u2019s hasn\u2019t impacted TV,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s down a single point in viewership. Advertising hasn\u2019t budged.\u201d\n\nNow, as part of the $35-a-month package of 40-plus channels that will roll out in the next few months, analysts have speculated that Google may have access to about two minutes of commercial time each hour to sell to advertisers on the cable networks featured in the service. It\u2019s the time typically allowed to cable providers such as Comcast Corp. , which runs local ads from marketers such as car dealerships and personal injury lawyers.\n\nWhile Maureen Bosetti, chief partnerships officer at the ad buying firm Initiative, said her team is still sorting through what YouTube TV will mean for clients, she said Google\u2019s motivation is clear.\n\n\u201cThey do want to take TV money,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to play in the TV space.\u201d\n\nYouTube TV will be available across the U.S., allowing it to sell ad inventory on a national basis, unlike cable operators that have geographic limitations. Plus, it should be able to use better targeting technology and vast reams of consumer data to deliver ads to specific audiences. It\u2019s an opportunity for Google to begin experimenting with selling linear TV advertising and potentially prove it can do so better than others.\n\n\u201cAs TV shifts from linear feeds to streams, we see an opportunity to improve the ads experience for everyone,\u201d said Neal Mohan, YouTube\u2019s chief product officer.\n\nSelling ads for the streaming service may also provide the side benefit of giving YouTube more credibility with marketers and helping them remove the stigma that its videos aren\u2019t the same quality as TV. That could draw more advertisers to the main YouTube site, said Ms. Bosetti.\n\nScott Ferber, chief executive at the video ad tech firm Videology, concurs. \u201cIf I\u2019m YouTube, I just got premium. I can package up the [user generated videos] and monetize the crap out of the long tail.\u201d\n\nThe details of YouTube TV and its ad strategy are far from clear. But analyst Michael Nathanson said Google\u2019s primary play with YouTube TV is to \u201cbreak into the in-home and television advertising market,\u201d selling targeted advertising in the network ad slots that typically go to cable operators.\n\nPhoto: YouTube\n\n\u201cIf they can offer advanced audience targeting on those two minutes, that\u2019s going to be a big win,\u201d said one buyer.\n\nAd buyers cautioned that it will take a while for YouTube TV to scale, meaning that the ad opportunity will be limited in 2017. And pricing will be a factor. Google has a history of aiming high when it launches new products, like it did with Google Preferred, its three-year old YouTube offering that lets advertisers pay to run ads only on the top 5% of YouTube\u2019s channels.\n\nAlphabet, which owns Google, doesn\u2019t break out YouTube\u2019s revenue and hasn\u2019t said whether the service is profitable.\n\nMany in the ad industry have been forecasting that as more TV gets delivered via the internet, the more that TV advertising will become \u201cdynamic\u201d like the web. That would mean different households and viewers could receive different ads based on their shopping history or what\u2019s going on in the world at a given moment.\n\nBut most broadcast and cable networks still sell the majority of their advertising on a national basis, and more targeted advertising could in theory put TV\u2019s high ad prices in jeopardy.\n\nThat tension played out almost a decade ago when Google launched a business that attempted to help networks sell TV ads by applying the same kind of technology and auction selling that has worked so well in search advertising\u2014only to shut it down a few years later.\n\n\u201cGoogle tried to brute force their way into the market. That failed miserably,\u201d said Habib Khoury, chief executive at Mass Exchange, a startup looking to bring more automation to TV advertising. \u201cSo this is a natural progression for them. The only place that makes sense to me for Google is in OTT. It aligns with how they do business.\u201d\n\nMr. Ferber said that if advertising proved lucrative on YouTube TV, he could see Google lowering the product\u2019s subscription rate to steal market share from competitors. \u201cI\u2019d be nervous if I\u2019m an MVPD,\u201d he said.

And as a result some are making more of their premium inventory available on ad exchanges--inventory that was traditionally only sold directly to agencies by sales teams.\n\n\u201cPublishers have good reason to open up their very best inventory to automated auctions,\u201d said Jeremy Hlavacek, vice president of global automated monetization at The Weather Company. \u201cThere\u2019s no turning back.\u201d\n\nIn the past few months, USA Today has embraced header bidding for its sports properties. Chris Pirrone, general manager at USA Today Sports Media Group, said he now has eight new ad tech partners bidding on his digital ad space, and is selling more top inventory programmatically. \u201cI now have a ton of new demand,\u201d he said.\n\nAll of this raises a question: do publishers still need as many salespeople long-term? Are machines finally going to replace people in digital advertising?\n\nNot anytime soon, say industry executives. Larger media companies still need to convince ad buyers that their sites are relevant and audiences are worth targeting, which requires salespeople. And many still derive significant revenue from selling premium ads like video and custom content directly, said Eric Franchi, co-founder of the digital ad firm Undertone.\n\n\u201cIn advertising relationships remain important,\u201d said Mr. Pirrone, who added that he isn\u2019t cutting down his salesforce.\n\nAt the same time, given the complexity of the business, media companies may need fewer generalists on their sales teams -- people focused on bulk display deals -- and more specialists in analyzing data, managing yield for multiple partners and selling agencies on the various programmatic channels a company has to offer.\n\nMichael Smith, senior vice president of advertising platforms and core audience at Hearst, rattled off eight different ways his company sells digital ads to marketers. That list encompasses several different flavors of programmatic, including header bidding.\n\nThat complexity is not exactly a prescription for reducing headcount.\n\n\u201cOver time programmatic should simplify,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for now, we need to serve advertisers in any and every way they want to buy from us.\u201d\n\nMr. Smith said his sales team has not shrunk over time. In fact, executing a given ad buy might involve a media sales person, a programmatic sales person, and a \u201csales engineer,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s not uncommon, say media executives, even as programmatic has surged. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely plausible there are more bodies not less needed in digital sales,\u201d said Jim Spanfeller, chief executive at The Spanfeller Media Group, which operates sites like The Daily Meal.\n\nRaw data is hard to come by, but according to LinkedIn, through the first eight months of 2016, 14% of all job openings in online media were in sales--the same level tracked through the first eight months of last year. However, those figures may be driven by new entrants in digital media. LinkedIn says when it looked at just the same set of companies it tracked in 2015, there were 2% fewer sales job openings year-over-year.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the marketplace won\u2019t eventually change. \u201cI think header bidding gets the programmatic industry very close to its ultimate mission, an equal auction for all inventory,\u201d said Mr. Hlavacek. \u201cOnce that happens industry-wide, I do think it will spur changes [to sales organizations].\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "More Publishers Embrace Header Bidding But Digital Sales Teams Endure"}

The company launched a header bidding feature in October.\n\n\u201cWe initially thought that header bidding was a solution that would have had a short existence based on historical trends we witnessed in early years of the business. This was a misread of the market on our part,\u201d said Frank Addante, chief executive at Rubicon Project.\n\nExecutives from online ad firm Criteo were also quizzed about the technology on the company\u2019s earnings call Wednesday, and Chief Executive Eric Eichmann warned investors that it may have to pay more to acquire ad space as publishers adopt the technology.\n\nSo, what exactly is header bidding?\n\nHeader bidding technology is complicated, but the benefit for website publishers is simple: It allows publishers to squeeze more revenue from the ad space they sell through auction-based \u201cprogrammatic\u201d ad systems.\n\nHow does it do this? In simple terms, header bidding creates greater competition among ad buyers bidding against each other to serve ads to users on publishers\u2019 sites. It\u2019s the latest advancement in selling advertising through automated ad exchanges.\n\nBefore, when a webpage was loaded by a user, a publisher might offer ad impressions on that page for sale through an auction system known as an ad exchange. If the ad impression didn\u2019t sell, or didn\u2019t meet a reserve price set by the publisher for that impression, the publisher might subsequently offer it for sale through a different exchange provided by a different company.\n\nThis practice is often referred to as a \u201cdaisychain\u201d approach, because a single ad impression might be offered for sale on four or five ad exchanges, in sequence, before it eventually sells. (All of this activity occurs in fractions of a second as a webpage is loading.)\n\nHeader bidding, however, allows publishers to break this daisychain and instead have various ad exchanges effectively compete against each other in the auction process at the same time. This can help drive up the ad prices collected by publishers and help ensure fewer of their ad impressions go unsold.\n\nSome publishers and ad buyers also believe header bidding can help negate advantages afforded to Google because of its popular ad-serving technology DoubleClick, which many online publishers use to place advertising on their pages. Google also operates its own ad exchange, which is integrated closely with its DoubleClick ad-serving technology. Some ad tech executives say this gives the online ad giant\u2019s exchange an advantage over others.\n\nOnline publishers have gravitated to header-bidding solutions in recent years and toward ad tech companies that offer the feature because the technology helps them extract more revenue from their ad space.\n\nSome ad tech providers have been quicker to adopt the technology than others, hence investors\u2019 concerns over Rubicon Project\u2019s statements this week.\n\nCompanies that do offer header bidding technology say demand for those products is increasing.\n\nWrite to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "What Is Header Bidding, and Why Does Wall Street Care?"}

This has directed more traffic to those AMP pages and less to publishers\u2019 full mobile websites. Google said in a Sept. 21 blog post that AMP search results would be introduced across search engine results pages worldwide \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nFor some publishers that is a problem, since their AMP pages do not currently generate advertising revenue at the same rate as their full mobile sites. Multiple publishers said an AMP pageview currently generates around half as much revenue as a pageview on their full mobile websites.\n\nThat\u2019s largely because of limitations related to the types of ad units AMP pages will allow and the ad technology providers that are currently integrated with the platform, those publishers say.\n\nFor example, AMP pages rely heavily on standardized banner ad units, and don\u2019t allow publishers to sell highly-customized ad units, sponsorships or pop-up ads as they might on their own properties.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar dynamic to the one many publishing executives described in the early days of Facebook \u2019s Instant Articles platform, which enables publishers to post content directly to the social network. Facebook eventually tweaked some of its advertising policies in an attempt to address those concerns.\n\nGoogle\u2019s vice president of news, Richard Gingras, said the company is happy with the progress AMP has made in terms of the ad capabilities it offers publishers.\n\nHowever, he believes some publishers are failing to wring maximum revenue from their AMP traffic because of the way their advertising technology systems are implemented. Publishers that make full use of the ad tools available to them in AMP are seeing revenue results comparable to what they earn on their full mobile web pages, he said.\n\n\u201cWe want to drive the ecosystem forward, but obviously these things don\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d Mr. Gingras said. \u201cThe objective of AMP is to have it drive more revenue for publishers than non-AMP pages. We\u2019re not there yet\u201d.\n\nPublishers who are critical of AMP were reluctant to speak publicly about their frustrations, or to remove their AMP content. One executive said he would not comment on the record for fear that Google might \u201cturn some knob that hurts the company.\u201d\n\nA website\u2019s ranking in Google\u2019s search results isn\u2019t impacted by whether it has AMP pages, Mr. Gingras reiterated.\n\nStill, some publishers believe an eventual prioritization of AMP pages is inevitable.\n\n\u201cPublishers who are not using AMP will probably be penalized,\u201d said Philippe Guelton, chief executive of SheKnows Media.\n\nPublishers who were willing to speak on the record were generally happy with AMP. They acknowledged the shift in traffic from their full mobile sites to AMP pages, but have a positive outlook on AMP\u2019s ad revenue potential.\n\nVisits to CNN\u2019s AMP pages are beginning to replace visits to the full version of its mobile website. CNN has seen an 80% increase in AMP traffic since September, and more than 20% of search traffic to CNN now directs to AMP pages, according to CNN chief product officer Alex Wellen.\n\nFor CNN, visits to its full mobile site and its AMP pages \u201clargely monetize at the same rate,\u201d Mr. Wellen said, although that could change as it begins to introduce more ad formats to its mobile web pages.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need assurances from Google that the AMP pages can accommodate these executions; otherwise, we\u2019ll have to reevaluate whether the economic and product tradeoffs make sense,\u201d he said.\n\nVox Media\u2019s The Verge has witnessed a similar trend, according to a recent post published by Editor-in-chief Nilay Patel. As The Verge\u2019s AMP pageviews have increased, pageviews to its full website are decreasing. AMP represented 14% of traffic to The Verge in September, Mr. Patel said.\n\nThe Washington Post is able to generate approximately the same amount of revenue from AMP pages as it can from pageviews on its full mobile site, according to its director of product, Joey Marburger. Some 15% of mobile traffic to The Washington Post is now directed to AMP pages, he said.\n\nMr. Guelton said SheKnows \u201cdoesn\u2019t really mind\u201d if search traffic is directed to AMP pages or the full version of its site, since it can generate ad revenue in both places.\n\nIn terms of ad limitations within AMP pages, Mr. Guelton suggested those are necessary to fulfil AMP\u2019s promise of improving the user experience by loading content faster.\n\n\u201cConsumers are indicating that they want a better experience overall, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a negative,\u201d Mr. Guelton said.\n\nWrite to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Google AMP Gets Mixed Reviews From Publishers"}

But it turns out that commercial time is getting a boost as well.\n\nThe ad tech company Innovid, which delivers ads to web video outlets as well as a growing number of TV apps such as Fox Now, Hulu and Crackle, says the share of ads delivered through its platform to connected TVs quadrupled this year.\n\nAnd according to Modi Media, an ad buying division focused on new forms of TV advertising within GroupM, over 37 million U.S. households watched ad-supported shows on connected TVs over the past year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a huge explosion of growth,\u201d said Seth Walters, a senior partner at Modi. \u201cWe\u2019ve leaned into connected TV in a big way.\u201d\n\nThe nascent connected TV ad market is worth watching, since TV networks see the medium as a way to reach cord-cutters and people who just don\u2019t watch much live linear TV. Marketers also hold out hopes that ad-supported connected TV may potentially blend the best of TV advertising\u2014premium content and big audiences\u2014with digital advertising\u2019s precision targeting.\n\nTo be sure, growth is coming from a minuscule base for now, say ad buyers.\n\nFor example, eMarketer\u2014which is known for chronicling spending across the advertising industry\u2014has yet to issue a report on spending for this ad market.\n\nIt\u2019s also tough to get consensus on what counts as connected TV. For instance, many ad buyers exclude mobile consumption of TV content, such as on Watch ESPN on mobile devices, as they view ads delivered on a big screen in the living room as a distinct viewing and advertising experience. One buyer estimated that his agency\u2019s 2016 spending on connected TV advertising would land in the 8-figure range and is expanding quickly.\n\nThat growth is likely to continue as people\u2019s consumption habits evolve rapidly. Consider NBCUniversal, which found that during the third quarter of this year connected TV viewing of prime-time shows accounted for 24% of the digital video viewing that was initiated across all platforms, including cable TV. Two years ago that number was just 4%. (NBCU counts video on-demand content delivered via set top boxes as connected TV, along with viewing on Hulu and NBC\u2019s sites and apps. Not every player in the media business considers VOD part of the connected TV segment).\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that NBCU benefited from people streaming tons of Summer Olympics content during that period this year. But according to Krishan Bhatia, executive vice president of business operations and strategy for NBCU\u2019s advertising sales and client partnerships, roughly three-quarters of that consumption is being driven by prime-time entertainment shows like \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d For some shows, digital viewing, including connected TV streaming, accounts for 30% to 40% of their viewership among adults 18 to 49, he said.\n\nAdvertisers are attracted to OTT because it blends attributes of premium TV advertising and digital media\u2019s precision. \u201cIt sits in a really sweet spot,\u201d said Arun Kumar, global president of Cadreon, a digital ad buying arm of IPG Mediabrands. \u201cIt allows advertisers to be more targeted in an environment that feels good. There is genuinely a lot of interest across all clients.\u201d\n\nStill, Mr. Kumar noted that buying ads on connected TVs is fragmented and measurement is in its infancy\u2014two factors that could stifle growth. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the wild west,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, who ends up settling this frontier is a big open question. Right now, some OTT ad inventory is sold as part of big upfront TV packages alongside traditional cable and broadcast ad time. Some is sold by companies like Roku or ad tech middlemen. And in a few cases, these ads are purchased programmatically.\n\nAccording to Jonathan Bokor, senior vice president and director of advanced media at the Publicis -owned media buying division Mediavest/Spark, the entire TV market will eventually all be OTT advertising. Digital buyers would prefer to purchase these ads via software and hope to avoid paying prime-time TV prices, he said.\n\n\u201cHow connected TV ads get bought and sold over the long haul is subject to debate,\u201d Mr. Bokor said. \u201cWe want it to be programmatic. TV companies want to make it incremental to their Nielsen ratings for traditional TV, in order to remedy the decline in ratings.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "More Ads Are Being Delivered Via Connected TVs"}

Morgan is putting \u200bits ad buyer\u2019s work on the bank\u2019s $250 million annual \u200bad-buying account on hold. Photo: timothy a. clary/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nJ.P. Morgan Chase Chief Marketing Officer Kristin Lemkau joined a meeting in May of some 25 marketing executives at Manhattan\u2019s Millennium Broadway Hotel to hear a confidential presentation on the disturbing state of the advertising business.\n\nCorporate investigations firm K2 Intelligence revealed that a seven-month probe it conducted had uncovered that ad agencies are getting rebates from media companies in the U.S., but these firms aren\u2019t telling their clients or passing along the savings, according to several people who attended the meeting.\n\nThat prompted Ms. Lemkau to launch an audit of J.P. Morgan\u2019s ad buyer and temporarily halt the agency\u2019s work on the bank\u2019s $250 million annual ad-buying account, according to people familiar with the matter. \u200b\n\nShe is one of a number of marketers scrambling to respond to K2\u2019s probe, which was done on behalf of the Association of National Advertisers, a trade group. The report, released in early June, detailed a range of practices including rebates, the fogginess of prices agencies pay for inventory, and conflicts of interest arising from agencies\u2019 investments.\n\nGeneral Electric Co. recently sent a letter to its agencies alerting them it had hired outside counsel to conduct an audit because of the ANA report, according to people familiar with the matter. Sears Holdings Corp. , and Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. also are auditing their agencies, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nThe ANA report also exposed the holes in many agency contracts, which marketers are now trying to plug. AT&T Inc., Allstate Corp. , Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., Fidelity Investments, Heineken USA and U.S. Cellular Corp. are among those trying to get more liberal auditing rights such as the right to audit individual divisions of the holding company or tougher language in new contracts with their agencies, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe revelations have strained trust between marketers and agencies in the nearly $540 billion global ad marketplace.\n\n\u201cThere is trouble in paradise in this industry and anybody that says there is not has their head in the sand,\u201d said a chief marketing officer at one of the largest companies in the U.S. \u201cThe thing to do is trust but verify.\u201d\n\nThe ANA report didn\u2019t name companies alleged to have engaged in nontransparent practices. K2 said in the report that some of the activity it discovered was permitted under the contracts agencies and marketers have. The investigators said determining whether U.S. laws were violated was outside its scope. The big ad-agency holding companies, including Publicis, WPP PLC, Omnicom Group Inc. and Interpublic Group of Cos., have been on the defensive, and have asked the ANA to provide information related to their specific agencies.\n\nThe controversy spotlights how complex and opaque the ad business has become after two decades of mergers that produced a handful of giant companies with hundreds of firms under their umbrellas. Although the industry is best-known for its creative prowess\u2014glamorized in the TV series \u201cMad Men\u201d\u2014it is the media-buying business that has been the most profitable for ad conglomerates.\n\nOver the past few years, as clients have pushed to cut agency fees, ad companies expanded aggressively into new businesses such as principle buying, in which ad firms use their own money to buy ad time and then resell it to their clients. They also built and acquired companies that specialize in automated ad buying and use technology and data to buy targeted digital ads across the web.\n\nThese changes have made it more difficult for marketers to track how much they are paying for ad space across media platforms, partly because some of those new companies don\u2019t disclose ad pricing to the marketers that sign up to use such services.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that the holding companies are so large, interconnected and incestuous that it is very easy to have very little transparency in that world,\u201d Joe Tripodi, chief marketing officer of Subway, which is incorporated as Doctor\u2019s Associates, said in an interview last year.\n\nAfter the ANA report was released, Ms. Lemkau called Steve King, a top executive at Publicis, whose Zenith Media unit handles the bulk of J.P. Morgan\u2019s media buying. She told him the bank was conducting an audit and putting the agency\u2019s business on hold until the audit was complete, according to people familiar with the matter. Business Insider earlier reported J.P. Morgan\u2019s audit.\n\nDuring the call, which was friendly in tone, Ms. Lemkau said she had an obligation to the bank to find out the facts, while Mr. King said the company was eager to clear its name and pledged full cooperation with the audit, one of the people familiar with the situation said.\n\n\u201cWe have to find out the facts in our case,\u201d said Patricia Wexler, a J.P. Morgan spokeswoman. Ms. Wexler said that Zenith has been \u201ccooperative\u201d with the process.\n\n\u201cAudits are a part of normal course of business,\u201d Publicis Groupe said. \u201cAs always, we have been collaborative on the client audit process and expect a satisfactory conclusion.\u201d\n\nA few weeks after the call, Ms. Lemkau gave Zenith back some media-buying duties, allowing the firm to handle TV buys for the fourth and first quarters, one of the people said.\n\nThere have been hiccups in the auditing process. After weeks of negotiations, Publicis agreed to allow J.P. Morgan to see additional information later this month but won't allow the bank\u2019s auditing firms to be present, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nRon Amram, vice president of media marketing at Heineken USA, said advertisers need to know far more about the intricate arrangements ad agencies have with internet companies. They pay the tech firms for ad space but also receive technology services from them, Mr. Amram said.\n\nTo follow the money nowadays, he said, \u201cyou don\u2019t need a generalist anymore; you need a proctologist.\u201d\n\nWrite to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Big Marketers Launch Audits of Their Ad Buyers"}

Less than two weeks ago, Facebook also announced it had agreed to have some of its ad metrics audited by the MRC.\n\nSpecifically, Google said the MRC will audit the way that three independent metrics companies\u2014Moat, Integral Ad Science and DoubleVerify\u2014collect data measuring whether video ads are viewable on YouTube and how long they are viewed. Those audits will evaluate everything from the technology being used and how it\u2019s integrated on YouTube\u2019s website and app to the way the data is crunched.\n\nIn addition, Google plans to have the MRC audit data for ads on non-Google sites purchased via two key Google ad buying tech platforms\u2014AdWords and DoubleClick Bid Manager.\n\nThese audits should be welcome news in the digital ad industry, where marketers have been pushing for more transparency and overall assurance that the ads they pay for end up where they are supposed to and can be seen by consumers.\n\nCompanies like Google and Facebook, which dominate the online ad industry, have faced criticisms that they have been \u201cgrading their own homework\u201d because they have traditionally collected and self-reported so much of their own viewer data. While marketers lean on third-party metrics companies that have approval to work with the platforms, those metrics firms aren't always allowed to directly do their own measurements and instead receive and record data provided to them by YouTube or Facebook.\n\n\u201cOur data has to be trusted and comprehensive. We are very in tune with the idea,\u201d said Babak Pahlavan, Google\u2019s senior director of product management, analytics solutions and measurement. Mr. Pahlavan said that Google\u2019s move had been in the works for years and wasn't a reaction to industry pressure or Facebook\u2019s recent announcement.\n\nGiven YouTube\u2019s scale (it reaches a billion people and every day its users stream hundreds of millions of hours of videos), it\u2019s a massive challenge to conduct such integrations, but the goal is to complete the process over the next two quarters, Mr. Pahlavan added.\n\nHe noted that Google has already had 30 of its various ad metrics audited by the MRC\u2014including for several other YouTube ad products\u2014and has been working with the measurement standard-bearer for more than a decade. \u201cWe\u2019ve been investing in trust for a long time,\u201d he said.\n\nOver the past several years, a large number of media companies have agreed to work with third parties like Moat or DoubleVerify to track viewability data. And these third parties have individually been audited by the MRC.\n\nBut because giant platforms like YouTube and Facebook have been reluctant to implement third party tracking code from these vendors directly, there has been some ongoing frustration in the ad buying community that these companies\u2019 data is less transparent than others.\n\nOn top of that, Facebook has had a number of embarrassing data tracking mishaps, adding to the noise surrounding third party measurement and fueling the idea that the web\u2019s biggest ad platforms play by their own rules.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening now is that this data is generally in the control of large platforms, and it\u2019s a little bit of a black box,\u201d said DoubleVerify President and Chief Executive Wayne Gattinella, who added that his company has been working on helping Google provide more transparent metrics for roughly a year.\n\n\u201cThe market is saying, \u2018We want to ensure that the process [these companies employ] is understood, and is documented and accurate. Otherwise, it could be garbage in garbage out, and we\u2019re not able to determine that.\u2019 So this is all good news.\u201d\n\nBob Liodice, chief executive of the Association of National Advertisers, a trade group for marketers, agreed and called Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s recent audit commitments \u201ca turning point.\u201d\n\nMr. Liodice said that last year\u2019s bombshell report on the overall lack of transparent practices in the ad agency world, along with a recent speech by Procter & Gamble \u2019s Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard calling for the industry to clean up its act, have combined to elevate the data transparency issue.\n\n\u201cThe digital media supply chain is in bad shape, and people are taking good hard looks, asking, \u2018Is this the best way to spend my money?\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Liodice said he hopes Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s moves help put more advertisers\u2019 minds at ease and potentially demystify the way they operate.\n\n\u201cWhy would you want to be called a walled garden?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a horrible reputation to have.

Surely, marketers are chasing this migration of mostly young viewers by diverting huge chunks of their television advertising budgets to digital video.\n\nBut, for the most part, that\u2019s not happening.\n\nFacebook and Snapchat get all the buzz these days with their billions of daily video views, but there\u2019s really just one game in town when it comes to winning over any TV marketing money to the Web\u2014YouTube.\n\nYouTube has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of advertisers shifting spending from TV to chase viewers who have migrated to online video, but even the Google platform is siphoning away only a small fraction of marketers\u2019 media budgets. YouTube faces several nagging challenges that are holding it back from capturing more TV revenue, including pricing concerns, the way agencies are structured and lingering doubts over the quality of its content, according to ad buyers.\n\nYouTube\u2019s struggles to go the extra mile offer a cautionary tale of the obstacles that could be awaiting the slew of new Web video entrants looking to capitalize on traditional TV\u2019s much-hyped demise.\n\n\u201cWeb-only properties are still making a case for a seat at that [TV budget] table versus sitting at the kids table,\u201d said Adam Shlachter, president of VM1 at ad buying agency Zenith Media. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will change drastically this year.\u201d\n\nOverall spending on TV advertising is forecast to rise 0.5% to $63 billion this year, excluding the Olympics and political spending, according to the research and ad buying firm Magna Global.\n\nMeanwhile, Web video advertising is expected to rise 28% to $9.8 billion in 2016, according to eMarketer, still a fraction of the money spent on TV. Even though advertising on Web video is growing rapidly, ad buyers say this growth is mostly not coming at the expense of TV.\n\n\u201cYou only have to look at the revenue at a number of TV companies to realize you have not seen a wholesale transfer of dollars,\u201d said Rob Norman, GroupM\u2019s chief digital officer. \u201cBut of the new platforms, unlike Facebook and Snapchat, the one most likely to unlock TV dollars is YouTube.\u201d\n\nYouTube is the reigning king of Web video with $1.2 billion in ad revenue in 2014, or about 21% of the total spent on online video ads in the U.S. that year. This year, YouTube is expected to reel in about $2 billion, but its market share will shrink slightly to 20% as more and more companies try to get into Web video, says eMarketer. YouTube\u2019s video ad growth, in addition to stealing some spending away from TV, is bolstered by rising digital budgets and money shifting out of print and display.\n\nThe scale of spending on digital video platforms like YouTube still pales in comparison to the TV behemoth. And, it turns out, there are several specific factors that ad buyers say are holding it back.\n\nAds on YouTube can cost between $15 and $20 per thousand people reached in key demographics, according to ad buyers. Those prices are higher than the average prices for commercials on cable networks, which can cost closer to $10, and comparable to prime-time ads on cable, these buyers say.\n\nThe problem with that level of pricing is that some media buyers and their ad clients don\u2019t consider YouTube content to be of the same quality as top-tier cable programming, let alone a prime-time broadcast show.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that YouTube programming in aggregate speaks to a sizable, passionate, engaged young audience,\u201d said Kris Magel, President, U.S. at the ad buying firm Initiative, adding that YouTube competes with Comedy Central or Adult Swim for some brand\u2019s budgets.\n\n\u201cThat connection and engagement is worth a lot to a youth-targeted marketer,\u201d Mr. Magel said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not limitless. You have to price competitively to be in the consideration set.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, YouTube never has a chance to compete for TV budgets. Some marketers still view digital media and TV as completely separate entities that warrant separate budgets. Thus, some TV ad buyers may not even have the ability to move money from a TV network to YouTube because those budgets are managed separately.\n\n\u201cFew advertisers have subscribed to the idea that their budgets are fully fluid,\u201d said Dave Campanelli, senior vice president and director of national broadcast at the agency Horizon Media.\n\nOver the past few years YouTube has\u2014at times, reluctantly\u2014done everything it can to make buying ads on its platform as similar to TV as possible, from the research it provides to the sheer mechanics of executing ad campaigns.\n\nPewDiePie, aka Felix Kjellberg, is a big YouTube star Photo: YouTube\n\nOne of the main arguments for advertising on YouTube is the platform\u2019s established legitimacy as an entertainment destination for young people. YouTube, which has birthed a generation of creators who for many consumers are bigger than movie and TV stars, reaches a billion people each month on average.\n\nAccording to Google, Nielsen recently found that the service reached more people between the ages of 18 and 49 on mobile devices alone than any TV network in December of last year, while comScore found that 44% of YouTube viewers in that age bracket don\u2019t watch prime-time broadcast TV in an average week.\n\nAs a result, Tara Levy, YouTube\u2019s managing director, agency sales, said YouTube is in conversations with many advertisers well in advance of the TV upfront selling season, a marked difference from recent years. The upfront negotiating period, when many TV networks try to lock in ad commitments in advance, kicks off in earnest in a few weeks.\n\n\u201cEverything is just down (in TV),\u201d said Ed McLoughlin, global head of media and digital at HP. Mr. McLoughlin said that the majority of HP\u2019s video ad budgets are now directed toward digital media, and half of the company\u2019s digital media spending is on YouTube. \u201cI see that number going up,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile YouTube\u2019s experience offers some lessons for digital video rivals, companies like Facebook and Snapchat are still seen as behind YouTube when it comes to winning over slices of those TV ad budgets, despite each boasting of delivering 8 billion video views each day and viral moments like 800,000 people watching an exploding watermelon live on Facebook.\n\nSome of that has to do to with the fact that YouTube has simply been at this longer. Facebook and Snapchat have seen their video numbers explode in the past few years.\n\nBut ad buyers say they fundamentally view the way video is consumed on those platforms differently. While YouTube theoretically allows an advertiser to run its ads alongside popular content or talent (it feels a lot more similar to running ads on TV networks and shows), it\u2019s worth pointing out that a huge portion of the video views on Facebook and Snapchat are from user-produced videos that carry no advertising.\n\nAnd pushing an ad into someone\u2019s social media feed is seen as potentially more intrusive for some buyers compared with TV or YouTube where users expect to see ads alongside video content.\n\n\u201cThe more personal an experience, the harder it is to bring in ad messaging in an acceptable way,\u201d said John Swift, Omnicom Media Group \u2019s chief executive of North American investment. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean the potential isn\u2019t huge.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also harder to compare Web video ads with TV ads from a pricing and effectiveness perspective, say buyers. While all of these large Web outlets have taken steps to enable tracking from third-party researchers like Nielsen, advertisers say it\u2019s still difficult to make apples-to-apples comparisons on basics like how many people will a Snapchat or Twitter campaign reach versus one on TV.\n\nMany major marketers also have decades of evidence showing how TV ads impact sales. This is something YouTube has just started tracking.\n\n\u201cMeasurement is still a challenge,\u201d said Christina Norman, chief executive at the media agency Media Storm. \u201cYou need to be able to go to your client or boss and say, I spent X money on this platform and got Y back.\u201d\n\nSnapchat, in particular, is still seen by many advertisers as experimental, and its very young user base isn\u2019t crucial for every brand. Snapchat\u2019s ad prices are also in the neighborhood of premium cable, which makes experimentation challenging for cautious brands.\n\nFacebook\u2019s ad prices are reasonable on the surface, said Mike Law, executive vice president and managing director of video investment at the agency Amplifi U.S. Facebook counts video views after a person watches for just three seconds, though marketers can elect to pay only for video ads that are viewed for at least 10 seconds.\n\nRegardless, ad buyers often make their own calculations based on how many people watch video ads in their entirety. Based on those calculations, Facebook\u2019s prices can look even higher than prime-time TV, he said. \u201cWe view them less as a TV replacement,\u201d Mr. Law said.\n\nEven with TV ratings not what they used to be, marketers are finding that replacing TV isn't an easy task.\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "YouTube\u2019s Quest for TV Advertising Dollars"}

Currently, publishers are permitted to charge marketers for this \u201csponsored content\u201d and keep all the revenue.\n\nThe new Instagram Stories ads sold by Instagram are very Snapchat like: the placements are full screen vertical videos that can run for 15-seconds, or static photos that run for five seconds.

Bryan Goldberg, chief executive at the women-aimed digital outlet Bustle, noted that producing such content is \u201cnot simple\u201d and is different from shooting photos that can be used in Instagram\u2019s traditional feed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still really early days on Instagram,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really helps publishers build their brand. It\u2019s not yet at the center of our revenue strategy.\u201d\n\nMr. Goldberg said that Bustle\u2019s audience on Instagram has surged from 200,000 to close to 1.4 million over the past year. That should make the publisher\u2019s Instagram Stories appealing to brands looking to do sponsored content.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they opened the door with ads should lead to more things down the road,\u201d Mr. Goldberg added.\n\nBustle has been active publishing Instagram Stories Photo: Bustle\n\nOne publishing executive said he was surprised that Instagram didn\u2019t launch a revenue share program for Stories as part of the ad rollout, simply to put pressure on Snapchat.

Given that Facebook has started testing mid-roll ads in videos, that could signal a similar move by Instagram down the road.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. von Borries is also bullish on the creative potential for doing Stories on behalf of paying marketers.\n\n\u201cInstagram Stories are a lot more organic, and the content tends to be very loose and experimental,\u201d he said.

Photo: Reuters\n\nThe Association of National Advertisers said its probe of the advertising business found that rebates and other nontransparent practices are \u201cpervasive\u201d in the U.S., raising alarms about how ad agencies conduct business throughout the industry.\n\nThe trade group, which represents big advertisers such as AT&T Inc., General Motors Co. and Procter & Gamble Co., said that advertising companies are being rewarded with cash rebates from media companies for spending a certain amount on behalf of clients.\n\nThe marketing trade group revealed on Tuesday the outcome of the eight-month probe conducted by corporate investigations firm K2 Intelligence, confirming a report by The Wall Street Journal last week.\n\nThe ANA\u2019s report said that senior executives across the agency ecosystem were aware of, and mandated, some nontransparent business practices. The ANA said its study revealed \u201cevidence of a fundamental disconnect in the advertising industry regarding the basic nature of the advertising agency relationship.\u201d\n\nRelated Association of National Advertisers Transparency Study Report\n\nThe study said that nontransparent practices were discovered across digital, print, outdoor, television and other media.\n\nThe ANA found that agencies were given cash rebates by media companies based on the amount they spent on advertising. The study found instances in which media suppliers paid rebates to agencies, or entities affiliated with those agencies, in amounts ranging from 1.67% to approximately 20% of aggregate media spending.\n\nMoreover, it said that advertisers who were interviewed as part of its study were \u201cunaware of any rebates being returned.\u201d Rebates were also given in the form of free media inventory credits.\n\nIn some cases, rebates were structured as \u201cservice agreements\u201d in which media companies paid ad agencies for research or consulting activities, often tied to the volume of the ad agency\u2019s spending.\n\nThe probe also found nontransparent business practices in the U.S. market in situations in which holding companies had equity stakes in media suppliers. The study said \u201cseveral former senior-level agency employees\u201d reported that they \u201cfelt pressure\u201d from senior executives to direct ad spending to media companies in which their own company had invested.\n\n\u201cThe media business system is not transparent and marketers are not getting full disclosure on the information they need to make informed\u201d media decisions, said Bob Liodice, ANA\u2019s chief executive.\n\nThe 58-page report, which anonymized the identities of individuals and advertising agencies, laid out the ways ad companies used the buying power of their advertiser clients for their own benefit.\n\nSome experts believe the most likely fallout from the report will be that marketers and agencies rework their contracts.\n\nBut it is possible some of the practices amounted to a breach of contract or a breach of fiduciary relationship, according to Linda A. Goldstein, a partner and chair of the advertising and media division at law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips.\n\nBob Cauley, co-founder of Beekman Associates, a New York firm that advises marketers on agency compensation, said most marketers are unlikely to draw attention by pursuing any legal remedies. \u201cIf I am a marketer, the last thing I want to do is admit I screwed up a contract,\u201d Mr. Cauley said, adding that most advertisers will likely look to privately improve contracts.\n\nAdvertising editor Suzanne Vranica joins the WSJ Media Mix podcast to explain the new report about the pervasive lack of transparency in the ad business.\n\nRichard Plansky, executive managing director of K2, said that some of the activity his firm discovered was \u201cpermitted by contracts\u201d but didn\u2019t say if any practices violated U.S. laws. \u201cWhether or not any of it was illegal was beyond the scope of what we were asked to do,\u201d he said on a call with reporters.\n\nThe ad business is dominated by six ad holding companies\u2014WPP PLC, Omnicom Group Inc., Publicis Groupe SA, Interpublic Group of Cos., Dentsu Inc. and Havas SA. Combined, the six firms control roughly $250 billion in ad dollars, about 50% of global media spending, estimates Brian Wieser, senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group.\n\nThe probe found evidence of nontransparent business practices at ad holding companies as well as \u201ccertain independent agencies.\u201d\n\nAd companies including Publicis, Interpublic, WPP and Omnicom have criticized the trade group for not calling out individual bad actors, thereby painting the entire industry with a similar brush. The agencies have broadly denied any wrongdoing, and some have asked the trade group to provide any information related to their specific agencies.\n\nThe American Association of Advertising Agencies, which represents ad agencies, said \u201ca healthy and constructive debate about media buying can only happen with a bipartisan, engaged, industrywide approach\u2014and that is precisely the opposite of what the ANA has pursued. The immense shortcomings of the K2 report released today\u2014anonymous, inconclusive, and one-sided\u2014undercut the integrity of its findings.\u201d\n\nAs part of the study, the ANA looked at so-called principal transactions, in which an agency holding company acts as a media supplier by buying media time and then reselling it at a markup to an advertiser. In these transactions, the original purchase price is typically not disclosed.\n\nThe study found that markups on media sold in this manner can range from 30% to 90%. Plus, media buyers are sometimes pressured or incentivized by their agency holding companies to direct client spend to this media, regardless of whether such purchases are in the clients\u2019 best interest, according to the report.\n\nIn fact, the ANA\u2019s study came about because advertisers have been worried that agencies don\u2019t have their best interests at heart and could be allocating ad dollars in ways that are most beneficial to the agencies and not the clients. In 2014, the ANA and Forrester Research conducted a survey of about 150 senior marketers and found 46% of those polled expressed concern about the transparency of their media buys.\n\nWhile questions about the existence of rebates in the U.S. have percolated for years, the issue boiled anew last year when Jon Mandel, who had previously been chief executive of WPP\u2019s ad buying agency MediaCom, told a room full of marketers at an ANA conference that agency rebates are now widespread across the industry.\n\nDocuments cited in the ANA\u2019s report include things such as emails between agency executives and media companies in which rebates were discussed in detail.\n\nRebates or agency-volume bonuses\u2014in cash, free ad space or other services-\u2014are a common business practice in Europe and countries such as China and Brazil, according to advertising executives and auditing firms. But, historically, they haven\u2019t been part of the way U.S. advertising deals work.\n\nWrite to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Ad Business Full of Nontransparent Practices, Study Finds"}

Meanwhile, Facebook and Google\u2014which reeled in 68% of spending on U.S. online advertising in the second quarter, according to Pivotal Research\u2014argue that they provide and allow for plenty of measurement, just with some restrictions to protect users\u2019 privacy and to keep pages loading quickly.\n\nIt is common practice in digital campaigns for ad buyers to send publishers what are known as \u201ctags,\u201d which are lines of code that enable them to track the performance of ad campaigns, like how many times an ad is delivered and whether people click on it. In recent years, concerns have risen about whether digital ads can actually be seen on various screens, so ad buyers have also taken to bundling in additional code to track viewability.\n\nHowever, Facebook and YouTube have never allowed agencies to use their own tags or to collect their own viewability data on web video campaigns. Advertisers can send Facebook and YouTube tiny pieces of code that allow for some basic data on impressions (which can\u2019t be used for billing purposes). But for data on viewability, time spent and more sophisticated metrics, buyers have to rely on YouTube\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s custom integrations with third-party partners like Moat and Integral Ad Science, known as IAS.\n\nPhoto: iStock Photo\n\nThere\u2019s the rub. Some ad buyers allege that the way that viewability tracking firms measure data on Facebook and YouTube is fundamentally different from how the process works with the average web publisher. They grumble that, in particular, Facebook\u2014even as it has touted its willingness to work with numerous third-party metrics firms following its recent video overcounting mess\u2014doesn\u2019t always provide straight answers regarding how these integrations work.\n\nAd buyers want to understand who is actually collecting the raw data\u2014the third parties or Facebook itself.\n\n\u201cWe believe objective, third-party measurement is an essential foundation for any mature industry,\u201d said Lyle Schwarz, director of implementation, research and marketplace analysis at the ad buying giant GroupM. \u201cIt is key that qualified vendors such as Moat, DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science or others involved with a publisher be able to measure for themselves, not just evaluate measurement provided by the publisher.\u201d\n\nMost web publishers implement code from companies like Moat or IAS using what\u2019s called a \u201csoftware development kit,\u201d or SDK, which enables these third parties to collect data directly.\n\nFacebook and YouTube do things a bit differently. Instead of allowing third parties to directly pull data from their sites or mobile apps, Facebook and YouTube receive tracking code from the third parties and then modify the code slightly. They also set up a different process to deliver data than is used via typical SDK partnerships.\n\nFacebook and Google say there are good reasons for their approach. (For a primer on how Facebook\u2019s third-party metrics work, click here). Simply copying and pasting code from third parties into their mobile apps could negatively impact the user experience by slowing down the loading of pages, they contend.\n\nMore important, each company is hesitant to let third parties see too much, since both Facebook and Google have reams of consumer data that is vital to their businesses and could set off numerous privacy alarms if exposed. They aren\u2019t alone in their hesitation. Snapchat is also not planning to allow any third-party code directly on its app, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nFor its part, Facebook says that while the process may be different, the net result is that the data received is \u201cidentical to any other integration style,\u201d according to Mark Rabkin, vice president of Facebook\u2019s core ads team. \u201cThe data takes a different train to the same destination.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really, really committed to advertiser value in everything we do,\u201d Mr. Rabkin added. \u201cWe want to make them feel really comfortable.\u201d\n\nBut the different methodology\u2014particularly the involvement of Facebook and YouTube in setting up the data collection process\u2014has left the advertising world with a sense that their third-party tracking isn\u2019t fully third party.\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock.com\n\nThey are \u201cstill not technically being independently third party measured,\u201d said Mitchell Weinstein, senior vice president of ad operations at the media buying firm IPG Mediabrands. Tal Chalozin, co-founder at ad tech company Innovid, agrees, adding that \u201cthe publisher needs to be completely disconnected\u201d for there to be unbiased measurement.\n\nMoat Chief Executive Jonah Goodhart argues that while his company\u2019s work with Facebook and YouTube is unique, it\u2019s still completely objective. He\u2019s adamant that Moat\u2019s data on Facebook and YouTube is solid and just as robust as any other partner, yielding more than 60 different metrics. For example, with Facebook, Moat has two full-time employees focusing on gauging whether its data collection is accurate via an extensive set of testing using a set of Facebook test accounts\u2014without Facebook\u2019s involvement.\n\n\u201cWe are completely confident in the approach we take,\u201d Mr. Goodhart said.\n\nSome in the industry wonder whether this battle is less about the technicalities of measurement and more about fears of Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s increasing hold on the digital ad market.\n\nIt\u2019s potentially in ad buyers\u2019 interests to loudly complain about measurement to gain leverage in negotiations. For instance, many in the ad world were up in arms over Facebook\u2019s recent miscalculation that overestimated for two years the average time users spent watching videos, even though the metric had no impact on billing. (Facebook apologized for the miscalculation.)\n\nFacebook says it goes to great lengths to provide transparency into its practices.\n\n\u201cWe meet weekly with top questions and clients where we have open conversations about these issues,\u201d said Facebook\u2019s Mr. Rabkin. \u201cWe try to do our absolute best.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Ad Measurement Feuds on Facebook, YouTube Hinge on Code"}

For example, through a partnership between Perion and Microsoft, a person who downloads Skype from the Web might be prodded to make Bing their default search engine. More recently, the company has pushed into social and mobile advertising in the U.S. by investing in specialized ad-buying software, and the Undertone acquisition should help Perion ramp up that expansion.\n\n\u201cThis sets the stage for us to enter the more traditional ad tech market,\u201d said Perion Chief Executive Josef Mandelbaum. The market for pushing search traffic through software downloads has gotten tougher in the past few years, he said, as Google has made changes to its search algorithm, making it more difficult to generate consistent revenue. \u201cThis pushes us towards [working with] higher quality publishers and advertisers.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the direction Undertone has been moving as well. The New York-based company was founded in 2001 as an online advertising network that initially focused on selling display and video ads for hundreds of websites. In the past several years, closely held Undertone has worked to refashion its business around larger, \u201chigh impact\u201d digital ads designed for premium advertisers like Mondelez, Land Rover and L\u2019Or\u00e9al, while also pushing into the fast-growing \u201cprogrammatic\u201d ad sector.\n\n\u201cThey have great relationships with agencies and brands, which we do not,\u201d said Mr. Mandelbaum.\n\nUndertone, which has about 275 employees, will continue to operate independently, while the two companies explore potential synergies, said Undertone Chief Executive Corey Ferengul. Together, Perion and Undertone expect to bring in $337 million in net revenue this year, according to the companies.\n\nAccording to Mr. Ferengul, who will remain with the company, Undertone has been profitable for years and had not been searching for a buyer. The company, which generated $89.4 million in non-GAAP net revenues for the first nine months of this year, was first approached by Perion in July, he said.\n\n\u201cIt was out of the blue,\u201d Mr. Ferengul said. \u201cI knew their name casually. I think maybe I had seen their name at a conference somewhere, but I had to look a little bit.\u201d\n\nAfter meeting with Perion, Mr. Ferengul said the two companies saw an opportunity to build out a suite of digital ad products specifically aimed at top advertisers\u2014the ones who typically spend most of their budgets on TV. Undertone delivers high-impact ads on websites run by companies such as Gannett, American Media, AccuWeather and Bonnier Corp.\n\nUndertone pivoted toward proprietary, \u201cbrand-friendly\u201d digital ad units about two years ago, and that now accounts for roughly two-thirds of the company\u2019s revenue.\n\nAccording to Mr. Ferengul, Perion is looking at Undertone and saying \u201cthere is an opportunity for a roll-up, and a role for a scale player that focuses on brand and has a broad offering.\u201d\n\nWhile nothing is imminent, \u201cYou should see more acquisitions [by Perion] in the next few years,\u201d said Mr. Mandelbaum. Meanwhile, the two companies will spend the next year looking for ways to integrate while still maintaining distinct businesses. Perion trades on the Nasdaq and has a market capitalization of about $160 million.\n\n\u201cThis makes us one of the few scalable, profitable ad tech companies,\u201d said Undertone co-founder Eric Franchi. \u201cWe think that puts us in a very unique position.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Israeli Firm Perion Acquires Undertone for $180 Million"}

Do they want to talk to them?\n\nMaybe if Watson\u2014 IBM \u2019s supercomputer perhaps best known for its Jeopardy prowess\u2014was the one talking back?\n\nWeather Co. believes so. The media company, all of which was acquired by IBM last October except for its traditional TV channel, is planning to roll out digital ads that people can communicate with this fall. Using Watson\u2019s artificial intelligence software, advertisers will be able to produce display ads that invite people to ask Watson questions about their products, either by speaking or typing into a search box.\n\nFor example, an allergy medication brand could enable visitors to Weather.com to ask questions about whether the product is appropriate for children or what sort of side effects it might cause. Or a food brand may encourage people to ask about potential recipes.\n\nWeather Co. has already signed on Unilever, Campbell Soup Co. and GSK Healthcare, a unit of GlaxoSmithKline, to start running Watson-powered ads on both desktop and mobile devices this fall. The company isn\u2019t saying yet which individual brands will implement the ads.\n\nInitially, Watson Ads will only be available on Weather Co.\u2019s properties, including Weather.com and Weather Underground. But Jeremy Steinberg, Weather Co.\u2019s global head of sales, said the company is open to having these ads eventually run on other websites and apps\u2014and the technology could even find its way to other media, such as billboards and even TV ads.\n\n\u201cWe believe this capability is going to be completely transformative to the industry,\u201d he said. \u201cCognitive advertising is the new frontier. With Watson Ads, we believe that we are humanizing the ad experience for consumers.\u201d\n\nDigital ads\u2014increasingly dominated by algorithms and automated exchanges\u2014could surely use some humanizing. Mr. Steinberg emphasized that unlike ads tied to keyword searches, Watson ads should pick up on the nuances of natural language, and are meant to respond to more conversational queries like \u201cIs this medication right for my son?\u201d\n\nThis isn't the first time IBM has leveraged Watson for advertising. Earlier this year the company helped Kia find relevant social influencers to promote its Super Bowl ads. And Turner is working with IBM to use Watson to sift through various sources of marketing data in an effort to sell more ads. Despite publicity surrounding the artificial intelligence unit, IBM has yet to break out how much revenue Watson brings in.\n\nThe question is whether people want to interact with online ads, considering consumers\u2019 history of trying to avoid advertising altogether.\n\nCarl Fremont, global chief digital officer at the WPP -owned media agency MEC, said the fact that people will be able to use natural language to communicate with Watson Ads is key, considering how people are gravitating to products like Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the way we interact with multiple devices in an Internet of Things world,\u201d he said.\n\nTheresa Agnew, chief marketing officer for North America at GlaxoSmithKline, which is working with Watson Ads, said that having enough content to feed a campaign with enough questions and answers won\u2019t be an issue.\n\n\u201cBrands today are publishers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are very rich in content. And this is a huge advancement over an old-school banner ad.\u201d\n\nMr. Steinberg acknowledged that the early Watson campaigns will be highly experimental in nature and that it may take time to figure out exactly how the technology will be best used.\n\nWeather Co. and IBM see the benefits of this technology going well beyond just helping brands improve the performance of their ad campaigns. The questions people end up asking Watson ads could be used to guide future messaging and even product development, Mr. Steinberg said.\n\n\u201cWe think this will really help improve all digital advertising, and really all advertising,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I think it can also help brands figure out what their customers really care about.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "People Will Soon Talk to Web Ads on Weather.com, Thanks to Watson"}

That is up significantly from a similar study that was done in 2014, which found only 35% of the advertisers had used programmatic buying.\n\nANA represents many of the country\u2019s largest advertisers such as Procter & Gamble, General Motors and AT&T.\n\nResearch firm eMarketer estimates programmatic ad spending in the U.S. will grow 39.7% this year to $21.55 billion.\n\nAdvertisers are increasing their use of automated buying even though 70% of respondents that did programmatic ads last year were concerned about higher levels of bot fraud in programmatic buys. Bots are computer programs that mimic human web-surfing and artificially boost site traffic.\n\nTheir worries aren\u2019t unfounded. In January, the ANA estimated that marketers wasted about $7 billion last year on online ads that people did not see.\n\nFake Web traffic isn\u2019t the only thing marketers are anxious about, the study showed.\n\nThe majority of advertisers polled also expressed concerns about the lack of transparency in how much an ad actually costs when buying via an automated system and the \u201cdearth of information about whether an agency reaps financial gains from the media seller by using the client\u2019s funds,\u201d the ANA said.\n\nThe ANA is currently trying to bring more visibility to the market and is investigating agency transparency.

About 31% of the companies polled said they have expanded their in-house capabilities to manage and oversee the function.\n\nOther steps they are taking include asking for more detailed campaign reporting from their agency partners and also keeping \u201cblack lists\u201d of sites they try to avoid because they have high levels of ad fraud.\n\nAdvertisers \u201cneed to be asking more questions about programmatic,\u201d said Bill Duggan, group executive vice president at ANA. \u201cIt is still a very opaque\u201d business and within that ecosystem there are place where advertisers lose money, he added.\n\nWrite to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Marketers Flock to Programmatic Ads Despite Concerns About Fraud and Transparency"}
{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-programmatic-tv-is-still-stuck-in-first-gear-1452597919", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Photo: The Wall Street Journal\n\nAbout a year or so ago, there were a slew of announcements in the arena that has loosely been referred to as \u201cprogrammatic TV.\u201d Collectively, they seemed to indicate that the foundation was being laid for TV advertising to finally start operating like digital advertising -- meaning that TV ads would soon be bought and sold using automated technology and precision data.\n\nAmong the many moves, the ad tech company TubeMogul introduced a \u201cprogrammatic TV\u201d software tool and RTL Group invested in the TV ad tech startup Clypd.\n\nMore recently, though, it\u2019s been awfully quiet on the programmatic TV front. At a panel last month hosted by the trade publication Videonuze, the mood was decidedly pessimistic. Obstacles and hurdles were big topics. Buying TV through ad exchanges and software platforms like the Web was hardly even discussed.\n\nThe panelists did agree on the need to kill the phrase \u201cprogrammatic TV,\u201d since it\u2019s not a real thing, they argued.\n\nCMO Today talked to a number of experts and tried to break down what\u2019s what in this nascent sector.\n\nHow big is \u201cprogrammatic TV,\u201d anyhow?\n\nEveryone uses the term in different ways, but the businesses that can be referred to under the programmatic TV banner include TV ad exchanges, TV ad-targeting services and connected TV-related services. International Data Corporation says programmatic TV will come close to being a $1 billion market in the U.S. this year. That\u2019s not so bad, until you consider that TV advertising is a $70 billion market in the U.S., and digital advertising was close to $60 billion last year domestically.\n\nWhat are TV ad exchanges all about?\n\nEssentially, these businesses take TV ad space, pool it together, and sell it via ad tech software, ideally packaged with some targeting data. The challenge here is that the only ad inventory available via these platforms tends to come from local cable companies and satellite TV firms, so it\u2019s not national or primetime in nature. You generally won\u2019t find big broadcast networks here.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of smoke of mirrors out there,\u201d said Long Ellis, president of Longview Media Consulting, which worked on Google\u2019s now defunct TV ad business nearly a decade ago. \u201cNone of the TV networks want to put their inventory into anything that will be commoditized. That scares the hell out of them.\u201d\n\nAmong the ad tech companies that claim to have aggregated TV ad inventory, \u201cnone of them have actually scaled,\u201d said Arun Kumar, Cadreon\u2019s global president. \u201cThey don\u2019t really have type of inventory you are looking for.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s perhaps another reason that this sector is lagging. \u201cThese ad tech companies\u2019 focus was on automating transactions,\u201d said Randy Cooke, vice president of programmatic TV at the ad tech firm SpotX, which RTL Group acquired a majority stake in in 2014. \u201cThat\u2019s not a question that necessarily needed answering.\u201d That\u2019s because, generally speaking, it\u2019s not that hard to buy TV advertising.\n\nNot surprisingly, the companies in the space offer a much different assessment. TubeMogul, which launched a programmatic TV buying platform roughly a year ago, says this sector is now driving 10% of the ad spending flowing through its digital buying software.\n\n\u201cA year ago, this wasn\u2019t a conversation many people in TV business wanted to have, but now they are recognizing this is happening,\u201d said Chief Executive Brett Wilson. \u201cIt\u2019s progressing beyond our wildest expectations.\u201d\n\nThe ad tech startup Clypd, which last year raised $19.4 million in funding, is one of a handful of companies that help advertisers buy TV ads via software. However, the company has gained more traction among \u201cmajor\u201d cable networks looking to cut direct deals with advertisers who are using proprietary data to figure out which shows to advertise in, said Doug Hurd, Clypd\u2019s co-founder and executive vice president of business development. He couldn\u2019t say which networks the company works with.\n\nAren\u2019t networks embracing \u201cdata\u201d in a big way?\n\nWell, yes and no. This is what everybody was talking up last year during the upfronts--the idea advertisers could apply better data insights when buying ads from the big cable and broadcast networks. Instead of just selling you ads in shows that reach women ages 18 to 49, the thinking went, networks can sell you ads in shows that are watched by people who like salad dressing and healthy eating.\n\nThis is happening, but slowly, with some hesitancy on both sides, say experts. The TV networks have a lucrative business model they don\u2019t want to wreck, and are wary of letting advertisers cherry pick ads in specific shows, while ignoring the rest, said Mike Dean, vice president of programmatic and data-driven sales at ABC.\n\nFrom the buy side, \u201cI\u2019ve often heard the skeptical comment that this is the networks trying to offload remnant ads, selling me very local, late-night, otherwise low quality [shows],\u201d said Christina Beaumier, senior vice president at Xaxis Media.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Dean, said these type of deals often involve more people, more complexity, and more costs to middlemen--to the point that they are often not worth it. So there\u2019s not a ton of activity. Rather, most of what you are seeing now in this sector is TV companies putting out \u201cpress releases for the upfront,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat about the whole thing about different households seeing different ads?\n\nThis tactic, \u201caddressable TV,\u201d has some characteristics of the precision of digital advertising. Using set-top box data from cable companies such as Cablevision and Cox, advertisers can deliver ads only to households that are likely to be in the market for a car, or may be likely to vote for a particular political candidate. After many years of moving slowly, ad buyers say addressable TV is taking off.\n\nJonathan Bokor, senior vice president and director of advanced media at MediaVest, says this will soon be a $1 billion market on its own. \u201cAddressable has a nice run ahead of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe auto category has really adopted this.\u201d\n\nHowever, the approach has its limits. For one, It can be quite manual to implement, Ms. Beaumier of Xaxis said. And since it\u2019s only really available through select cable systems, it only really makes sense when your target audience is less than 30% of the U.S., she said. Otherwise, it\u2019s more efficient to buy TV ads nationally.\n\nWhat about apps and streaming-media viewing?\n\nThis subcategory has ad buyers excited, but it\u2019s still tiny. Generally, \u201cconnected TV\u2019 refers to advertising delivered to TV apps--sometimes that includes ads within full episodes of shows, while in other cases these are ads delivered within the digital menus of various individual apps. Since this content is delivered through the Internet, the potential to deliver more Web-like \u201cdynamic advertising\u201d is large.\n\nProblem is, so many of us spend our streaming time with services like Netflix and Amazon, which don\u2019t carry ads. \u201cConnected TV is more like digital advertising but doesn\u2019t have the scale,\u201d said Sorosh Tavakoli, senior vice president of ad tech at Ooyala, which helps TV companies manage video advertising.\n\nStill, platforms like Crackle, Roku and Hulu are all on buyers\u2019 radar, said Ms. Beaumier.\u201c The market is accelerating and selling out.\u201d\n\nSo, are things just stuck?\n\nWhen asked if programmatic TV has been quiet, Mr. Dean said, \u201cabsolutely. This requires an evolution of business model between [pay TV providers] and programmers and changes between sellers and buyers.\u201d\n\nMr. Bokor concurred. \u201cIt\u2019s just not simple,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are groups with competing interests. You have the [pay TV providers.] You have networks who are trying to offer their own solutions. And you have buyers who aren\u2019t\u2019 necessarily aligned with the way that networks want to do things.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Why Programmatic TV is Still Stuck in First Gear"}

The company said it was introducing a new metric to fix the problem.\n\nSome ad agency executives who were also informed by Facebook about the change started digging deeper, prompting Facebook to give them a more detailed account, one of the people familiar with the situation said.\n\nAd buying agency Publicis Media was told by Facebook that the earlier counting method likely overestimated average time spent watching videos by between 60% and 80%, according to a late August letter Publicis Media sent to clients that was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nA spokeswoman for Publicis Media, a division of Publicis Groupe SA, referred calls to Facebook. Publicis was responsible for purchasing roughly $77 billion in ads on behalf of marketers around the world in 2015, according to estimates from research firm Recma.\n\nGroupM, the ad buying unit of WPP PLC, also was notified of the discrepancy by Facebook, another person familiar with the matter said.\n\nOn Friday, Facebook apologized. \u201cThe metric should have reflected the total time spent watching a video divided by the total number of people who played the video. But it didn\u2019t,\u201d said David Fischer, vice president of business and marketing partnerships, in a Facebook post. \u201cWhile this is only one of the many metrics marketers look at, we take any mistake seriously.\u201d\n\nFacebook had said in an earlier statement: \u201cWe recently discovered an error in the way we calculate one of our video metrics.\u201d It added: \u201cThis error has been fixed, it did not impact billing, and we have notified our partners both through our product dashboards and via sales and publisher outreach. We also renamed the metric to make it clearer what we measure. This metric is one of many our partners use to assess their video campaigns.\u201d\n\nThe news is an embarrassment for Facebook, which has been touting the rapid growth of video consumption across its platform in recent years.\n\nDue to the miscalculated data, marketers may have misjudged the performance of video advertising they have purchased from Facebook over the past two years. It also may have impacted their decisions about how much to spend on Facebook video versus other video ad sellers such as Google\u2019s YouTube, Twitter, and even TV networks.\n\nMedia companies and publishers are affected, too, since they\u2019ve been given inaccurate data about the consumption of their video content across the social network. Many use that information to help determine the types of content they post.\n\nFor the past two years Facebook only counted video views of more than three seconds when calculating its \u201cAverage Duration of Video Viewed\u201d metric. Video views of under three seconds were not factored in, thereby inflating the average. Facebook\u2019s new metric, \u201cAverage Watch Time,\u201d will reflect video views of any duration. That will replace the earlier metric.\n\nIn its note to clients, Publicis said the change was an attempt to obfuscate Facebook\u2019s earlier miscalculations.\n\n\u201cIn an effort to distance themselves from the incorrect metrics, Facebook is deprecating [the old metrics] and introducing \u2018new\u2019 metrics in September. Essentially, they\u2019re coming up with new names for what they were meant to measure in the first place,\u201d the memo said.\n\nThe miscounting could also fuel concerns among advertisers and media companies about the so-called \u201cwalled gardens\u201d that companies including Facebook and Google are often described as operating. Both companies keep a tight grip on data, and only allow limited third-party tracking firms to plug into their systems.\n\nKeith Weed, chief marketing officer of Unilever, said in an interview last year, tech companies that don\u2019t let third parties measure their platforms is equivalent to \u201cletting them mark their own homework.\u201d\n\nThe Publicis note said, \u201cThis once again illuminates the absolute need to have 3rd party tagging and verification on Facebook\u2019s platform. Two years of reporting inflated performance numbers is unacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u2014Shalini Ramachandran contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com and Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Facebook Overestimated Key Video Metric for Two Years"}

Photo: Associated Press\n\nInvestors have been fretting about Viacom Inc. \u2019s cable TV fortunes and hoping the company will cook up new ways to profit in the digital economy. On Tuesday, as the media company reports quarterly results, it will have a new partnership to tout on that front.\n\nThe shiny new object: a deal with Snapchat Inc., the popular vanishing messages app that already carries content for Viacom-owned networks Comedy Central and MTV. Viacom and Snapchat are taking their deal a step further with a multiyear agreement that allows the media company to sell advertising on Snapchat\u2019s behalf.\n\nFor Snapchat, the move could help lure in more big advertisers to the millennial-focused platform. Viacom gets a chance to flex its ad sales muscles and direct some attention away from soft TV ratings, a sagging share price and drama related to the declining health of its 92-year-old controlling shareholder, Sumner Redstone.\n\nWith the MTV generation now in adulthood, Viacom is keen for any way to connect with the young viewers it has specialized in reaching.\n\nUnder the deal, Viacom will have exclusive third-party rights to directly sell advertising surrounding Snapchat\u2019s owned and operated content. That includes pop-up \u201cLive Stories\u201d that cull together posts from users in specific geographic locations or during a holiday.\n\nViacom will also add two new channels to Snapchat\u2019s \u201cDiscover\u201d page, where media outlets such as CNN, Vox, Mashable and The Wall Street Journal also have channels. MTV, which currently operates an international channel, will now get a U.S. version. Comedy Central, which produces a U.S. channel, will expand internationally. The company said it would further invest in making programming geared toward Snapchat.\n\n\u201cWe had early on made a big commitment to developing premium, original content for the channels we had on the platform,\u201d said Viacom Chief Financial Officer Wade Davis. \u201cBased on the success we had, we started talking about what we could do beyond that.\u201d\n\nViacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman, who succeeded Mr. Redstone as executive chairman last week, will discuss the Snapchat deal during the earnings call Tuesday, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nMr. Dauman has taken an unusually granular interest in Snapchat, leading the company\u2019s efforts to work with the upstart messaging app. Last fall, Mr. Dauman said he met with the app\u2019s CEO Evan Spiegel at the bar at Toscana Restaurant in Los Angeles. He got so involved in the creation of Comedy Central\u2019s icon on Snapchat that he weighed in on its color, suggesting it visually pop on the Discover page. It is the only green one.\n\nSnapchat CEO Evan Spiegel. Photo: Getty Images\n\nThe agreement comes as Snapchat tries to grow its revenue and expand its fledgling advertising business. Ad buyers say that while the app offers the potential to reach coveted young consumers, many marketers are hanging on the sidelines due to Snapchat\u2019s expensive prices and lack of ad sales organization.\n\n\u201cSince launching ads just over a year ago, Snapchat has continuously worked to strengthen its advertising team and product offerings, most recently restructuring the team,\u201d a Snapchat spokeswoman said.\n\nAn accord between Snapchat and Viacom may feel like a teenager letting his middle-aged dad tag along to the party because there is a better chance of scoring some booze. Viacom has long held relationships with the large ad buyers and brands that plunk down major dollars. Snapchat, though it boasts 7 billion video views a day, is a relative advertising newbie.\n\nMarketers like General Electric Co. , Coca-Cola Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. have advertised on the platform. In May, Snapchat raised more than $500 million in funding, valuing the startup at $16 billion.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of TV buyers that want to buy Snapchat more and more,\u201d said Imran Khan, chief strategy officer of Snapchat. Mr. Khan said that the company will continue to sell \u201cbasically most of our inventory,\u201d but that the Viacom deal \u201creduces friction\u201d and lets big brands buy Snapchat ads as part of a larger TV package. Snapchat has a revenue-sharing agreement with Viacom for the ads it sells.\n\nJeff Lucas, Viacom\u2019s ad sales chief, said that both companies are targeting the same young viewers and are a \u201cnatural match.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe identified early on the similarities in our audience with Snapchat as they were starting out. They realized early on about our access to the ad market in terms of selling against millennials,\u201d said Mr. Lucas, who advises Snapchat on advertising matters.\n\nAs the television industry struggles with falling ratings, Viacom has hawked a new data-focused product to better target viewers across its shows. Viacom\u2019s custom content hub \u201cVelocity\u201d has also fashioned ways to integrate brands into television programs.\n\nThe Snapchat deal allows Viacom to sell advertising on Discover for its own content and for that owned by Snapchat. Last year Snapchat abandoned its dedicated Snap Channel, but still posts its own content to Discover. Last month it debuted a new political campaign show called \u201cGood Luck America.\u201d Viacom wouldn't sell ads on the Discover pages of other media companies, Snapchat said.\n\n\u2014Keach Hagey contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Viacom to Sell Snapchat Ads in Multiyear Deal"}

While revenue surges, the site will probably break even this year after turning a profit in 2015, he said.\n\n\u201cWe expect to generate a profit next year. We like our current trajectory,\u201d he said.\n\nThe site\u2019s success comes despite a rocky start. When Mr. Goldberg, a co-founder of the sports blog, the Bleacher Report, announced in 2013 that he was starting a female-oriented site, he became a lightning rod for critics who accused him of having no clue what women want or need.\n\nBut the traffic seems to have proved those critics wrong. The site, which features stories like \u201cThe One Place You Should Never Get a Piercing\u201d and \u201cWhy I\u2019d Never Date a Trump Supporter\u201d had 28.6 million unique visitors in the U.S. in September, according to comScore Inc. Plus, its recently created sister-site, Romper, which is aimed at millennial moms, drew an additional 6 million visitors.\n\nThat puts it on par with well-established players in the space, like PopSugar, which had 37.9 million unique visitors that month, and Refinery29, which attracted 28.4 million.\n\nBustle has also found a receptive audience with advertisers, doing campaigns with brands such as Adidas, Smartwater, H&M and Del Monte, among others.\n\nIn March, Bustle raised $11.5 million in a funding round led by Saban Capital Group, Haim Saban\u2019s private-equity firm that\u2019s among the owners of Univision Communications Inc. In total, the company has raised $38.5 million.\n\nWith the most recent investment, the company increased from 100 to 170 employees, with investments in sales and technology.\n\nMr. Goldberg said a lot of what has driven the site has been about trying to be in the right place amid a major shift in the economics of the media industry, particularly in print publishing. Bustle has positioned itself to capture the marketing dollars specifically moving out of print, as opposed to TV like many other digital competitors that have invested more heavily in video.\n\n\u201cSo many ad dollars have been tied up in decades-old relationships with print publications which can no longer deliver the kind of value they could years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that money shift substantially now and that has resulted in a big increase in the size of our average deal.\u201d\n\nThat shift has been accelerating across the publishing industry. According to GroupM, global digital ad spending is expected to grow by 14% this year, while global magazine ad spending is expected to fall 2.9%. For newspapers, the decline is expected to be 8.7%, the biggest drop since 2009.\n\nMr. Goldberg said the company wasn't seeking further funding at the moment, but he wanted to make public the company\u2019s performance because \u201cthere should be more transparency in this business.\u201d\n\nWrite to Lukas I.

It generated 19.5 million views in April, and expects to generate 26 million views in May. According to David Grant, president of PopSugar Studios, viewership of PopSugar\u2019s made-for-Snapchat videos have been expanding their views at an average of 101% a month.\n\nNow the company plans to weave advertisers into this content, which consists of daily collections of videos and photos like step-by-step instructions for how to make a frozen banana dessert or turn old jeans into shorts.\n\n\u201cWe fully intend to make money from this,\u201d said Mr. Grant.\n\nPopSugar can\u2019t just run standard video ads in between content in a given collection. The company has to rely on branded content that weaves a marketers\u2019 message or product into its stories.\n\nYet Snapchat is not necessarily wild about publishers or marketers posting brand-funded content to the app, said people familiar with the matter. As of now, Snapchat doesn\u2019t plan to complain about any such deals, but they may technically violate the company\u2019s terms of service.\n\nAccording to those terms, Snapchat users are not allowed to post content \u201cfor any commercial purposes without our consent\u201d or that \u201cspams or solicits Snapchat\u2019s users.\u201d\n\nPlenty of so-called influencers with big followings on Snapchat weave messages from paying marketers into their posts, so it\u2019s clearly a gray area\u2014and one that has bubbled up on other big social platforms.\n\nFor example, YouTube has long encouraged its creators to pursue deals with brands where they would get paid to integrate a marketing message or product. Meanwhile, Facebook \u2019s policy regarding branded content has gone back and forth over time. In one instance, the social network recently tweaked its rules, forcing Mic.com to stop running banner-type ads within its videos.\n\nPopSugar is building a following on Snapchat with posts like this, despite not being a Discovery partner in the app. Photo: Snapchat\n\nThat uneven climate is not stopping other publishers from trying to make money off of Snapchat audiences down the road. For example, Thrillist\u2014which, like PopSugar, is not part of Discover\u2014just put together a six-person Snapchat team, reported Digiday. Similarly, Mic is regularly posting to its non-Discover Snapchat account, and the company says viewership numbers have nearly doubled since January.\n\nLike PopSugar, Food52 has committed to regularly churning out Discover-like content on Snapchat, and has even sold ads in this content as part or larger ad packages, said co-founder Amanda Hesser, such as a campaign for the tomato brand Muir Glen that included Snapchat videos on making a Bloody Mary. Food52 says it takes steps to make sure it\u2019s clear to users that these videos have been paid for by an advertiser.\n\nBuilding up a Snapchat audience when a publisher isn\u2019t part of Discover isn\u2019t necessarily easy. For PopSugar, the move has meant dealing with fewer resources but has also entailed fewer costs than being a Discover partner.\n\n\u201cWe had a conversation about trying to join Discover,\u201d Mr. Grant said. But he said he knew such a move could be both time consuming and potentially costly, since Discover partners are required to share revenue with Snapchat. Some also pay the company a minimum monthly fee to be part of Discover, The Information has reported.\n\n\u201cWe said, \u2018Are we really ready to dedicate the resources or not?\u2019\u201d recalled Mr. Grant. \u201c\u2018Why don\u2019t we try to act like we are on Discover on our own channel?\u2019\u201d\n\nStill, not getting the Discover treatment has serious drawbacks. For one, Snapchat Discover partners work directly with Snapchat on their channels. They can pre-schedule content. They have exclusive access to data and analytics. And they have more room to incorporate text annotations in their content and can distribute, longer, professionally produced videos, as well as animation.\n\n\u201cEven in this hacky way, we\u2019ve been able to create really compelling content within those limitations,\u201d Mr. Grant said. Next on the list is figure out if advertisers agree, as long as Snapchat doesn\u2019t eventually object.\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "PopSugar\u2019s Snapchat Audience Is Growing, But Ad Revenue Is An Open Question"}

AwesomenessTV, which caters to teens and tweens, has even run one of the first ads on the platform.\n\nThe stars of Comedy Central's \u201cBroad City\u201d appearing in an Instagram Story. Photo: Instagram\n\nInstagram, the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook, has acknowledged the new function owes a great deal of inspiration to Snapchat. In fact Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom noted that Snapchat \u201cpioneered\u201d the stories format in an interview with the Wall Street Journal last month.\n\nInstagram Stories, like Snapchat Stories, typically consist of a handful of images and videos\u2014often annotated and decorated with graphics and emoticons\u2014stitched together in a single package. Both are generally shot with a person\u2019s phone and disappear after 24 hours.\n\nBut they differ from the more professionally produced Snapchat Discover, which allows a limited list of approved media partners to post scheduled, pre-produced collections of content that often features unique Snapchat-esque animation.\n\nSince Instagram Stories launched Aug. 2, Time Inc. has been aggressively testing it, particularly with coverage of the Rio Olympics. For example, its brand Sports Illustrated has been posting images from various Olympic venues to Instagram Stories. Entertainment Weekly is planning to use the format on Friday to reveal this week\u2019s cover featuring \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d star Eddie Redmayne. Earlier this week, People produced an Instagram Story from Rio with members of NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show, including Hoda Kotb, that generated over 100,000 views, according to a Time Inc. spokeswoman.\n\nAn image from a recent Instagram Story for People Photo: Instagram\n\nPublishers say that overall the new content is very experimental, but the possibilities are intriguing. For example, Tastemade, which already has 2.1 million followers on Instagram, produced a \u201cBreakfast Around the World\u201d Instagram Story via which staffers from the company\u2019s offices in Brazil, Argentina, the U.K., Japan and the U.S. shot small video segments with local digital influencers highlighting a local breakfast cuisine.\n\n\u201cYou can do an orchestrated story, with a definite start and finish,\u201d explained Oren Katzeff, head of programming at Tastemade. \u201cThat is different than an individual piece of content in a feed.\u201d\n\nInstagram Stories are designed for less-polished and less-perfected content, which is also an appeal for publishers. Users don\u2019t even have an option to like the posts, removing some of the pressure.\n\n\u201cWhat we like so far is that Instagram Stories gives us the ability to showcase content that might not have made it into our highly curated feed before,\u201d said Amy Odell, editor of Cosmopolitan.com. For example, she said, \u201cinstead of just one perfectly edited image of an ice cream sundae, we posted several Stories from a recent ice cream social held at Cosmopolitan.com headquarters.\u201d\n\nCosmopolitan is one of several Hearst brands experimenting with Instagram Stories. Travel + Leisure recently created a \u201cfros\u00e9 tasting\u201d Story which generated 106,000 views.\n\nThe fact that Instagram is showcasing Stories along the top of a user\u2019s feed at the moment is helping to drive early consumption, publishers say. Mashable\u2019s first Instagram Story generated approximately 30,000 unique viewers, more than double what the site sees on an average video posted to Instagram, said a spokesman. Similarly, Food Network says that its Stories have regularly exceeded 100,000 views and that the audience is being accumulated much faster than the network\u2019s average Instagram post.\n\nInstagram's new Stories feature Photo: Instagram\n\nInstagram Stories are different from Snapchat Discover in many ways, including that Discover partners\u2014which are top media companies\u2014are featured on a dedicated portion of the app. Photo: Snapchat\n\nPublishers say that Instagram has provided solid access to data and measurement early on. But unlike the average Instagram post, Instagram Stories aren\u2019t necessarily designed to be shared\u2014whereas Snapchat Discover content can be shared within Snapchat.\n\n\u201cThe content is supposed to be more transient, things that you may not want to save forever,\u201d said Peer Schneider, general manager of IGN, a site for gaming enthusiasts.\n\nOf course, comparing Instagram Stories with Snapchat Discover is a bit apple and oranges. Both apps claim huge daily audiences: Snapchat reaches 150 million people a day, while Instagram says it reaches 300 million daily users. Snapchat Discover, however, provides a unique, stand-alone section of its app specifically to showcase media partners\u2019 content, and Snapchat delivers ads into Discover content that either Snapchat or the partners can sell.\n\nRight now, Instagram doesn't offer a formal ad product for Stories, though the company says that is in the works. Instagram hasn\u2019t really put in place limitations for publishers when it comes to branded entertainment, allowing AwesomenessTV to publish a series of videos and images produced on behalf of Old Navy\u2014a campaign titled \u201cBest Day Ever.\u201d\n\nAwesomenessTV ran an ad for Old Navy on its Instagram account. Photo: Instagram\n\n\u201cEvery day we\u2019re engaging Gen Z on the platforms they care about, and Instagram Stories was a game changer,\u201d said Paul Kelly, AwesomenessTV\u2019s chief partnerships officer. \u201cTo Old Navy\u2019s credit, they were totally up for experimenting with us.

Photo: Justin Tallis/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nFacebook \u2019s ad-measurement odyssey continues. The social-media giant has revealed two new adjustments to the data it provides marketers to evaluate the effectiveness of their ads.\n\nIn September, The Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook had been overestimating a video-advertising metric for as long as two years in some cases. Then last month, the company revealed it had found four more measurement discrepancies after undertaking an extensive audit of all of its advertising-related data.\n\nThat announcement seemed to put Facebook\u2019s ad-measurement challenges to bed. But on Friday, Facebook said it had uncovered two more discrepancies and was working to make specific changes to its ad-data output.\n\nSpecifically, Facebook explained in a blog post that during live video streams, it was in some cases counting individual users\u2019 reactions to posts (such as likes and other responses) as part of another related metric, i.e. the number of reactions that these live streams generated when shared on Facebook. Facebook said it is reallocating these metrics.\n\nIn addition, Facebook said it uncovered a discrepancy in how metrics such as likes and shares are counted via its mobile app, and the company is in the process of resolving the issue.\n\nBeyond the two new discrepancies, Facebook also said it has changed the methodology it uses to help advertisers estimate how many people will potentially see ads on Facebook. The new methodology relies less on projecting data using smaller samples of Facebook audience. This change should decrease or increase Facebook\u2019s ad-reach estimates by less than 10% the company said in the blog post.\n\nNews of these new discrepancies was first reported by Marketingland.com.\n\nIndividually, none of these metrics should affect Facebook\u2019s billing, since marketers typically sign ad contracts that guarantee a certain delivery of broader metrics, such as the total number of times an ad is shown to consumers over a set period. Still, the fact that this issue keeps arising will likely irk ad buyers, some of whom have publicly been calling for Facebook to rely less on its own internal ad data and work with more third-party ad-measurement firms when negotiating deals.\n\nIan Schafer, founder and chairman at ad agency Deep Focus, credited Facebook for being communicative regarding these issues, and recognized the complexity of providing so much data for a slew of new products like Facebook Live.\n\nThat said, Facebook\u2019s growing dominance in digital advertising\u2014and its perceived technological expertise means most marketers will hold Facebook to a higher standard. \u201cThe are trying to get it right,\u201d he said. \u201cYet they are a data business, with a huge responsibility.

The ANA did not feel comfortable endorsing the guidelines before the conclusion of its formal investigation into agency transparency issues, he added.\n\n\u201cThere are elements within the principles we feel need to be stronger that protect the interests of the ANA members,\u201d Mr. Liodice said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough information to be able to ensure the principles work equally for the agencies as well as the marketers. We want to wait until we have all the facts so that we can support the principles.\u201d\n\nThe ANA in October hired two companies -- K2 Intelligence and Ebiquity/FirmDecision-- to conduct an investigation into agency transparency issues, including rebate allegations. The investigation is expected to conclude by the spring, Mr. Liodice said. The 4As is not involved with that investigation.\n\nThe relationship between marketers and their agencies have become increasingly strained amidst client concerns that their agencies may have arrangements in place with media sellers that reward the agencies for spending more. If an agency chooses to direct more of their clients\u2019 budgets to specific vendors, it may receive lower ad rates, free ad space or even cash, for example.\n\nThe issue of transparency came into the limelight last March after former Mediacom CEO Jon Mandel made claims at an ANA conference that media rebates are widespread in the advertising industry. Many Madison Avenue executives and agencies have distanced themselves from those claims and said rebates, or kickbacks, are not a part of the media buying practice in the U.S.\n\nThe 4As\u2019 \u201cTransparency Guiding Principles of Conduct\u201d lays out nine principles that aim to improve the trust between agencies and their clients in an increasingly complex media planning and buying landscape in the U.S. The key takeaway for clients and agencies is to \u201cbe as transparent with each other as you can be,\u201d Ms. Hill said, adding that the organization\u2019s agencies felt like they were adhering to these guidelines already.\n\nThe guidelines are meant to evolve over the time and the 4As\u2019 task force will update the principles as needed, the organization said. The principles cover client-agency relationships for U.S. media planning and buying, separate commercial relationships between agencies and media vendors and other suppliers, and client-agency governance.\n\nThe guidelines call for \u201cfull disclosure and full transparency in media planning and buying, unless there is an exception that the client has agreed to in advance and is covered by a separate agreement.\u201d If an agency enters into commercial relationships with media vendors and other suppliers on its own account, it should disclose \u201cthe general type of commercial relationships and explain the controls and procedures it has in place to ensure that these relationships are on an arm\u2019s-length basis.\u201d\n\nThe guidelines also state that \u201cthe agency business is governed by contracts with clients\u201d and \u201call terms of business between the agency and the client should be documented in a formal written agreement\u201d that both parties should comply with.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on both clients and agencies to communicate key terms of the contract to those individuals in their respective organizations who will be working on the business and be affected by the contract,\u201d the principles state. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that there is a deep understanding of the business model by both clients and agencies and the terms of the contract, particularly for opt-in services. As media becomes more complicated, so do the business models and contract arrangements.\u201d\n\nWrite to Nathalie Tadena at nathalie.tadena@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Advertising Trade Groups Split Over Transparency Guidelines"}

WSJ\u2019s Sarah Rabil joins Lunch Break with Tanya Rivero and explains how the miscalculation happened and the financial impact on both Facebook and its advertisers. Photo: AP\n\nFacebook Inc. on Friday apologized for overestimating a key video metric for two years, a miscalculation that irked advertisers and media companies that have poured resources into video efforts on the social network.\n\nIn a Facebook post, David Fischer, vice president of business and marketing partnerships, described in greater detail how the company discovered about a month ago the error in calculating the average time users spent watching videos.\n\n\u201cThe metric should have reflected the total time spent watching a video divided by the total number of people who played the video. But it didn\u2019t \u2013 it reflected the total time spent watching a video divided by only the number of \u2018views\u2019 of a video (that is, when the video was watched for three or more seconds),\u201d Mr. Fischer wrote. \u201cAnd so the miscalculation overstated this metric. While this is only one of the many metrics marketers look at, we take any mistake seriously.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that ad buying agency Publicis Media was told by Facebook that the earlier method likely overstated the metric by between 60% and 80%. That discrepancy means that marketers could have misconstrued the performance of video ads, affecting their decision making when it comes to spending money on Facebook versus competitors like YouTube, Twitter or even television.\n\n\u201cWe want our clients to know that this miscalculation has not and will not going forward have an impact on billing or how media mix models value their Facebook video investments,\u201d Mr. Fischer wrote.\n\nMr. Fischer said that Facebook noticed the discrepancy about a month ago, fixed it and notified its partners. He also said that the miscounting did not impact other figures, like number of video views. \u201cWe sincerely apologize for the issues this has created for our clients,\u201d Mr. Fischer wrote.\n\nFacebook stock was down 1.7% on Friday morning.\n\nThe error has stoked fears, long percolating in the media industry, about the \u201cwalled gardens\u201d that publishers and advertisers believe tech giants like Facebook and Google operate. Facebook allows only limited access to third-party measurement specialists to plug into their systems.\n\n\u201cWe know we can\u2019t have true partnerships with our clients unless we are upfront and honest with them, including when we make mistakes like this one. Our clients\u2019 trust and belief in our metrics is essential to us and we have to earn that trust,\u201d Mr. Fischer wrote.\n\n\u201cThat is why we also give marketers choice by offering third-party video verification options with companies like Nielsen and Moat. We want marketers to measure video with us in the way they feel most comfortable,\u201d he wrote.\n\nA letter Publicis Media sent to clients, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, said the metric issue \u201conce again illuminates the absolute need to have 3rd party tagging and verification on Facebook\u2019s platform. Two years of reporting inflated performance numbers is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Facebook Apologizes for Video Metric Miscalculation"}

The advertiser trade group said Tuesday it has hired two companies -- K2 Intelligence and Ebiquity/FirmDecisions -- to conduct the investigation.\n\nThe probe is designed to \u201cdemystify\u201d the ad-buying landscape, the ANA said, and to provide its members with perspective on \u201cnon-transparent behavior\u201d including rebates, barter arrangements, arbitrage and other agency practices and processes. A total of 26 firms were considered for the role.\n\n\u201cI am very pleased that both K2 Intelligence and Ebiquity/FirmDecisions have agreed to provide leadership for this important industry initiative,\u201d said ANA president and CEO, Bob Liodice in a statement. \u201cEach brings a unique perspective and a set of powerful skills and resources. We believe those assets are highly complementary and will lead us to the objective \u2014 independent insights that our industry requires.\u201d\n\nK2 Intelligence was founded in 2009 by Jeremy Kroll and Jules Kroll, who previously founded corporate investigation and risk consulting firm Kroll Inc. K2 Intelligence recently hired Milan Patel, former chief technology officer at the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s cyber division, as a managing director.\n\nEbiquity/FirmDecisions is a marketing optimization and media auditing specialist.\n\nThe relationship between marketers and their media agencies has become increasingly strained in recent years, as rumors of agency rebates have swirled around the industry. Marketers worry that some agencies have agreements in place with media sellers that reward them for spending more. If the agency chooses to direct more of their clients\u2019 budgets to specific vendors, the agency may receive lower ad rates, free ad space or even cash, for example.\n\nIn April, Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser downgraded his ratings on the four major ad holding companies \u2014 WPP, Omnicom, Publicis and Interpublic \u2014 noting that the allegations about \u201ckickbacks\u201d in the U.S. are difficult to ignore.\n\nLast year the ANA and Forrester Research conducted a survey of about 150 senior marketers and found 46% of those polled expressed concern about the transparency of their media buys. Survey results also showed that more than half of those polled noted a high level of concern over the possibility that agencies may receive a rebate from the media seller.\n\nFormer Mediacom Chief Executive Jon Mandel fueled concerns further in March when he told a room full of marketers at a conference of the Association of National Advertisers that agency rebates are now widespread across the industry.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that the holding companies are so large, interconnected and incestuous that it\u2019s very easy to have very little transparency in that world,\u201d former marketing chief of Coca-Cola, Joe Tripodi said at the time. \u201cAs much as they say they are transparent they are able to move stuff around and hide stuff. It\u2019s difficult to get a clear line of sight into the accountability at the holding companies,\u201d he added.\n\nIt\u2019s those types of concerns the ANA hopes its investigation will address. Mr. Liodice also said the ANA looks forward to \u201csharing K2\u2019s findings with our colleagues at the American Association of Advertising Agencies (4A\u2019s).\u201d\n\nEarlier this year the ANA and the 4A\u2019s created what they called the Joint Media Transparency Taskforce, which the groups said was designed to establish best practices in transparency.\n\nIn June, a Task Force working group was established to develop a set of key transparency principles, the groups announced, which are due to be issued in a matter of weeks.\n\nWrite to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Advertiser Group ANA Will Investigate Agency Rebate Allegations"}

And it says it has the data to prove those laser-targeted TV ads are driving sales.\n\nSpecifically, over the past year-plus, Volvo and its media buying partners, Mindshare and the advanced TV ad specialist group Modi Media, have been running TV ads specifically aimed at about 12 million households. These households have members that are likely to be buying cars in the next few months, based on data from companies like Experian and Acxiom, as well as registration data from the Department of Motor Vehicles, Volvo and its agencies say.\n\nBesides employing this digital-style targeting, Volvo and its partners say they\u2019ve been able to track whether the specific households that get exposed to these ads go out and actually buy cars.\n\nThe carmaker won\u2019t say how many cars it has sold as the result of this tactic but, throughout this effort, Volvo and its partners have run test and control groups to gauge the effectiveness of the targeted ads. According to Bodil Eriksson, executive vice president, marketing, brand & communications at Volvo Cars North America, the addressable TV efforts have demonstrated a 22% lift in sales in the markets the campaign is running.\n\nThus, as this campaign has progressed, Volvo has pumped more money into addressable TV and taken ad budgets from national TV. The brand now expects to spend \u201cseveral million dollars\u201d on addressable TV--the industry term for delivering TV ads to specific American households based on their demographics and shopping preferences--this year, or about half of its TV ad budget, Ms. Eriksson said.\n\n\u201cYou always have this constant argument at a company like ours, \u2018does marketing work or not?\u2019 and it\u2019s really tiring,\u201d she said. \u201cThis [tactic] works so well for us. So we\u2019ve taken down our TV spending a lot as it\u2019s gotten too expensive for us.\u201d\n\nInstead, Volvo is funneling more ad budgets to the four pay-TV providers--Cablevision, Dish Network, AT&T and Comcast Corp.--that are able to provide the level of targeting and precision it needs. The brand is now able to reach prospective consumers in markets covering roughly half of the country, said Tobias Wolf, managing director, client leadership at Mindshare.\n\nOf course, for years, marketers have dreamed of being able to deliver ads to TV consumers with the same targeting precision they can with online advertising, but to date those efforts have been limited in scope. And while a future in which everybody gets the right ad at the right time is still probably a ways away, Volvo\u2019s recent efforts in addressable TV could provide a window onto how TV advertising might evolve in the near term, particularly during a time that the business is under fire from the growth of ad skipping and ad-free binge watching.\n\nTo be sure, Volvo\u2019s media shift hardly represents a sea change in media buying. The advertiser spent $66.5 million in media last year, according to Kantar Media, not much considering that auto brands collectively shelled out $11 billion in media. And by Ms. Eriksson\u2019s admission, Volvo\u2019s media budget pales compared to other car giants. \u201cWe are so small,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a .3% market share. So even if we double sales we would still be really tiny. We\u2019re never going to be able to outspend everybody. So we have to think differently, and have to really understand who is likely to like what we do and embrace. The beauty today is we actually have technology that will support this.\u201d\n\nTo get this level of targeting, Modi Media uses data from Experian, which has collected information on 700 million registered cars in the U.S. Experian has identified a segment of consumers who were 15 times more likely to be in the market for a new car based on factors such as the timing of their last lease and the kind of cars they\u2019ve purchased in the past, according to Mike Bologna, president Modi Media.\n\nThen, they matched that data up with car registration data from the Department of Motor Vehicles to find people that have purchased or leased luxury cars and--based on historical car shopping patterns--may be soon due to buy or lease a new one.\n\nThen, that list of consumers is anonymously matched up with subscriber data from the four different pay-TV companies. These TV companies are then able to deliver ads to those households\u2014while other households receive different ads.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018we think they are watching this,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Wolf. \u201cIt\u2019s, \u2018we know they are watching this.\u2019\u201d\n\nOr as Mr. Bologna put it, the set-top boxes only serves an ad when those households are watching TV, so there\u2019s little chance of ad skipping or other waste, said Mr. Bologna. \u201cIt\u2019s like online advertising.\u201d\n\nOnly unlike online advertising, there are no cookies tracking people on their computers to see if they end up making purchases after clicking on ads. Instead, Modi and Mindshare turn again to partners like Experian to piece together how many people saw the ads and then purchased new cars during the campaign. They say so far the efforts have delivered a return in sales that is five times larger than what Volvo spent on media.\n\nThat\u2019s what has Volvo and its partners bullish on addressable TV\u2019s potential to move out of the testing stage.\n\n\u201cThis stuff is real, and now it\u2019s scalable,\u201d said Mr. Wolf. \u201cAnd we can figure out how many cars we sold on the back end.\u201d\n\nSo does that mean that Volvo is about to lead a revolution in precision TV advertising? Well, the recent blitz from fantasy sports betting companies says that advertisers blasting messages on TV far and wide is alive and well. And as Mr. Bologna acknowledges, what Volvo is doing is not easy. He estimates that currently, agencies need to spend 10 times as many man hours executing such an addressable TV buy compared to a national TV campaign. [The process of] simply compiling all the data from the various partners involved and putting it all into useable formats is primitive compared to digital ad buying tools, he said. \u201cThere is nothing automated about addressability,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Bologna said that the completion of Charter Communications\u2019 acquisition of Time Warner Cable has the potential to expand the number of homes where such advanced TV advertising can happen. But after that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of infrastructure needed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty far away from this becoming\u201d possible in every TV household.\n\nStill, for the right brand, it\u2019s worth it. \u201cThis is going to be an ongoing part of our plans,\u201d said Ms. Eriksson. \u201cWe\u2019re well beyond tests.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Volvo Says It Can Target Likely Car Buyers on TV, Just Like Web Ads"}

But these days, more advertisers are looking to incorporate the best of programmatic advertising\u2014increased targeting precision and reduced workflow---while maintaining the comfort and sense of control that comes from buying ads directly from a trusted partner.\n\neMarketer predicts that more than half of programmatic ad buys involve a direct relationship between ad buyer and publisher.\n\nIn fact, TubeMogul has facilitated many such deals, prior to this new product launch, said chief executive Brett Wilson. The growing popularity of the tactic makes sense in an era of when marketers are fretting over a number of issues in online ad buying, including fraud and the reality that a large number of impressions aren\u2019t viewable.\n\nHowever, the problem with \u201cprogrammatic direct,\u201d particularly in video, is that for an advertiser to purchase a sizable amount of inventory this way, it still needs to cut a lot of different deals with individual publishers, argues Mr. Wilson. That amount of labor has the effect of negating the efficiency that programmatic promises, he contends. \u201cThere is typically a lot of work in making it happen,\u201d said Mr. Wilson.\n\nThus, with Select Access, marketers can enact direct buys with 50 well known publishers all at once. TubeMogul has signed on A+E Networks, Discovery Communications and Univision to sell a portion of their Web video ad inventory via Select Access. TubeMogul has actually been testing the product over the past few months, with brands such as 3M, Famous Footwear and Lenovo, and expects that close to 2.4 billion video ad impressions will be available this year.\n\nHow is Select Access different than an ad exchange? Mr. Wilson argues that the product provides ad buyers with more transparency and control than the average ad exchange--and that such controls will encourage a class of publishers that might otherwise be wary of the exchange model.\n\nGoogle might disagree with the idea that ad exchanges don\u2019t offer such transparency and control. The company rolled out Google Partner Select, a video ad exchange geared for premium publishers, in June of last year.\n\nJim Price, chief executive at the ad agency Empower MediaMarketing, which works with clients such as Wendy\u2019s and U.S. Bank, said that the transparency issue was something of a hot button among clients--and the fact that Select Access provides advertisers with full site lists and pricing information is appealing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having many clients shy away from ad exchanges, particular as a branding environment,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd video is a tricky subject right now [given the climate].

The TV coverage will compete with Monday Night Football on ESPN. Photo: Zuma Press\n\nIn the highly anticipated matchup between the veteran and the rookie, the loser next Monday night may be ESPN.\n\nThe first presidential debate between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump on Sept. 26 is expected to reduce ratings for ESPN\u2019s Monday Night Football, and multiple ad buyers are predicting TV viewership in the range of about 10.3 million to 11 million people for the game. That would be down 15% to 20% from last year\u2019s average Monday Night Football rating.\n\nESPN, majority owned by Walt Disney Co., already took a hit on advertising pricing because of expected competition with the debate coupled with a weaker game matchup, according to people familiar with the matter. The game is the lowest priced of any Monday night for the 16-week NFL schedule, the people said.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton duke it out across networks that night, ad buyers predict viewership for the debate may be up anywhere from 20% to 50% from the 67 million people who watched Democratic incumbent President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Gov. Mitt Romney in the first presidential debate in 2012.\n\nRatings will be up with \u201cso many people still on the fence about who to vote for and the bitterness and nasty-fighting between the two\u201d because that unfortunately makes for great TV, said Billie Gold, vice president and director of programming for the research arm at Dentsu Inc. The firm is estimating more than 80 million viewers for the debate.\n\nFor more than a year there has been outsize interest in this election, with surging audiences for primary debates and the conventions, thanks in large part to the curiosity and controversy surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. But the fact that the debate could siphon viewers away from one of the most powerful franchises on TV\u2014even if just for one game\u2014shows just how unusual this election cycle has become.\n\nThe debate, which starts at 9 p.m. Eastern time, will run without commercial breaks across all major networks, but advertisers can buy ad space in pre- and postdebate coverage. The timing means it will compete with the football game between the Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints, which starts at 8:30 p.m.\n\n\u201cThere may be some slight impact [to NFL ratings],\u201d and it may get bigger in swing states like Virginia, Ohio and Michigan, said Doug Ray, U.S. chief executive of Dentsu media company Carat.\n\nThe fact that Monday\u2019s game is between the Saints and the Falcons won\u2019t help ESPN bolster its audience, which could mean another setback after the NFL season kicked off with an early dip in ratings. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good matchup,\u201d said multiple buyers.\n\nAd buyers\u2019 estimates for 11 million viewers at most indicate that ESPN is likely to fall short of the audience it is promising advertisers. The network guaranteed advertisers 12 million to 14 million viewers, including people who tune in through the live stream, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nESPN is hoping that the ability to live stream will help its numbers against the debate.\n\n\u201cFortunately technology is such that viewers no longer need to choose,\u201d said an ESPN spokeswoman in an emailed statement. \u201cThe debate or the game can be streamed, and we\u2019ll be reminding fans of that in the coming days. We do expect we\u2019ll see a lift in our streaming numbers.\u201d\n\nAccording to multiple ad buyers, the football game airing during the Oct. 9 debate is more of a sure bet for ratings, with a matchup of more popular teams\u2014the Green Bay Packers versus the New York Giants. NBC is airing the game Sunday night and pushing its debate coverage to MSNBC.\n\nDespite the competition with football, networks airing the first debate haven\u2019t struggled to sell advertising. Multiple networks have already sold most or all of their ad space for before and after the debate.\n\nNBC sold out its ad space around the first presidential debate, moderated by \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d anchor Lester Holt, with 30-second spots costing $200,000 to $250,000, according to ad buyers.

I think when people start adjusting their video players and websites there will be a significant uptick for publishers in terms of video plays,\u201d said Jeroen Wijering, head of product at online video technology provider JW Player.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how consumers will react to having videos play automatically on mobile webpages. Some industry observers suggest Facebook\u2019s introduction of autoplay video in its News Feeds has, perhaps, helped people acclimatize to the idea.\n\nBut, in addition to potentially being distracting to some web users, autoplay videos could also increase the amount of data people consume through their wireless plans, potentially resulting in extra data charges.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re visiting a lot of sites with autoplay video then the bandwidth bill will be coming after that,\u201d Mr. Wijering said.\n\nApple added support for autoplay video in the latest version of its Safari mobile browser. That browser edition is included in the most recent version of the iOS operating system, iOS 10, which was released on Sept. 13.\n\nGoogle added autoplay video support in version 53 of its Chrome for Android mobile web browser, released on Sept. 7.\n\nVideo technology companies have already begun experimenting with autoplay web video for those browsers, and evaluating whether to include it with products they offer publishers.\n\nJW Player is in the process of adding autoplay options to its technology, which is currently used by major publishers including The Washington Post, Hearst, Vice and Mashable, Mr. Wijering said.\n\nRival online video platform Brightcove is also experimenting with and testing autoplay functionality, according to its chief technology officer, Albert Lai. \u201cI think this will result in an increase in video plays and video use in general,\u201d Mr. Lai said.\n\nSome major video publishers like ESPN and CNN say they\u2019re aware of the new autoplay support, but haven\u2019t begun using it yet.\n\nQuestions remain on how well publishers will be able to monetize autoplay web video. Brightcove\u2019s Mr. Lai said he was unsure if sophisticated online advertising technology systems would work with the feature.\n\nOften, when an autoplay video is displayed on a desktop website a \u201cpre-roll\u201d video advertisement may precede it. It\u2019s unclear if that type of ad insertion will be possible in mobile browsers, despite the updates from Google and Apple.\n\nApple and Google did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, some advertisers and advertising agencies say they don\u2019t want to pay for video ads if the audio is muted.\n\nBut there are ways publishers might attempt to monetize autoplay video without the use of complicated ad technology. Increasingly publishers and media companies are creating so called \u201cbranded content\u201d on behalf of marketers, which publishers could play automatically on their sites, for example.\n\n\u201cI think this is a great opportunity for companies offering branded content to take advantage of, in a responsible manner,\u201d Mr. Lai said.\n\nIn that scenario, publishers and brands could potentially use an approach on their websites similar to what they\u2019ve done with Facebook\u2019s autoplay and muted video.\n\n\u201cFacebook is already giving consumers a positive experience with autoplay,\u201d said Eli Chapman, managing director of media at digital agency R/GA.\n\n\u201cBrands know it\u2019s going to be muted and autoplay, so there\u2019s some opportunity there to repurpose that creative or to do similar things,\u201d Mr. Chapman added.\n\nWrite to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Apple and Google Browser Tweaks Could Boost Mobile Video"}

Photo: Alan Berner/The Seattle Times/Associated Press\n\nNewspapers are suffering an accelerating drop in print advertising, a market that already was under stress, forcing some publishers to consider significant cost cuts and dramatic changes to their print and digital products.\n\nGlobal spending on newspaper print ads is expected to decline 8.7% to $52.6 billion in 2016, according to estimates from GroupM, the ad-buying firm owned by WPP PLC. That would be the biggest drop since the recession, when world-wide spending plummeted 13.7% in 2009.\n\nThat decline is hitting every major publisher, increasing pressure on them to boost digital-revenue streams even faster to make up for lost revenue and, in some cases, even reconsider the format of their print products and the types of content they publish.\n\nMany newspapers have trimmed costs to cope with the worse-than-expected revenue decline. The New York Times Co. and Wall Street Journal-owner News Corp, likely have further head-count reductions on the way, and the Guardian and the U.K.\u2019s Daily Mail recently eliminated jobs. Analysts such as Jefferies & Co. have pared back their third-quarter estimates for publishers including the Times and Gannett Co.\n\n\u201cWe operate in a time of rapidly changing market conditions, especially in the world of print advertising,\u201d Gerard Baker, editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal, wrote Wednesday in a memo to employees. \u201cThese are days of accelerating change in the newspaper business.\u201d\n\nIn light of the steep downturn, the Journal this week announced a coming revamp of its print editions that will include the consolidation of sections and other cost reductions, moves designed to make the print newspaper more sustainable for the long haul and help accelerate the newsroom\u2019s digital transformation. Meanwhile, the Times has been working on a strategy to significantly boost digital revenue by 2020, including shifting more resources into digital initiatives and looking at ways to revamp things such as its Metro section.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a hard year for print in the first half,\u201d said Meredith Kopit Levien, chief revenue officer at the New York Times.\n\nNewspapers have been in a race against time to grow their digital revenues to make up for the collapse of print advertising. They have made strides, but face challenges on that front, including the dominance of Facebook and Google in the digital market and difficulty making money on mobile products.\n\nDuring the past decade, marketers have fled newspapers for a variety of reasons, including declining circulation, aging readership and the need to fund their digital initiatives.\n\nOther factors more recently have come into play, including the growing use of data and analytics in the media-planning process. Moreover, advertisers aggressively are pushing into online video, and marketers in sectors such as retail, financial services and telecommunications are reducing print spending.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been acceleration in the downturn this year\u201d in print advertising, said John Ridding, chief executive officer of the Financial Times. \u201cThat is partly structural towards digital and mobile and the major platforms, such as Facebook and Google.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper print-ad outlook is a worrisome prediction given that the overall global ad market is expected to grow 4% this year to $529.1 billion, with a 14% acceleration in digital-ad spending, according to GroupM. Newspapers, however, aren\u2019t alone in seeing ad dollars dry up. Global magazine ad spending is expected to decline 2.9% this year, estimates GroupM.\n\nTo help bolster digital dollars, many publishers slowly are abandoning low-rent display ads and pushing into potentially more lucrative ad offerings such as native ads, video ads and virtual reality. But so far, digital ad revenues aren\u2019t growing fast enough to offset declines in print, particularly because ads in newspapers remain relatively expensive.\n\nAlthough prices vary widely, the average CPM, which is the cost for reaching a thousand people, for a full-page ad in a national newspaper is roughly $100. Meanwhile, the average CPM for a broadcast TV ad in prime time that reaches 25- to 54-year-olds is roughly $37, according to several ad buyers.\n\nThat means that when an advertiser weighs the performance of print ads against their cost, print doesn\u2019t appear as efficient as other media when ranking return on investment, said David Murphy, chief executive officer of Novus Media, an ad-buying firm owned by ad giant Omnicom Group Inc.\n\nNewspapers have been racing to grow digital revenues to make up for the collapse of print advertising. Photo: LEON NEAL/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUsing data and analytics in the media-planning process \u201cis being leveraged by more and more national advertisers and retailers, and that is a recent phenomenon,\u201d Mr. Murphy said.\n\nJefferies analyst John Janedis has forecast an even more difficult calendar third quarter. Last month he lowered his estimates for the New York Times, predicting a 17% drop in print-ad sales, worse than his earlier projection of 14%. For Gannett and News Corp, he estimates combined print and digital ad revenues will decline 12.5% and 7%, respectively. The companies declined to comment.\n\nIn response to the print decline, the Journal may further reduce head count, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIt isn\u2019t alone. The New York Times said further downsizing is expected in the newsroom early next year. Emphasizing the importance of digital, the Times this week named A.G. Sulzberger\u2014who has focused on the newsroom\u2019s digital transformation\u2014as deputy publisher, putting him in line to become the next publisher.\n\nIn the U.K., Daily Mail & General Trust, the owner of the Daily Mail, said it was cutting more than 400 jobs last month in response to a tough ad market. Guardian Media Group, which publishes the Guardian and the Observer, slashed about 250 positions earlier this year.\n\nRelated Lost Sales Take Toll on Publicis\n\n\u201cNewspapers are a tough place to be right now,\u201d said Stephen Daintith, chief financial officer of Daily Mail & General Trust. \u201cThe decline in the U.K. has been even more severe over the last 12 months.\u201d\n\n\u2014Lukas I.

While that\u2019s a sizable audience, it\u2019s not exactly BuzzFeed territory (which claims 200 million unique global visitors).\n\nSo, what\u2019s Food52 doing with 1 million Instagram followers? The site, launched in 2009 with investment from the likes of Scripps Networks Interactive, reach that threshold in November, up from roughly 250,000 followers in January.\n\nThis year\u2019s growth enabled Food52 to quickly surpass competitors on Instagram where the average media brand draws about 254,000 followers and food brands have 112,000 on average, according to social media analytics firm Shareablee. Even the much-hyped and well-funded BuzzFeed has 1.3 million Instagram followers, by comparison.\n\nAccording to Food52\u2019s co-founder Amanda Hesser, the site has not used any paid advertising to build up its Instagram footprint. Instead, the company recognized last year that it had a budding community of fans on the Facebook -owned photo platform and decided to lean in. Here\u2019s what they\u2019ve learned:\n\nRegrams are key. This is sort of Instagram\u2019s version of a retweet, where an Instagram user can post someone else\u2019s Instragram photo in their feed, with full credit given to the original photographer in the caption. This makes the community feel like they are part of a publisher\u2019s feed, and it also helps users feel like they aren\u2019t just being pushed a photo stream from a media company, Ms. Hesser said.\n\nPublishers need to recognize that Instagram is a community. Food52 editors respond to commenters and encourage feedback from followers. According to Sharablee, Food52 had more than 17 million Instagram actions\u2014meaning interactions such as comments and likes\u2014this year, compared with just over 2 million for the average media brand on the platform.\n\nAs a result, followers now talk to each other in the comment boards and call out friends who aren\u2019t yet followers, which often leads to more followers, said Ms. Hesser. \u201cThere\u2019s a feedback loop,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, so many people who follow us are not necessarily site visitors.\u201d\n\nPosting somewhat frequently is also important on Instagram to maintain an engaged following. Food52 posts several times a day, seven days a week. There is a tricky balance though, said Ms. Hesser. \u201cYou can post too much,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd food photos sure seem to help. Perhaps Food52 has an unfair advantage, considering that sexy photos of desserts and decadent brunches are inherently part of the Instagram experience, and Food52 has made professional shots of gorgeous recipes of homemade bacon part of its DNA. Still, you don\u2019t want to overdo it on things like baked goods, said Ms. Hesser. \u201cYou could do chocolate chip cookies every day,\u201d she said. But that probably wouldn\u2019t excite many users after a while, she added.\n\nAn Instragram photo posted by Food52 on behalf of an advertiser. Photo: Instagram\n\nAnd lastly, don\u2019t be afraid to try video, Ms. Hesser says. While Instagram\u2019s 15-second video format may not be for everyone, Ms. Hesser noted that experimenting with Instagram video doesn\u2019t really carry that much risk. Food52 has found that cocktails work very well in video, as do stop-motion recipes. The key: \u201cBe useful, or be inspirational,\u201d said Ms. Hesser.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s one thing to inspire readers. But ultimately, Web publishers\u2014even in this era where social distribution is becoming more important that direct website traffic for some media companies\u2014have to consider how much time to devote to each channel. In Food52\u2019s case, Instagram is now \u201cone of the most sought after campaign elements\u201d for advertisers, said Ms. Hesser.\n\nThe publisher doesn\u2019t disclose revenue, but Ms. Hesser said that its growing Instagram presence is helping to attract new advertisers. Ad revenue is expected to increased 149% this year, and the site\u2019s unique user base has recently jumped past the 4.5 million mark in the past two month, according to comScore.\n\nFood52 does have a social media specialist who is in charge of the company\u2019s Instagram account, but at this point nearly everyone on the editorial team contributes at different times, Ms. Hesser said.\n\nUnlike many publishers, Food52\u2019s top editorial staff produces sponsored content for paying advertisers. And many brands are starting to ask for Instagram photos as part of their ad packages.\n\nAn Instragram photo posted by Food52 on behalf of an advertiser Photo: Instagram\n\nIn fact, Food52\u2019s most-liked photo to date\u2014a shot of a pie with a diagonal lattice pattern\u2014was sponsored by Simply Organic Foods. Last year, a campaign for the snack brand Annie\u2019s Homegrown, which urged Instagram users to guess how many cheddar bunnies crackers were in a fishbowl, won an industry award. As of Monday, it has 2,300 comments and counting since it went live over a year ago.\n\nWith these types of posts, \u201cour editors always ask themselves, `would we do this with or without an advertiser?\u2019\u201d said Ms. Hesser. The goal is to only publish content that meets the latter criteria.\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "How Food52 Quadrupled Its Instagram Following in a Year"}

In the case of the Hulu campaign that started in February, Mic posted an Oscar preview clip to Facebook. After three seconds, an image-based Hulu promotion appeared over a portion of the bottom of the video screen. These custom Mic ads, which Airbnb has been testing over the past few weeks, were a persistent overlay in the videos for less than five seconds.\n\nAfter CMO Today contacted Facebook about the unique ad product from Mic, Facebook noted that it\u2019s recently enacted rules on \u201cbranded content\u201d were in the process of being updated. Facebook alerted Mic about the policy change, and Mic removed the ads from its Facebook videos, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nMic\u2019s custom ads in its videos didn\u2019t fit the traditional definition of branded content, which usually refers to articles or videos that were created specifically for a paying advertiser, as opposed to just editorial content that runs with advertising.\n\nBut in this case, Facebook broadly categorizes posts featuring third-party products, brands or services as branded content--and in these posts, banners are not allowed. Though that policy wasn\u2019t so explicit with video content until recently.\n\nIndeed, it was just last month that the Silicon Valley giant announced it would start letting publishers and marketers post branded content, a policy that included some restrictions on just how overtly commercial the content could be.\n\nFor example, the rules said it was OK if publishers posted videos featuring products from paying advertisers. But advertisers weren't permitted to run any sort of banner ad in a sponsored text post or photo. Yet technically they could run a banner-type ad on top of a video, as long as this banner didn\u2019t appear during the first three seconds of that video and didn\u2019t stay on screen for more than five seconds.\n\nAs of May 10, Facebook now specifies that banner ads can\u2019t appear in videos at all.\n\n\u201cBranded content is a broad term in the media world. We knew that our recently updated Branded Content Policy would evolve through discussions with publishers and advertisers, and as people started to discover and engage with the content,\u201d Facebook said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe want to ensure that our policies are workable and encouraging when it comes to publishers and advertisers putting great content in front of people on Facebook. We\u2019re still in the early stages, but we remain committed to building a sustainable and healthy ecosystem for publishers, and we appreciate continued feedback with this new format on Facebook.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Facebook\u2019s policies, more broadly, have come under scrutiny in recent days amid allegations that its workers manipulated its ranking of popular news topics for political purposes.

WSJ's Lee Hawkins explains.\n\nFacebook Inc. said it has uncovered several more flawed measurements related to how consumers interact with content, raising more questions about the metrics marketers lean on to decide whether to buy ads on the social media network.\n\nThe company publicly disclosed on Wednesday that a comprehensive internal metrics audit found that discrepancies, or \u201cbugs,\u201d led to the undercounting or overcounting of four measurements, including the weekly and monthly reach of marketers\u2019 posts, the number of full video views and time spent with publishers\u2019 Instant Articles.\n\nNone of the metrics in question affect Facebook\u2019s billing, said Mark Rabkin, vice president of Facebook\u2019s core ads team.\n\nThis revelation comes two months after Facebook acknowledged that is had been overestimating the average viewing time for video ads on its platform for roughly two years.\n\nThat news led Facebook to take a deeper look at all of its advertising-related metrics and data.\n\nNow, after finding more examples of data miscalculations, Facebook said it would provide additional independent review of some measurements to calm unease over the social network\u2019s data.\n\nThe unveiling of the additional errors may trouble some advertisers and web publishers that rely on Facebook for distribution and monetization.\n\nSeveral had already called for additional third-party validation of Facebook\u2019s data.\n\nAs part of its effort to assuage advertiser concerns about the soundness of its metrics, Facebook will provide viewability data from third-party metrics companies such as Moat and Integral Ad Science for display ad campaigns. Previously, this data was limited to video campaigns.\n\n\u201cWe are doubling down on our efforts at third-party verification,\u201d said Carolyn Everson, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global marketing solutions.\n\nIn addition, the social-media network said it is working with ratings firm Nielsen to count Facebook video views, including both on-demand views and live viewing, as part of Nielsen\u2019s Digital Content Ratings metric.\n\nLastly, Facebook said it plans to form a Measurement Council made up of marketers and ad agency executives, and will roll out a blog to communicate more regularly on updates about measurement.\n\nAs for the newly discovered bugs, the errors apply to only four of more than 220 metrics that Facebook counts.\n\nIn one instance, Facebook found that it had been overcounting how many people were exposed to marketers\u2019 organic posts, meaning regular posts that weren't paid ads, because it was adding up the daily reach over certain periods without accounting for repeat visitors. The corrected metric on average will be about 33% lower for the seven-day period and 55% lower for the 28-day period, Facebook said.\n\nIn another case, Facebook found it had been undercounting how many people watch video ads to their completion.\n\nSome people watch video ads in their entirety, but because the audio and video tracks aren\u2019t always perfectly synced, Facebook wasn't counting some views as completed at 100%. As a result, Facebook expects the count of completed video views to increase by 35%.\n\nBecause of another calculation error, the amount of time people spend with Instant Articles was overreported by 7% to 8% on average since August 2015, Facebook said.\n\n\u201cSome of [the bugs] will have a bigger impact than others,\u201d said Mr. Rabkin. \u201cThe range of impact varies. We wanted to err on the side of fairness and transparency.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s efforts to fix its reputation with Madison Avenue may fall short of the demands from some ad buyers.\n\nFor instance, as part of the increased data verification, Facebook doesn't plan to let ad buyers track campaigns using their own ad \u201ctags,\u201d or tracking code, as some have advocated.\n\nThe lack of fully independent third-party ad verification was a major sticking point following Facebook\u2019s recent video counting mishap, particularly considering Facebook\u2019s growing dominance in the ad world.\n\nGroupM, the ad buying unit of WPP PLC, said it was encouraged that Facebook was clarifying metrics and seeking input. However, \u201ctoday\u2019s developments stop short of full third-party measurement which we still believe crucial to advertiser confidence in any market,\u201d GroupM said.\n\nOne way Facebook could calm frustrated ad buyers would be to undergo an audit via the Media Rating Council, the media industry\u2019s independent research watchdog.\n\nFollowing the recent overcounting error, the Association of National Advertisers publicly advocated for an MRC audit. This is something Facebook is now considering, Ms. Everson said.\n\nMs. Everson said that she has been in numerous conversations with marketers and ad buyers over the past eight weeks regarding metrics, and that the company wants to demonstrate how seriously it is taking these issues.\n\n\u201cClients want to have trust and confidence in their investment decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cMy desired outcome\u2026is that we are viewed as displaying complete transparency. We want to demonstrate our commitment.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Facebook Says It Found More Miscalculated Metrics"}

To the right, on a larger board above a schedule, is the phrase \u201cThurs is the New Fri!\u201d\n\nThese two boards are hung in a large office housing 10 staffers at the female-focused Web publisher Refinery29. The staffers are the team producing content for Snapchat Discover, an exclusive collection of 18 channels on Snapchat which Refinery29 officially joined on Oct. 12.\n\nThe number 33 refers to how many consecutive days Refinery29 had produced a full \u2018edition\u2019 of Snapchat Discover content. The company continues to crank out 14 pieces a day, seven days a week. The Thursday/Friday quote refers to the fact that every Thursday night, Team Refinery29 Snapchat must deliver Snapchat its Discover slate for Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\n\nRefinery 29\u2019s operation provides a window into the steps publishers must take as they dive into producing custom content for fast-evolving digital platforms like Snapchat. The disappearing message service now offers a slate of content through Discover from the likes of CNN, Vice and Cosmopolitan.\n\nPhoto: Snapchat\n\nThe media companies see the promise of huge millennial audiences and new revenue streams. But to take advantage, they must set themselves up to publish with speed and flexibility and accept that some content might not pan out, said Amy Emmerich, executive vice president of programming at Refinery29.\n\nGiven the pace and demands of the Snapchat content operation, Ms. Emmerich instituted a rule to protect staffers from getting sidetracked. \u201cNo one talks to Team Snapchat,\u201d she said. Feedback is given only after content is published. \u201cThen you iterate the next day,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the rule. It\u2019s like \u2018Fight Club.\u2019\n\nMost traditional media companies would be uncomfortable with that post-first-ask-questions-later philosophy. But it\u2019s that spirit Ms. Emmerich says drew here to start talking to Refinery29 roughly 18 months ago (she finally joined the company in January).\n\nWhat sold Ms. Emmerich on Refinery29 was the idea that the company wanted to go big on video. \u201cThey were talking about bringing stuff to Sundance,\u201d she said, refering to the film festival.\n\nWhile Refinery29 is producing documentaries of the Sundance variety, that\u2019s probably not the content that\u2019s going to work on Discover. Instead, through its first 33 days, Refinery had experimented with content that takes into account the way people consume video on Snapchat -- vertically on their phones -- while building in sharing. The tone is generally light and fun.\n\nPhoto: Snapchat\n\nSome of what Team Refinery29 Snapchat produces is created specifically for Snapchat. People love illustrations and inspirational quotes from celebrities like Emma Stone, said Samarah Daher, a programming manager at Refinery29.\n\nThe 20-somethings that create Refinery29\u2019s Snapchat content work out of a room adorned with illustrations of potential material for the social media service. On a recent afternoon, that included a nail-polish-coated closeup of a fingernail, an image of jeans on a hanger carrying the title \u201c4 Tips for Perfect Fitting Jeans,\u201d and a quiz featuring illustrations of the characters from the series \u201cGilmore Girls.\u201d Much of the daily output is repurposed from the Refinery29 library and refined for Snapchat.\n\nFor example, an article from last December, \u201c36 Celebrities Who Love Holiday Gear As Much As We Do,\u201d became \u201c36 Celebrities Who Go NUTS For Christmas\u201d--with some light animation and music added to the piece along with the ability to swipe upwards on your phone to read it.\n\n\u201cThere are ways to utilize your library content and just give it a twist,\u201d explained Justin Stefano, Refinery29 co-founder. \u201cIt\u2019s like adding a new book cover on top.\u201d\n\nMr. Stefano said the fact that Refinery29 had already established a production process for posting content to Facebook on a regular basis was helpful when the company decided to take on the Snapchat output.\n\nIt\u2019s still very early, but Refinery has learned several tricks of the Discover trade. For example, 30-day challenges don\u2019t work so well as Snapchat content. Don\u2019t overdo it on horoscopes. Videos back-to-back are not a good experience. Nor are videos right up against ads.\n\nPhoto: Refinery29\n\nOn the ad front, Refinery29 was able to nab Unilever as its charter Discover sponsor. The marketer has been running video ads for Degree and Tresemm\u00e9.\n\nGenerally, marketers have been drawn to Snapchat\u2019s self-reported daily audience of 100 million mostly young users, despite the fact that it\u2019s not necessarily proven and often the data the company provides is limited. Earlier this year Snapchat announced it would start selling Discover ads for two cents a view, which translates to roughly $20 for every thousand people reached. When publishers sell these ads, they split the revenue with Snapchat.\n\nSnapchat declined to comment.\n\nGail Tifford, vice president of media and digital engagement at Unilever North America, said the Refinery29/Snapchat opportunity came up quickly, and she had her team jump on it, funding the deal through Unilever\u2019s \u201cinnovation budget.\u201d\n\nRefinery29 produced seven custom Snapchat Discover ads for Unilever designed for Snapchat\u2019s vertical interface, and two others were created using footage from existing TV ads.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to work quickly and nimbly,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what is going to work and not work.\u201d", "date": null, "title": "Inside Refinery29\u2019s Snapchat Discover Operation"}

Photo: Associated Press\n\nThe National Football League, Walt Disney Co. and Comcast Corp. \u2019s NBCUniversal are among television content owners that are resisting striking deals with Facebook Inc. for its video features, concerned about ceding control to the social networking giant and undermining the value of their programming.\n\nFacebook has been courting premium content owners for its \u201cSuggested Videos\u201d feature and Facebook Live, its new live-streaming product, people familiar with the matter say. Media companies want to partner with Facebook to get in front of a massive pool of viewers on their phones, but they have serious concerns about Facebook\u2019s proposed deal terms and its recent algorithm changes for how content surfaces in users\u2019 News Feeds.\n\nOne major sticking point for TV channel owners: Facebook wants its ad sales force to be in charge of selling ads against TV companies\u2019 videos. That could mean that a Facebook sales rep would be able to court a media buyer by highlighting, for example, a clip from CBS \u2019 \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert, \u201d just like CBS does \u2013 a prospect that spooks TV channel owners.\n\nFacebook to Pay Internet Stars for Live Video Internet video creators and YouTube sensations stand to earn $2.2 million to experiment on Facebook Live with live broadcasts. WSJ\u2019s Steven Perlberg joins Lunch Break with Tanya Rivero with the details. Photo: Hagop Kalaidjian/BFA (Originally published July 19, 2016)\n\n\u201cIf we just have a fundamental disconnect on how ad sales works, that\u2019s a pretty big deal,\u201d said Ron Lamprecht, executive vice president of business development and digital distribution at NBCUniversal.\n\nA Facebook spokeswoman pointed to recent comments at an industry event from the company\u2019s director of product, Fidji Simo, who said that over the next few months Facebook would experiment with \u201ca lot of different models\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s probably going to take a bit of time.\u201d\n\nWhen the NFL auctioned streaming rights for Thursday Night Football, Facebook kicked the tires ( Twitter won the deal in April). Still, NFL executives are concerned that Facebook hasn\u2019t shown appreciation for the value of premium content, both in its proposed deal terms and algorithm tweaks, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe social network in June updated its users\u2019 News Feeds to prioritize posts shared by friends and family over content from publishers and public figures, like sports teams. As a result, the league worries that a guy in his basement talking about the New England Patriots, for example, would get the same exposure as a clip of a press conference by Patriots coach Bill Belichick.\n\nThough the NFL was an early Facebook video partner \u2013 the two struck a deal in late 2014 \u2013 the agreement wasn\u2019t renewed after it expired. Other sports leagues like Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer have struck deals with Facebook and say they are pleased with early results.\n\nFor media companies, Facebook represents a powerful new entrant into online video, garnering 8 billion video views per day. Several publishers, from BuzzFeed to the New York Times, have flocked to create Facebook video.\n\nTelevision companies, which are grappling with an exodus of younger viewers from traditional cable TV, could also benefit from such a massive platform. Many of them, including Disney and NBCUniversal, are dabbling in limited ways. NBCU\u2019s E! channel is making five original series for Facebook Live, and Disney has a test with \u201cSuggested Videos\u201d for some ABC and Freeform content.\n\nBut those companies haven\u2019t reached formal, overall deals with Facebook. TV executives say they\u2019ve been put off by the tech company\u2019s constantly-shifting goalposts and its failure to articulate a clear path for content owners on how they\u2019ll make money from participating in its video offerings.\n\nLast summer, Facebook unveiled \u201cSuggested Videos,\u201d which presents Facebook users with a collection of videos and ads after they click to watch a publisher\u2019s video in their feed. But Facebook\u2019s proposed ad model \u2013 where it takes a 45% cut and divvies up the rest among the publishers, based on time spent watching \u2013 fell flat with big TV companies.\n\nMore recently, as Facebook expanded into Facebook Live, the company has begun testing \u201cmid-roll\u201d commercial breaks that come within live videos. Since it is still developing a model to share ad revenue from live videos, Facebook has enticed media companies and celebrities to create live broadcasts by paying them anywhere from a few hundred thousand dollars to a few million for a one-year deal.\n\nFacebook offered Disney money in line with other media companies, with $1 million allocated for ESPN. \u201cWe didn\u2019t feel like it was enough money for all the work they wanted,\u201d a person familiar with Disney\u2019s thinking said. When Disney voiced concern about Facebook controlling the ad sales, the social network proposed an unattractive ad-revenue split for spots that Disney\u2019s ad sales team would sell, the person said.\n\nAndrew Morse, executive vice president of editorial for Time Warner Inc. \u2019s CNN, which signed a one-year, $2.5 million contract to produce Facebook live video, questioned whether the network will remain committed to the initiative.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t figure out a way to monetize it, it\u2019s hard to see the long-term viability,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Shalini Ramachandran at shalini.ramachandran@wsj.com and Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "TV Companies Resist Facebook Video Deals"}

Photo: Omar Vega/Invision/Associated Press\n\nFacebook Inc. has inked contracts with nearly 140 media companies and celebrities to create videos for its nascent live-streaming service, as the social network positions itself to cash in on a lucrative advertising market it has yet to tap\u2014and keep its 1.65 billion monthly users engaged.\n\nThe company has agreed to make payments to video creators totaling more than $50 million, according to a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Its partners include established media outfits like CNN and the New York Times ; digital publishers like Vox Media, Tastemade, Mashable and the Huffington Post; and celebrities including Kevin Hart, Gordon Ramsay, Deepak Chopra and NFL quarterback Russell Wilson.\n\nThe arrangements are a way to encourage publishers to produce a steady stream of high-quality videos until Facebook figures out a more concrete plan to compensate creators, such as through sharing of ad revenue.\n\nIn March, Facebook said it would start paying some creators to use its live-streaming product, and some publishers have acknowledged being paid by Facebook. But the document reviewed by the Journal is the most comprehensive list so far of participating content providers and their specific financial dealings with Facebook.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to invite a broad set of partners so we could get feedback from a variety of different organizations about what works and what doesn\u2019t,\u201d Justin Osofsky, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global operations and media partnerships, said in a statement.\n\nThe value of individual contracts varies widely, with 17 worth more than $1 million, according to the document. The highest-paid publisher is BuzzFeed, slated to receive $3.05 million for broadcasting live between March 2016 and March 2017. Just behind BuzzFeed is the New York Times, which is to receive $3.03 million for a 12-month deal. CNN is third, with a $2.5 million contract.\n\nThe document isn\u2019t a full accounting of all of Facebook\u2019s dealings with video creators, but it shows the broad scope of the tech giant\u2019s efforts to promote its Facebook Live product.\n\nFacebook is already a major video hub\u2014its users watch 100 million hours of video daily in their news feeds. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is betting that live videos will provide a further lift in user engagement, getting people to come to the service more often and stay longer.\n\nOne indication of the importance of live video: when publishers stream something live, Facebook automatically sends a notification to their Facebook fans.\n\nThough Facebook is an advertising powerhouse\u2014it accounts for nearly 20% of U.S. mobile ad revenues, according to eMarketer\u2014it has yet to tap into digital video as a major revenue source, unlike Alphabet Inc. \u2019s YouTube. That market, which is worth $9.8 billion in the U.S. alone, represents a big opportunity.\n\nMost publishers\u2014traditional and digital\u2014already are pouring resources into online video to capture the attention of their audiences and grab high advertising prices. Facebook is a major source of traffic to their properties. Becoming one of its live-streaming partners in the early going could give their videos enormous exposure, and could be lucrative once selling ads in the platform is allowed.\n\nIn May, 44% of the top 500 Facebook pages maintained by media companies posted at least one live video on Facebook, up from 11% in January, according to an analysis by Socialbakers, a social-media metrics company.\n\nFacebook is a \u201crelative rookie\u201d to live-streaming compared to rivals including disappearing messaging app Snapchat, Twitter Inc. \u2019s Periscope app and YouTube, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney in a note this week. But given its large user base, \u201cFacebook should be a viable competitor for consumer attention,\u201d Mr. Mahaney wrote.\n\nFacebook invited publishers to be part of the program based, in part, on their track record with live video, Mr. Osofsky said. Among other factors, Facebook also looked for public figures who were able to \u201ceasily produce and test a variety of live programming.\u201d\n\nFacebook is \u201chighly incentivized to get good content in there,\u201d said Jesse Hertzberg, chief executive of Livestream, a live-video company and maker of a $400 wide-angle Mevo camera that\u2019s directly integrated with Facebook Live.\n\nThe contract values are based on publishers\u2019 popularity on Facebook and the number of broadcasts they are willing to stream, according to Facebook and people familiar with the terms of the deals. Some contracts include requirements related to the length of individual broadcasts; in other cases, some additional payouts are available to publishers who exceed their minimum requirements.\n\nThe list reviewed by the Journal also includes the Metropolitan Museum of Art and American Museum of Natural History in New York; internet celebrities like Logan Paul, Andrew Bachelor and Lele Pons; dance music DJs Armin Van Buuren and Hardwell; and sports teams such as FC Barcelona.\n\nFood-centric web video specialist Tastemade, which in April announced it would produce more than 100 Facebook Live shows a month, is set to receive about $1 million from Facebook for videos produced in a 12-month period ending in March 2017.\n\nNews Corp \u2019s Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has no arrangement with Facebook to create videos for Facebook Live, a company spokeswoman said.\n\nThe potential power of Facebook\u2019s platform has been evident in early experiments. In April, two BuzzFeed employees streamed a Facebook Live video showing them placing rubber bands around a watermelon until it exploded. It was Facebook\u2019s most-watched live video, until it was beaten out by Facebook user Candace Payne, who in May filmed herself in her car, laughing uproariously over a noise-making Chewbacca mask.\n\nAs of June 21, the nearly 45-minute watermelon video was viewed 10.8 million times; Ms. Payne\u2019s four-minute video has been viewed 157.6 million times.\n\nAfter a live video is over on Facebook, it is stored so Facebook users can watch it later. About two-thirds of the watch time for a Facebook live broadcast happen after the fact, Facebook executives say.\n\nLive videos are intended to be exclusive to the Facebook Live platform. Based on early testing, Facebook has said it found that the average user watches live video three times longer than other types of video.\n\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com and Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Facebook Signs Deals With Media Companies, Celebrities for Facebook Live"}

The second debate on Sunday Oct. 9 will be on opposite NBC\u2019s coverage of the New York Giants vs. the Green Bay Packers. (The final debate isn\u2019t up against an NFL contest.)\n\nMr. Trump has already complained about the schedule, which is made by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d last season averaged close to 13 million viewers while NBC\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d has been the most-watched prime time program for several years and last season averaged more than 21 million viewers.\n\nSeveral presidential or vice presidential debates in the past have aired at the same time as post-season baseball games. Until 2012, the Commission had mostly avoided conflicts with the NFL. That year, one of the presidential debates between President Barack Obama and Republican contender Mitt Romney aired at the same time as \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d and the vice presidential debate was the same night as a Thursday NFL game.\n\nThat presidential debate averaged just over 59 million viewers across 11 networks, according to Nielsen. That was lower than the audience for their previous two debates, which drew 67.2 million and 65.6 million viewers respectively. It\u2019s possible the NFL game siphoned off viewers - but there are other possible factors, such as the fact it was the last of three debates and viewer interest may have diminished.\n\nLikewise, the debate may have taken a bite out of the ratings for ESPN\u2019s matchup between the Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions, which averaged almost 11 million viewers. For the 2012 season, ESPN averaged 12.8 million viewers per-game. The game was also a low-scoring and mundane affair, and it was competing against not only the debate, but also a deciding game of the National League Championship series on Fox.\n\nGiven that the debates air on multiple networks and more than half the country has a digital video recorder to record one program while watching the other, it is not as if viewers must choose between the debate or football.\n\nStill, there are four nights of the week without football, raising the question as to why the Commission would intentionally schedule against the most popular programming on television.\n\nIn a statement, the Commission said, \u201cIt is impossible to avoid all sporting events, and there have been nights which debates and games occurred in most election cycles.\u201d\n\nBoth the Commission and the NFL have said they have no plans to change their schedule.\n\nRepresentatives for ESPN and NBC declined to comment.\n\nWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Presidential Debates Face NFL Blitz"}

By September, E! will stream a regularly scheduled show at 4 p.m. PST each weekday on Facebook.\n\nThe new lineup kicks off Monday with \u201cTV Therapy,\u201d which will take fans through TV highlights from the past week. Then, starting Aug. 16, each Tuesday E! will feature \u201cSo True, So False,\u201d a pop culture-themed show culled from a regular segment that\u2019s part of the linear network\u2019s \u201cE! News\u201d franchise.\n\nOther planned shows include \u201cState Your Case,\u201d during which the merits of entertainment franchises will be debated (like \u201cStar Wars\u201d versus \u201cStar Trek\u201d), and \u201cAnother 15 Minutes,\u201d a viral video-themed show.\n\nThe shows will all stream live on Facebook and may eventually be distributed on YouTube and Periscope. John Najarian, executive vice president and general manager of E! News and digital businesses, said that the network is currently talking to advertisers about integrating their products and messages into the live shows, but there are no current plans for Facebook to deliver video ads during the series. Facebook has started testing running short ads during Facebook Live broadcasts, according to Ad Age.\n\nE! has already been experimenting with Facebook Live. Since 2012, the network has streamed \u201cLive From E!,\u201d a daily live web series that made its debut on eonline.com and moved to Facebook in March. That show, which airs at 9:30 PST each weekday, already generates roughly 150,000 viewers a day, said Mr. Najarian.\n\nWhile E! has long focused on entertainment news, this new set of series was created using formats designed to incite conversation, hopefully taking advantage of the \u201ccommunal nature of Facebook Live,\u201d he said.\n\nOf course, E! Is hardly the only media company experimenting with Facebook Live. But the network\u2019s experience in producing live TV gives E! a leg up, believes Mr. Najarian. \u201cIn terms of quality and reach, we\u2019ve had a hard time finding anyone doing close to what we are doing,\u201d he said.\n\nFor E!, the challenge will be to create a regular web video habit for a generation of young consumers who largely reject scheduled, linear TV.\n\nBut Mr. Najarian cautioned that the new slate of Facebook Live shows wasn't designed as a TV replacement for cord-cutters.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the long game for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are looking to super serve our audience. We are not thinking about driving people to tune in to the network [with these shows].

It\u2019s a model that has worked for decades for TV networks, which typically air previously-taped shows on a \u201clinear\u201d schedule.\n\nAs Facebook ramps up its live-video efforts, some media companies wonder if airing pre-recorded content in this fashion may give it greater exposure in users\u2019 feeds compared with simply uploading content through the social network\u2019s non-live video posting feature.\n\nNowThis, a news company that publishes entirely on social platforms, experimented with the option in late April, for example, streaming a 38-minute compilation of its \u201cfavorite\u201d viral videos via Facebook Live. The stream received over 20,000 views and over 500 comments, according to Facebook\u2019s counters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still early days with live video on Facebook so this was a test and an experiment\u201d, said Athan Stephanopoulos, president at NowThis. \u201cWe decided to take a bunch of viral videos and run them live. Then we were getting involved in the comments.\u201d\n\nA Facebook spokesman said the social network doesn\u2019t have policies stating that video streamed via Facebook Live actually has to be recorded live. The company does not recommend streaming pre-recorded content, the spokesman added, because a strength of the feature is the ability for on-camera hosts to interact with viewers in real time.\n\nMr. Stephanopoulos said NowThis is not currently planning to consistently stream pre-recorded footage, but added that his company thinks it\u2019s important to experiment with new video features on Facebook.\n\nThe pre-recorded feature is encouraging some media companies to promote their Web series to \u201cair\u201d on Facebook Live at a certain time, in a similar manner to a linear television show. After they are streamed, Facebook Live videos function as normal Facebook videos. Some publishers believe videos may perform better if they begin as live ones.\n\n\u201cWhat is the downside? I can\u2019t imagine that there is one. We will see when we try it. Facebook is prioritizing live. They are prioritizing video,\u201d said Cory Haik, chief strategy officer at self-professed \u201cmillennial\u201d news site Mic, which is considering uploading its Web series \u201cThe Movement\u201d as a live video. \u201cWe would just upload that video natively anyway. It\u2019s effectively the same thing.\u201d\n\nMedia companies and publishers are increasingly experimenting with Facebook\u2019s emerging live-streaming platform, which is bringing in huge viewership numbers for some. In recent weeks, the company has introduced an \u201cAPI\u201d that allows media organizations to step up their Facebook Live production value in a variety of different ways, like overlaying captions on the screen.\n\nThis week, Mic will interview Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and \u201croll tape\u201d from the interview within a later live show that discusses politics, giving the show a cable news-like feel. Ms. Haik said Facebook Live allows for commenters to feel engaged with a real-time event.\n\nLive video technology company Telestream was one of Facebook\u2019s first live video API partners, and says it\u2019s currently working with a range of media companies and publishers to help power their Facebook Live efforts.\n\nBarbara DeHart, Telestream\u2019s vice president of desktop and cloud business, said the company has not yet noticed a large amount of pre-recorded video being broadcast via Facebook Live, but added that the social network has not indicated any restrictions around what can and can\u2019t be streamed to the feature.\n\n\u201cFacebook has been very forthcoming and helpful around what it thinks would be most helpful to users,\u201d Ms. DeHart said. \u201cAt the moment that\u2019s really been around high production value.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com and Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Facebook \u2018Live\u2019 Doesn\u2019t Have to Be Live"}

Facebook will now allow branded content to appear in all forms, as long as media companies and marketers go through a simple verification process, said Dan Rose, Facebook\u2019s vice president of partnerships.\n\nAdvertisers and Web publishers will be able to post articles, videos and images that marketers have paid for to their Facebook pages; to date, they have only been able post such content within ad units. The new policy for so-called \u201corganic content\u201d applies to Facebook Instant Articles, video and even the new Facebook Live product.\n\n\u201cFor a long time, for media companies, Facebook has been primarily about distribution. But we\u2019re increasingly trying to help partners make money,\u201d said Mr. Rose. \u201cAnd this is something they\u2019ve been asking for a lot.\u201d\n\nThis change should be welcome news to publishers like BuzzFeed and Forbes, which have made sponsored content a staple of their ad offerings. And for Facebook, the new policy should theoretically bring in more revenue. Marketers and their media partners will likely run ads on Facebook to make sure that more people can see this sponsored content in their news feeds.\n\nBranded content on the site will be required to feature a new icon designed to make it clear to consumers that the content comes from a paying advertiser.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Federal Trade Commission issued guidelines on native advertising late last year and has been vocal in urging publishers and advertisers to be more clear in labeling sponsored content. Facebook said its effort wasn't aimed at addressing any FTC concerns, saying that responsibly lies with publishers and marketers.\n\nFacebook\u2019s policy used to explicitly state that \u201cthird-party advertisements on Pages are prohibited, without our prior permission.\u201d\n\nBut now, Clare Rubin, Facebook\u2019s product manager, wrote in a blog post that \u201cbranded content is a growing and evolving part of the media landscape.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople will now be connected to more of the content they care most about on Facebook as publishers and influencers gain an incentive to share more quality content, of all kinds, with their fans,\u201d she wrote.\n\nFacebook is also introducing a new tool to help brands better track when media partners, or even paid celebrities, post content featuring their products. Mr. Rose said this tool will help companies identify which sponsored posts are resonating with users, and they can pay to run more ads promoting this content.\n\nThere are some restrictions. While a brand like Pepsi could post a video featuring a social media star holding a can of soda, or a company like BuzzFeed could post a list produced on behalf of a big movie advertiser, this content can\u2019t feature blatant ad formats such as pre-roll video ads or banner ads.", "date": null, "title": "Facebook to Allow Media Companies, Marketers to Post Sponsored Content"}

Some media companies are optimistic Facebook could soon become the next big platform where they can make money from video ads, yet others believe Facebook has a way to go in terms of fine-tuning its user experience and ad model for video.\n\nFacebook introduced Suggested Videos last summer as a way to help users discover more video content on the platform and to help professional video publishers generate revenue without resorting to pre-roll video ads. When people click to watch a publisher\u2019s video in their feed, they are then presented with a scrollable collection of other \u201csuggested\u201d videos to watch. While no ad runs before the start of the first clip, after that ads from brands like Heineken are interspersed between some videos.\n\nThe ad revenue is divvied up between Facebook and the publishers whose videos run during the same viewing session as the ad. However, at this point, users don\u2019t have to watch any ads if they don\u2019t want; they can simply skip over them.\n\n\u201cWe are really committed to monetization for video on Facebook,\u201d said Fidji Simo, director of product management for video at Facebook. \u201cWe really want to find [something that works well]. This is a first step. It\u2019s very early. We are really open to hearing all of the feedback and finding the right model.\u201d\n\nOne of the goals of the initiative was to get users to start viewing Facebook as a video destination and not just a place where people chance upon videos in their news feeds. There is no question that video viewership on Facebook has ballooned over the past few years; the site now generates 8 billion video views a day.\n\nDefy Media, which manages youth-skewing video brands like Smosh, has seen consumption of its clips trending upward specifically from Suggested Videos. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised,\u201d said Defy Media\u2019s president Keith Richman.\n\nFacebook rolled out the Suggested Videos menu gradually\u2014first on iO6 devices, then on desktop. It became available to the entire Facebook audience as of the start of 2016.\n\nSo far, revenue has been tiny. Several publishers say that Facebook Suggested Videos have regularly generated a few thousand dollars a month. One video partner said it took the time to calculate how much money it was bringing in from Facebook Suggested Videos relative to how many videos it delivers via the product\u2014and the rate paled in comparison to other video platforms.\n\nOne issue some publishers have with Suggested Videos is that ad revenue mechanics are a bit of a mystery. Like YouTube, Facebook gives 55% of the ad revenue to its partners. But, unlike YouTube\u2014which mostly sells pre-roll video ads before a single piece of content\u2014Facebook must split the revenue between multiple partners since the ads are sprinkled in between a carousel of videos.\n\nFacebook calculates which partners get which portion of the 55% based on how much time the viewer spent with each video during a given session. But the partners say they are somewhat in the dark about how they get paid, making it difficult to plan.\n\nSteven Oh, chief business officer at the progressive-leaning news firm the Young Turks, said that while ad revenue from Suggested Videos is growing every month, \u201cIt\u2019s still a low number,\u201d he said.\n\nMost media partners agree that it\u2019s early days. Given Facebook\u2019s history of gradually tweaking its products before going big, many urge patience.\n\n\u201cThis is still very much in a test phase,\u201d said Athan Stephanopoulos, president at NowThis, which has aggressively pushes content to social platforms. \u201cWhat I can sense is that they are working really hard to figure it out. We think it can be a lot more and will be a lot more.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that none of the major broadcast networks have signed on to participate in Suggested Videos. NBC doesn\u2019t distribute clips from \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d through this outlet, nor does CBS for \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\u201d ABC and ESPN are also not distributing clips via Facebook Suggested Videos, though Walt Disney Co. sibling Maker Studios is testing the product. Fox Broadcasting isn't participating, but Fox Sports is.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that until last year, both ABC and NBC chose not to run ads next to their late-night clips on YouTube until they were able to reach palatable agreements with parent company Google.\n\nMany of the big TV networks aren't happy with Facebook taking a 45% cut of the ad revenue from Suggested Videos and then sharing the rest among multiple partners based on time spent, say people familiar with the matter. Some of these networks also don\u2019t like the idea that they don\u2019t have the right to sell ads themselves next to their clips on Facebook.\n\nViacom has been promoting Amy Schumer's Comedy Central series on Facebook. Photo: Facebook\n\nAmong the early participants, feedback has been all over the map.\n\nChris Berend, CNN\u2019s vice president for video development, said that overall the company has enjoyed exponential video growth on Facebook, including a significant rise since last fall.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that\u2019s purely from Suggested Videos,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they delivered what we thought they were going to do. They did not make a lot of huge promises. We are seeing modest revenue, which we think will grow over time.\u201d\n\nOne thing publishers like about Suggested Videos is that right now, it\u2019s for professional media companies only. In other words, publishers aren't competing for ad space with user-generated content.\n\nAnother promising aspect is that the product is helping publishers reach new people who haven\u2019t necessarily gone to Facebook looking for their brand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still not a volume play, but we are getting our videos in front of people who might not see them in their news feeds,\u201d said Joe Fullman, director of marketing at The Onion.\n\nOther Suggested Video partners are less than positive. One participant knocked the user experience and wondered whether Facebook was simply using the product to get more video on its platform. This person was also critical of the fact that consumers can skip past ads if they choose. Facebook counts an ad as having been viewed when a person watches for at least three seconds.\n\nMr. Oh at the Young Turks said Suggested Videos needs a total rethink. The product is hard for the average Facebook user to find, and since Facebook has trained people to watch video without sound, many never click on videos and stay for more, he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of faith that this is a long-term solution,\u201d Mr. Oh said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is the best method of getting people used to the concept.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Publishers Say Jury Is Still Out on Facebook\u2019s Suggested Videos Product"}

Photo: Volvo\n\nTHE 2016 VOLVO XC90 T6 is pretty newsy, as we say in the trades. A new all-wheel-drive vehicle architecture with seven-passenger seating; a complex 2.0-liter, 313-hp supercharged and turbocharged four-cylinder engine with eight-speed auto; interior d\u00e9cor and fitment like glory\u2019s gates, darling; and a wowing list of driver-assist tech (accident-avoiding automatic braking, for example) meant to reassert Volvo\u2019s ethos of progressive safety.\n\nThe Torslanda, Sweden-based firm has vowed to reduce death and serious injuries involving its cars to zero by the year 2020, including safeguarding those outside the vehicle, like cyclists and pedestrians. Even those who have it coming.\n\nAre you actually in the market for a luxury SUV? Your timing is propitious. This thing plants a tasteful Scandinavian ax between the ears of several prominent players, including the BMW X5, Audi Q7 and\u2014aaeiii!\u2014the relevant Lincoln.\n\nAUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE | It\u2019s no self-driving car, but the Volvo XC90 T6 Inscription is loaded with advanced driver-assist technologies. Photo: Volvo Car Group\n\nThere is a queue, however. Volvo reports it has taken 57,000 orders globally, a tidy 14% above the line. They have put on another shift of elves at Torslanda to crank them out.\n\nFriend and foe alike are glad to see Volvo back. In Monterey this month I chauffeured two of the most cruelly judgmental car snobs I know in an XC90 T6 Inscription edition ($55,400 before options, $66,705 as tested). They climbed in the mid-row of space-station-style bucket seats and promptly declared it brilliant. Volvo is quite pleased with its safer seat design, which incorporates a crush structure to absorb crash energy in the vertical axis\u2014the kind of backbreaking that might occur if you drove off the road. The cabin is banded in a wainscoting of diagonally grained lumber, and it\u2019s lurid with indirect lighting like a Stockholm oxygen bar. My God, this thing looks like adults designed it.\n\nThe XC90 is the Big Pivot, product-wise. It\u2019s the first model to be built on the Scalable Product Architecture (SPA) that will soon underpin just about everything Volvo sells in the U.S. Rather than aluminum, SPA places its structural bets on exotic strains of high-strength boron steel. Aluminum, though lighter, typically requires parts to be larger to carry the same loads; in other words, aluminum consumes packaging space. The SPA\u2019s relatively low-profile construction brilliantly carves out interior cubic inches, allowing it to situate true, three-row seating, arm\u2019s-length spaciousness, and ample cargo.\n\n2016 Volvo XC90 T6 Inscription Photo: Volvo Car Group Base price: $55,400 Price, as tested: $66,705 Powertrain: supercharged and turbocharged, direct-injection DOHC in-line four-cylinder gas engine with variable valve timing; eight-speed automatic transmission with manual-shift mode; front-biased full-time all-wheel drive. Horsepower/torque: 313 hp at 5,700 rpm/295 pound-feet between 2,200-4,500 rpm Length/weight: 194.8 inches/4,627 pounds Wheelbase: 117.5 inches 0-60 mph: 6.1 seconds (manufacturer) EPA fuel economy: 20/25 mpg, city/highway Cargo capacity: 85.7 cubic feet (behind first row) Rated towing capacity: 5,000 pounds\n\nIf you fold flat both rows of seats, the XC90 presents a whopping 85 cubic feet of cargo space. BMW X5? 66. Range Rover Sport: 62. Jeep Grand Cherokee: 68. Mercedes-Benz GLC: 56. You get the idea.\n\nSteel is also famously resilient. Volvo promises SPA-based vehicles will be its most crash-hardened automobiles ever. I believe it. The slo-mo crash test video is appalling.\n\nBut in the first minute behind the wheel, your hero is a guy named Robin Page. Hired away from Bentley, Volvo\u2019s director of interior design ushered in the XC90\u2019s smart, debonair and impeccably Scandinavian style notes, and it\u2019s he who splurged on top-shelf materials, including the crystal-glass gearshift sourced from Orrefors, lah-tee-dah. The cabin\u2019s marquee item is what Volvo calls the Sensus Connect interface, a 9-inch central portrait touch screen amid a sensual rhythm of book-matched, natural-finish wood trim and topstitched leather everything across the front cabin. All the cabin landmarks, from vents to steering controls, are limned in pencil-thin polished brightwork.\n\nThe touch screen in our test car, which uses an infrared sensor to react even before you touch the screen, did not operate quite flawlessly. Mine kept presenting me with the seat-temperature controls when I raised my hand anywhere nearby.\n\nBut the navi, phone, connected functions and audio\u2014here hooked up to the Bowers & Wilkins premium surround sound ($2,650)\u2014were fluent and didactic, with serene, sophisticated graphics.\n\nIt\u2019s the little things. The Start switch between the seats is a lightly twisting electric switch with a hammered-metal ring. Behind that, the drive-mode selector is a small, rotating drum with the same hand-hammered pattern. Is this a distant metaphorical nod to Thor\u2019s Mjolnir?\n\nThe central console\u2019s concealer panel\u2014of sustainable wood, I trust\u2014is laser cut in thin segments so as to appear solid when closed, an obvious quote of Scandinavian carved-wood design. In case you missed the point, tiny Swedish flags are tastefully sewn into the shoulders of the leather seats.\n\nCrucially, this architecture will accommodate a plug-in powertrain. Coming late this year, the XC90 T8 Twin Engine hybrid will augment the T6\u2019s 313-hp super-turbo with an 87-hp electric motor to the back axles. Total output is rated at 400 hp and a wild 472 pound-feet of torque, to go with its Prius-like 59 grams carbon per kilometer.\n\nThat\u2019s on point: If the current XC90 has a soft spot, it\u2019s in the initial effort and feeling of strain in acceleration. It feels as if something is missing because it is: that urgency off idle that an electric-traction motor would provide. It\u2019s just a moment of gracelessness, then it passes. The 4,627-pound Volvo accelerates with mood-stabilized tranquility to 60 mph in 6.1 seconds. Our tester was fitted with four-corner air suspension ($1,800), replacing the coils and integrated link of standard T6 models, and shod with 21-inch wheels.\n\n\u2018This thing plants a tasteful Scandinavian ax between the ears of the BMW X5, Audi Q7 and the relevant Lincoln.\u2019\n\nThe XC90 is exceedingly amiable to drive\u2014electric steering is light, the minimum turning radius is city-friendly; and if you want, it will find a parking spot and put you in it (Park Assist, part of the $1,800 Convenience package). The designed-in serenity will have you questioning materialism itself. Just toppers, Sven.\n\nHowever, if you are the sort who hates newfangled gadgets, this is not the car for you\u2014except you\u2019re probably the kind of driver who most could benefit. Our car fairly bristled with sensors and cameras of various purpose and wavelength, including the sizable optical unit at the windshield header, enabling the car to see lane markings on road, keep to the lane and follow the car ahead at a selected distance.\n\nWhile this function isn\u2019t automatic\u2014some minimum driver involvement is required, just to make sure you\u2019re still awake\u2014it\u2019s an extraordinary, now-ordinary step forward in lowering driver workload, appearing in lots of premium and luxury cars. Stop shaking your cane at me.\n\nMore intriguing still is Volvo\u2019s City Safety automatic braking, to avoid or mitigate collision with another car, as well as to avoid pedestrians and cyclists. If you try to pull out in front of crossing traffic, the car will try very hard to warn you and stop you. It watches cross traffic at the rear as well. It can also sense an impending rear-end collision and brace for impact.\n\nEven the XC90\u2019s warning chimes of impending death are pleasant.\n\nWrite to Dan Neil at Dan.Neil@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Volvo XC90 T6 Inscription: A Luxury SUV Worthy of Thor\u2019s Hammer"}

The product, which PopSugar Inc. acquired in 2007, was responsible for driving $1 billion in revenue to its retail partners last year, according to Brian Sugar, PopSugar Inc.\u2019s founder and chief executive.\n\nStarting in April, ShopStyle won\u2019t just redirect shoppers to complete purchases on retailers\u2019 sites. Instead, people will be able to fill out a profile, enter their credit card information, and make purchases from dozens of retailers directly through the ShopStyle site and app.\n\nEssentially, ShopStyle wants to evolve from serving a role akin to Kayak\u2014which helps people find deals across multiple airline websites\u2014to that of iTunes, but for apparel. To facilitate this evolution, PopSugar Inc. purchased the mobile shopping technology firm Cosmic Cart in November.\n\nTo date, when people search for products on ShopStyle and make purchases on other sites, PopSugar Inc. takes a roughly 15% cut of each transaction. That revenue sharing arrangement won\u2019t change with the new product, but the company believes that the more people who sync their credit card information with ShopStyle, the more purchases they\u2019ll complete from partners like Target, Express and Topshop. That means more money will flow to PopSugar Inc..\n\nPopSugar Inc. plans to promote the new ShopStyle Checkout on its own site, and the product will be enabled on a network of 14,000 partner blogs and niche websites. The benefit for consumers is that they\u2019ll be able to shop for products from Nicole Miller and Neiman Marcus and not have to jump from ShopStyle to these companies\u2019 sites or apps to complete purchases.\n\nThat potential for convenience is a big deal in mobile, explained Mr. Sugar, who said that consumers complete mobile purchases at one-third of the rate they do following desktop searches on ShopStyle, primarily due to friction in the checkout process. Customers can avoid slow loading apps, or having to enter their address and credit card information on a mobile device. Currently, 71% of PopSugar.com and ShopStyle\u2019s traffic comes from mobile devices.\n\n\u201cMobile shopping has been a growth area for Neiman Marcus and we would expect to see improvements in mobile conversion with this solution,\u201d said Wanda Gierhart, chief marketing officer at Neiman Marcus Group.\n\nPopSugar\u2019s push into mobile shopping comes as the digital media business grapples with its place in e-commerce. Many magazine brands have struggled to drive purchases from their websites. And recently, Thrillist.com announced plans to separate its editorial operations from its sister shopping brand JackThreads after previously blending the two businesses.\n\nYet, on the other hand, media companies like Gawker and Vox are experimenting with weaving shopping deals together with editorial coverage.\n\nMr. Sugar said the key for PopSugar Inc. has been to create a separate brand.\n\nWhen someone visits ShopStyle.com or its app, \u201cthey have intent to shop,\u201d said Mr. Sugar, who prior to launching PopSugar Inc. logged stints at JCrew.com and Kmart\u2019s defunct e-commerce play Bluelight.com. \u201cWith content, [shopping can work] but the user intent isn\u2019t the same,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think there is an opportunity to become the iTunes or App Store of fashion and accessories.\u201d\n\nThe checkout process for ShopStyle on a mobile device Photo: PopSugar\n\nOf course, Mr. Sugar acknowledged that he\u2019s potentially taking on giants like Amazon in this quest.\n\n\u201cAmazon is an amazing company,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you go back to the types of merchants that sell there, it\u2019s great for commodity-based goods. Our brands are different.\u201d\n\nShopStyle features 18 million products from over 1,400 retailers across the globe. Mr. Sugar said that ShopStyle reaches 18 million unique visitors each month, based on its internal data, and generates half a million shopping sessions each month.\n\nMeanwhile, the decade-old PopSugar.com boasts of over 40 million unique users, according to comScore. The company pulled in $150 million in revenue in 2015, said a person familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been profitable for five years,\u201d said Mr. Sugar.\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "PopSugar Wants to Become the Mobile Shopping Cart for Fashion"}

The site, which features articles like \u201cWhat is Doing a Boudoir Shoot Actually Like?\u201d and \u201cThis Girl\u2019s Letter to Hillary Will Warm Your Heart\u201d has seen its traffic almost triple in the past year to an all-time high of 31.6 million unique visitors in September, according to comScore Inc.\n\nNearly half that traffic is made up of women between the ages of 18 and 34, a demographic much sought-after by marketers.

Photo: Getty Images\n\nDespite numerous warnings that the online advertising business is rife with fraud, marketers continue to waste billions--an estimated $7 billion, at least, this year--on buying online ads that people do not see, according to the Association of National Advertisers.\n\nThe trade group and ad fraud detection firm White Ops Inc. conducted a study last year that tracked online ad buys of 49 brands from August through September and found that fraud levels are \u201crelatively unchanged\u201d from a similar study the two parties conducted in 2014.\n\nOnce a dirty little secret, the problem of fake Web traffic generated by so called \u201cbots,\u201d computer programs that mimic the mouse movements and clicks humans make to give the impression that a person is visiting a website that then lures in advertisers, has gotten a significant amount of attention over the past few years.\n\nTrade groups and others have sought to inform marketers about the dangers that lurk on the Web and expose just how big of a financial drain the problem has become by conducting studies. As a result, marketers, publishers and trade groups have been trying to clean up the problem of bogus online traffic.\n\nBut so far there has been little change, according to the most recent study. Moreover, for some advertisers that participated in the 2015 study, things got worse and more fraud traffic was detected.\n\nThe ANA said that in the 2015 study advertisers found between 3% to 37% of their ad impressions were created by bots compared to the prior study where the bot traffic ranged from 2% to 22%.\n\nBob Liodice, chief executive of ANA, said the industry has been slow to take action and must do more to fix the vexing problem. \u201cAs an industry, when faced with huge issues, we become paralyzed,\u201d he added.\n\nCompanies could lose more than $7 billion globally this year to ad fraud, the ANA and White Ops estimate.\n\nANA members that participated in the study include McDonald\u2019s, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Unilever. White Ops estimates that the participants could have lost $250,000 to $42 million on an annualized basis because of fraud. The company came up with those figures by taking the study period losses and extrapolating them for the year.\n\nThe bad guys creating fraudulent traffic make money in several ways, including by creating their own websites and using the fake audience to attract advertisers or by charging legitimate publishers to direct traffic to their sites.\n\nThe new study showed that display and video ads bought using automated systems continued to be a problem area and had a significantly higher level of fraud compared to ads that were purchased via human sales forces. Video ads, one of the fast-growing parts of the online ad business, preformed far worse than display ads bought \u201cprogrammatically.\u201d\n\nAnother red flag: Ads bought from publishers that use so called \u201csourced traffic,\u201d which is when publishers hire third-party firms to drive traffic to their websites, were three-times as likely have fake traffic, White Ops found.\n\nWhite Ops Chief Executive Michael Tiffany said trying to clean up the problem is tough.\n\nThe reason for fraud still creeping in, Mr. Tiffany said, was that many of the advertisers still bought ads from exchanges that sell ad space on less premium Web sites, where fraud levels can be higher. And on direct buys (non-automated), the advertisers did nothing to disincentivize traffic sourcing, a key source of bots.\n\nDespite the ongoing fraud problems, digital ad spending continues to grow at an impressive clip. Display ad spending in the U.S. grew 24.1% to $26.15 billion last year while spending on online video ads jumped 42.4% to $7.46 billion, estimates eMarketer.\n\n\u201cTheoretically, we [marketers] should be pulling back from the digital supply chain because of all the issues such as fraud, the lack of transparency, ad-blocking and viewability,\u201d said Mr. Liodice.\n\nStill, Mr. Liodice believes advertisers will pull back \u201cif we do not successfully mitigate these issues.\u201d\n\nWrite to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Bogus Web Traffic Continues to Plague the Ad Business"}

Kia Motors of America COO Michael Sprague joins Tanya Rivero on Lunch Break with a behind-the-scenes look at the ambitious new campaign. Photo: Kia Motors of America\n\nAt first glance, Kia\u2019s Super Bowl advertisement is standard big-game fare: a well-known celebrity, Christopher Walken, will try to hawk a midsize sedan to more than a hundred million viewers hooked to their televisions.\n\nBut for its seventh Super Bowl appearance, the auto maker is hoping to add some extra star power by employing some unlikely assistance. IBM\u2019s Watson will help identify \u201csocial media influencers\u201d who can buoy Kia\u2019s message before and during the 60-second spot.\n\nWatson, the artificial intelligence software known for once toppling the best human competitors on \u201cJeopardy,\u201d has the ability to parse through the language used on social media to determine which influencers exhibit the personality traits desired by Kia, such as \u201copenness to change,\u201d \u201cartistic interest\u201d and \u201cachievement-striving.\u201d\n\nSocial media stars chosen by Kia include actor James Maslow, who has more than 3 million Twitter followers, and musicians Wesley Stromberg and Drew Chadwick, who have 765,000 and 452,000, respectively.\n\n\u201cResearch has shown that the word choice we use when we communicate reflect aspects of our personality,\u201d said Steve Abrams, director of technology for Watson Ecosystem at IBM. \u201cThey can say something about whether we\u2019re introverted or extroverted\u2026whether we value openness or adventure or value more conservatism.\u201d\n\nFor the campaign, Kia sent colorful socks to about 100 influencers who will make content and use Kia\u2019s hashtag, #AddPizzazz. The main conceit of the Super Bowl ad, dubbed \u201cWalken Closet,\u201d is that Kia\u2019s vehicle is the fun, multicolored sock in a world of otherwise bland, beige socks.\n\nKia\u2019s Super Bowl ad\n\nDissecting the psyches of social media personalities for the sake of sedan sellers may not seem like the most natural use of Watson, which has also been used to help doctors make sense of vast collections of medical information. But Watson has struck a range of partnerships in recent years, with resulting products ranging from online-shopping apps to hotel concierge services to fan sentiment trackers for sporting events.\n\nTo use Watson, Kia worked with Influential, a company that connects marketers to people with significant followings across platforms such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Influential is one of more than 100 partners that have launched commercial products, apps or services built upon Watson, according to Mr. Abrams. IBM and Influential have a revenue-sharing agreement.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective, we always thought [Watson] was big companies using it for really big, complex issues,\u201d said Michael Sprague, chief operating officer at Kia Motors America. \u201cThis is a way they\u2019ve been able to really bring it down to the consumer level.\u201d\n\nThe campaign comes at a time when influencer marketing has become more in vogue. The practice has also sparked the interest of the Federal Trade Commission, which has stepped up efforts to ensure it\u2019s clear when social media posts are paid for by brands.\n\nIt has become commonplace for brands to release their spots early to drum up digital buzz and get the most bang for their buck from the pricey Super Bowl commercials. CBS has said it is fetching as much as $5 million for 30 seconds of ad time for the Feb. 7 event.\n\nTwo other companies, sock-maker Stance and Twitter-owned social media creator network Niche, helped identify additional influencers for the Kia campaign.\n\nUltimately, the hope is that the influencers identified by Watson won\u2019t just have big followings, but will also be sure to align with Kia\u2019s message.\n\n\u201cYou want to make sure any brand ambassador is semantically relevant,\u201d said Ryan Detert, CEO of Influential.\n\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "IBM\u2019s Watson Helped Pick Kia\u2019s Super Bowl \u2018Influencers\u2019"}

That\u2019s roughly twice as long as it takes for ads to render, meaning that they appear in full, on desktop websites.\n\nGeorge Ivie, the MRC\u2019s chief executive, said the organization recently conducted research on ad load time for tens of millions of mobile ads and found that \u201cmobile ads render considerably slower than desktop ads.\u201d\n\nSlow-loading mobile ads could prove problematic for the ad industry for a number of reasons. First and foremost, the slower ads load, the easier it is for mobile users to blow right past them. For publishers, it makes it tougher to sell advertisers on the power of marketing in this still nascent medium when they have don\u2019t have complete confidence that most people will even see such ads.\n\nThat\u2019s a potentially big headache for the burgeoning mobile ad industry, as millions of Americans spend more time on smartphones, and as marketers and media companies reorient their business models to help reach these phone-obsessed consumers. According to Nielsen, adults spent an average of one hour and 39 minutes a day on a smartphone in the first quarter, up 60% from a year earlier.\n\nThere are a number of factors contributing to mobile advertising\u2019s sluggish nature, said Mr. Ivie, such as bandwidth and network speeds. But in general, mobile ads are too heavy, he said.\n\nIndeed, heavy ads are an industrywide problem that has gained more attention lately, as publishers complain that creative agencies are producing oversize digital ad creative that doesn\u2019t translate well on mobile devices. And both consumers and marketers are complaining that too many ads are packed with multiple ad-tracking mechanisms\u2014sometimes involving multiple third-party ad tech providers\u2014which all slow the ad experience and contribute to the rising use of ad blocking.\n\n\u201cThis is because of heavy ads. Lighter ads and more efficient ads, with less back-end piggy backing and tagging, is the answer to this,\u201d said Mr. Ivie.\n\nThe MRC uncovered this mobile slowness as it was preparing to release its official guidelines for tracking mobile ad viewability, which the organization released Tuesday.\n\nEssentially, the MRC\u2019s standards for mobile viewability mirror those that have been adopted for desktop ads. A mobile ad is counted as viewable if 50% of it is in view on a person\u2019s screen for at least one second\u2014two seconds if it is a video ad.\n\nThe twist this time with the MRC\u2019s recommendations is that, when tracking mobile viewability, publishers and advertisers shouldn\u2019t start counting ads as being viewable until they are fully rendered. And given mobile\u2019s ad-rendering lag time, some publishers and advertisers may be overestimating how many mobile ads they are delivering, if they are starting the clock before ads are fully loaded.\n\nIn other words, \u201cyou might be counting wrong,\u201d said Mr. Ivie.\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "MRC Says Mobile Ads Take Too Long to Load"}

It plans to challenge Google, Nielsen, comScore and other digital media companies by developing a standard metric that would serve as the currency for buying and selling digital ads.\n\nFounded in 2010, Moat is perhaps best known for being one of the leading companies that track viewability\u2014determining whether online ads can be seen by real people. But the 125-person company, which had previously raised over $17 million, aspires to do much more. According to co-founder and Chief Executive Jonah Goodhart, Moat is working on a new measurement designed to help Web advertisers and publishers gauge whether people pay attention to digital ads and are impacted by them.\n\nThe investment round was led by Insight Venture Partners.\n\nThe ultimate goal for Moat will be to have advertisers negotiate ad deals using this new metric, rather than relying on the long-standing practice of billing advertisers based on how many ads are delivered to a Web page by \u201cad serving\u201d software.\n\nTypically, ad serving data comes from Google\u2014the leading ad serving provider in the industry. That data is often used by media companies to track how many ads they deliver and to bill advertisers. In addition, advertisers often use tools from comScore and Nielsen to enhance ad serving data, such as tracking the demographic makeup of the audience that is exposed to an ad campaign.\n\nBut as more digital advertising moves away from standard banners on Web pages toward video and native ads on platforms like YouTube, Snapchat and Facebook, Moat sees an opportunity to displace Google and other metrics providers.\n\nMr. Goodhart said Moat is already well positioned to do this, since it has its own viewability tracking mechanisms plugged into Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Plus, a major advertiser, Unilever, is already transacting ad deals using Moat data.\n\n\u201cOur ambition is to build the currency for digital advertising,\u201d he said, while emphasizing that Moat sees companies like Nielsen and Google as potential partners in this effort.\n\nMoat has successfully pivoted before. The company first launched with the idea of building a crowdsourcing tool for online ad creative, which never took off. Over time, the Moat team built a search engine for online ads, then started selling access to advanced analytics to marketers.\n\nIn the past few years, as the online ad industry rushed to start only buying ads that are viewable, Moat was in the right place at the right time and moved aggressively to build out viewability tracking tools for both desktops and mobile Web pages.\n\nWhile he declined to discuss specific figures, Mr. Goodhart said that Moat has been profitable for the past two years and that revenue tripled from 2014 to 2015.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I wrote down when we started this company five years ago was, we need to make brand advertising more effective online,\u201d said Mr. Goodhart. He and his Moat partners Noah Goodhart and Michael Walrath had previously partnered to create Right Media, an early digital ad exchange that was heavily used by direct-response advertisers. It was sold to Yahoo in 2007.\n\nWith Moat, the plan was to cater more to the kinds of marketers who spent heavily on TV, like car, beer and toothpaste brands. \u201cMost stuff is bought offline,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to connect those dots. If you look at TV, it has a currency [with Nielsen data]. It may be flawed, but the point is, everyone is on the same page.\u201d\n\nSurely, most every digital media company would like to see more TV ad budgets come their way. But getting everyone on the same page for a brand new currency won\u2019t be easy. Just getting viewability standards set across the industry has been challenging.\n\nPeter Naylor, head of sales for Hulu, said he started working with Moat a few years ago when brands started pushing the viewability concept. That move led to more ad budgets coming Hulu\u2019s way, he said.\n\nSo he\u2019s impressed with Moat\u2019s technology and approach. \u201cThey are really in touch with the needs of both sides of the business,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an opening there. But [ad] server counting is pretty foundationally sound in the industry.\u201d\n\nMegan Pagliuca, global chief executive at Accuen, an agency that specializes in data-driven ad buying, said she\u2019s generally on board with Moat\u2019s philosophy. \u201cI do think the industry needs to evolve beyond the metrics we have today,\u201d she said. \u201cAd serving data is clearly not enough.\u201d\n\nBut Ms. Pagliuca said it may be hard for any one company to solve all of the digital ad world\u2019s needs. For example, besides tracking whether ads are viewable or command attention, advertisers are looking for help in tracking people across different devices and different media vehicles, she said.\n\nFor now, Moat is focused on building out its technology aimed at developing this potential new ad currency, as well as hiring. The plan is to double staff this year, Mr. Goodhart said. \u201cWe think we are at an interesting crossroads in the industry,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere Marketers are saying, \u2018if I can\u2019t measure it, I can\u2019t buy it.\u2019\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Moat Raises $50 Million to Help Develop Digital Ad Currency"}

And Web publishers and advertisers alike better start clearly labeling content paid for by marketers as \u201cadvertising.\u201d\n\nThose messages were delivered by a gentle scolding from FTC Commissioner Julie Brill, who spoke at an AdExchanger conference in New York on Thursday. Ms. Brill started off joking about how the some of the advertising issues that the FTC focuses on had broken out in pop culture, noting references to native advertising in HBO\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight With John Oliver\u201d and ad blocking on \u201cSouth Park.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on fleek,\u201d she cracked.\n\nBut Ms. Brill\u2019s tone shifted quickly, as she talked about how the organization has been conducting research on the growth of advertisers and publishers targeting the same person across their laptop, phone and tablet\u2014and doesn\u2019t like what it is finding.\n\nSpecifically, the FTC recently looked at the top 20 websites in five different content categories, Ms. Brill said, and found that many of these sites were employing some sort of cross-device tracking mechanism. But few were disclosing that they were doing so. Even worse, few of these sites made it easy for people to opt out of said tracking\u2014something Ms. Brill said she found \u201ctroubling.\u201d\n\nCross-device targeting \u201cis harder to detect and harder for consumers to control,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear consumers are meaningfully informed about cross-device tracking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ad tech industry\u2014you\u2014should be mindful that the Federal Trade Commission has pushed for more consumer control over third-party data for at least 15 years,\u201d Ms. Brill said. \u201cAnd yet, here we are in 2016, and consumers still do not have adequate means to opt out of data collection.\u201d\n\nAs a result, some consumers are avoiding digital ads altogether by employing ad blockers. And Ms. Brill wasn\u2019t all that subtle in identifying who was to blame for that phenomenon: the ad tech industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really somewhat surprising to me that the ad tech industry hasn\u2019t been more motivated to offer consumers better tools to protect their privacy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been the case that consumers could take matters into their own hands. And that is what precisely appears to be happening.\u201d\n\nAs a remedy, Ms. Brill urged advertisers to opt to deliver ads to customers using less data, arguing that is better than not being able to deliver ads at all.\n\nOf course, many publishers and advertisers see native ads as a way around ad blocking and the overall overabundance of digital ad targeting. But Ms. Brill also warned against abuses in this realm. She pointed to the guidelines the FTC released last month as it seeks to make sure consumers aren\u2019t being misled by such native ads.\n\nMs. Brill summed that document up as follows: \u201cNo matter the media or format, advertising messages should be easily identifiable to consumers as advertising.\u201d And that\u2019s not always the case today, she said. Some publishers and advertisers take effort to hide labels indicating that sponsored content is paid for by a brands, making people click or hover over these messages to find out.\n\nNative ads \u201ccannot function as a workaround that tricks consumers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest to ensure that consumers understand\u201d that advertisers are the ones paying for sponsored content. Such transparency is \u201ckey to preserving consumer trust.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "FTC Commissioner Urges Ad Industry to Let Consumers Opt Out of Tracking"}
{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftc-issues-guidelines-for-native-ads-1450816408", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": ") Photo: Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission issued guidelines on Tuesday for so-called native advertising, which are ads designed to mimic a website\u2019s editorial look and feel, as it seeks to make sure that consumers aren't being misled.\n\nOver the past few years, publishers have aggressively embraced the practice, also called \u201csponsored content,\u201d as they have sought new ad formats that consumers are more likely to see and engage with than ad types such as banner ads, which people have become experts at ignoring and avoiding.\n\nPublishers from Web startups like BuzzFeed to major newspapers including The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times now publish native ads or sponsored articles that relate to the products and services of advertisers.\n\nThe regulatory body said today \u201cregardless of the medium in which an advertising or promotional message is disseminated, deception occurs when consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances are misled about its nature or source, and such misleading impression is likely to affect their decisions or conduct regarding the advertised product or the advertising.\u201d\n\nThe FTC also issued an 11-page guide for businesses that can help them comply with FTC policy on native ads. It included lengthy and detailed hypothetical examples and what disclosures would be required.\n\nThe FTC gave examples of how to make \u201cclear and prominent\u201ddisclosures in native ads and said that \u201cdisclosures must be understandable.\u201d\n\nTerms that are likely understood by consumers include \u201cAd\u201d and \u201cSponsored Advertising Content,\u201d the regulatory body said. It added that advertisers should not use terms such as \u201cPromoted\u201d or \u201cPromoted Stories,\u201d which are \u201cat best ambiguous and potentially could mislead consumers that advertising content is endorsed by a publisher site.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FTC has put a lot of teeth into the guidelines\u201d and they are \u201cvery specific in nature,\u201d said Linda Goldstein, partner at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips. Ms. Goldstein point outs that there are several guidelines that advertisers and publisher should note, such as a disclosure should be in proximity to the headline on the native ad. She said that guideline is particularly noteworthy because it\u2019s very \u201cspecific\u201d and not what is \u201ccustomarily done today.\u201d\n\nAnother guideline suggests that if consumers are going to click on a link and be taken to a native ad, they need to be told before they click that they will be taken to an ad.\n\n\u201cIn 2016, we will begin to see cases brought in the native advertising area,\u201d added Ms. Goldstein. \u201cI believe the FTC will use selective cases to put more meat around these guidelines.\u201d\n\nThe FTC has been looking into this type of advertising for some time. In 2013, it hosted informal workshops for advertises, publishers and legal experts that was entitled: \u201cBlurred Lines: Advertising or Content.\u201d The meetings included discussion about whether media outlets were adequately identifying sponsored stories on their websites as promotional content and if the practice of native advertising misleads consumers.\n\nNative ad spending in the U.S. is expected to grow 34% in 2015 to reach $4.3 billion, according to ad-tracker eMarketer, which cited data from research firm Socintel360.\n\nThere is little sign that native advertising is losing steam. Experts say that the rise of ad-blocking software is also adding more fuel to the growth of marketing technique. Moreover, many believe that sponsored stories are more likely to be shared on social media outlets such as Facebook and Twitter, which helps marketers generate more interest and buzz for their products.\n\nFor publishers, native ads also attractive because they often command a hefty premium over other types of online ads.\n\nWrite to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "FTC Issues Guidelines for Native Ads"}

A host of publishers rely on advertising, from banners to videos to sponsored content, to support their businesses, and the market is crowded.\n\n\u201dVox Media\u2019s audience of 170 million is affluent and already highly interested in transacting on our platform, so we are exploring opportunities to deliver more value to them,\u201d a spokeswoman for Vox said.\n\nIn Dec. Gawker founder and Chief Executive Nick Denton told the WSJ that in 2014 Gawker\u2019s e-commerce business generated $150 million in sales, and about $10 million of revenue for Gawker -- just under a quarter of the company\u2019s $44.3 million total revenue.\n\nE-commerce posts generally link to products that readers of the site would be interested in, and publishers are paid a commission for sales generated from those links. In a since-deleted tweet, Shane Roberts, Gawker Media\u2019s director of commerce, said the company\u2019s typically receives a 4% commission.\n\nGawker\u2019s commerce posts, typically linking to Amazon.com, list disclaimers at the bottom indicating \u201cGawker Media may get a commission.\u201d Business Insider places a similar disclosure at the top of posts from its \u201cInsider Picks\u201d staff.\n\nAmazon\u2019s commission schedule ranges from 1% to 10% depending on the product type and the quantity sold.\n\nJulie Hansen, president and chief operating officer at Business Insider, said readers have had a positive reaction to its e-commerce posts, in part because of its prominent disclosure and because the \u201cInsider Picks\u201d staff remains separate from the editorial staff members.\n\n\u201cWhen we do it well we\u2019re really adding value to our readers,\u201d Ms. Hansen said. \u201cWe\u2019re helping them find the products they need, and if we can make money while helping them find what they need, then that\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nMs. Hansen likened these posts to how golf magazines would test and review equipment to help inform readers.\n\n\u201cThe difference is now you can do it on the Web, and they can make that decision and they\u2019re only a click away,\u201d she said.\n\nNews media companies are not the only ones looking to convert users into commerce customers. Pinterest, a social media site commonly used to bookmark pictures of fashion, DIY projects and recipes, in June rolled out an option to allow users to buy certain products directly through the site.\n\nPinterest has said it does not take a commission on these \u201cbuyable pins,\u201d but does sell \u201cpromoted pins\u201d targeted to particular users.", "date": null, "title": "Vox to Join Other Media Companies in E-Commerce Push"}

But Gawker is increasingly pumping resources into affiliate marketing efforts.\n\nAccording to Chief Executive Nick Denton, the company helped drive around $150 million worth of e-commerce transactions this year. Gawker takes a cut of those sales. In 2014, the company generated around $10 million in e-commerce revenue for itself, Mr. Denton said in an email, adding that he expects the number to be \u201cquite a bit\u201d higher for 2015.\n\nGawker, like other media companies, has been on the hunt for new ways to make money as it becomes harder to generate revenue from display advertising.\n\nThe company, whose stable of sites includes Deadspin, Gizmodo, Jezebel and its namesake title, isn\u2019t shy about using the tactic. On Wednesday, the editorial staff of Gawker.com published a post about the \u201cbest things we bought in 2015,\u201d highlighting items like a trash can, a water resistant shower speaker and two vacuums, with links to purchase those products. \u201cGawker Media may get a commission,\u201d multiple disclaimers say at the bottom of the post.\n\nPhoto: Gawker\n\nA look at some of the most popular products purchased via Amazon gives a rough idea of how sales are going. Some 20,667 readers, for example, have purchased an Anker external battery charger, according to an Amazon widget on the Gawker site. Given its current price of $89.99, that would be about $1.8 million in total, though the price may have varied over time.\n\nHow much of that might Gawker take home? The commission rate on Amazon varies based on product and quantity. When asked by a reporter on Twitter, Shane Roberts, Gawker Media\u2019s director of commerce, said in a tweet that the company\u2019s \u201cnormal commission rate is 4%.\u201d That could give Gawker about $74,000 in revenue for shepherding sales of the Anker charger. Mr. Roberts\u2019 tweet was later removed.\n\nAs for the Velcro ties, 31,535 readers have purchased a 100-pack on Amazon, which currently run for $4.99. That\u2019s $157,000 in cable ties, which could add $6,300 into Gawker\u2019s coffers, assuming a 4% cut.\n\nAll told, the 10 best-selling items from a Gawker list posted in September might have brought in about $345,000 in revenue for the media company. To be sure, prices may have changed, and Gawker could receive a better rate than 4% on some items, so that revenue figure is potentially higher.\n\nAffiliate marketing of this variety is nothing new. It\u2019s been a popular tactic for e-commerce and direct-response marketers for over a decade. But as online publishers look for new revenue streams beyond display ads, the practice could see something of a resurgence.\n\nAccording to Mr. Denton, audiences for sites such as Gizmodo and Lifehacker show a higher propensity to purchase than those of other sites.\n\n\u201cProduct recommendations don\u2019t work for everyone, but if you\u2019ve got brands associated with key product categories, an affluent audience and the right kind of context and credibility, it\u2019s a valuable second revenue stream,\u201d he said.\n\nGawker Media, a private company that does not typically release financials, earlier this year opened its books to some extent amid a legal battle with professional wrestler Hulk Hogan. The company said it turned an operating profit of $6.5 million on revenue of $44.3 million in 2014.\n\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com and Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "How Gawker Brings In Millions Selling Headphones, Chargers and Flashlights"}

Is it a copy, a reproduction, a postproduction, a counterfeit, a reincarnated artifact? The Jaguar Heritage department, they who built the car, calls it a \u201ccontinuation\u201d model, as if all those blokes on the line had been taking a tea break for 60 years. The Federation Internationale de l\u2019Automobile (FIA), the world body governing motorsports, will regard the six cars as \u201cperiod competition vehicles\u201d fully qualified for historic racing, which seems a delightful bit of self-deception.\n\nA point of track etiquette: If a driver of one of the 11 remaining LWE\u2019s\u2014one of which just sold at auction for more than \u00a35 million (about $7.5 million)\u2014and a driver of a new LWE (\u00a31 million or so, depending on trim) both dive for the same corner in a historic-car race, which driver yields? Maybe they just let the insurance agents fight it out in the paddock?\n\nJaguar Lightweight E-Type Jaguar Lightweight E-Type Jaguar \u2026 Jaguar Lightweight E-Type Jaguar \u2026 Jaguar Lightweight E-Type Jaguar \u2026 Jaguar Lightweight E-Type Jaguar \u2026 Jaguar Lightweight E-Type Jaguar \u2026 Jaguar Lightweight E-Type Jaguar \u2026 Jaguar Lightweight E-Type Jaguar \u2026 Jaguar Lightweight E-Type Jaguar \u2026 Jaguar Lightweight E-Type Jaguar \u2026 Jaguar Lightweight E-Type Jaguar \u2026 Jaguar Lightweight E-Type Jaguar \u2026 Jaguar Lightweight E-Type Jaguar \u2026 Jaguar Lightweight E-Type Jaguar \u2026 Jaguar Lightweight E-Type Jaguar \u2026 of SHOW CAPTION HIDE CAPTION of\n\nThe LWE starts with the E-Type\u2019s concupiscent silhouette, the four-wheeled torpedo designed by aerodynamicist Malcolm Sayer as an evolution of the Le Mans-winning D-Type. Enzo Ferrari famously called the E-Type the most beautiful car in the world, and the charge still sticks. But unlike the steel-bodied road cars, the LWE\u2019s structure and skin are fashioned of more than 200 stamped, welded and riveted aluminum pieces, saving 250 pounds. LWE project leader Kev Riches said while it would have been easy to improve the structure and stiffness of the car with modern construction adhesives and stronger alloys, they resisted in the name of period fidelity (and FIA approval).\n\nHowever, the team did avail themselves of digital capture of a reference LWE\u2019s inner and outer panels in order to make the tooling. As Jag enthusiasts know, the original cars were not perfectly symmetrical; some days more so than others. In order to assure symmetry, the team scanned one side of the car and then made a digital mirror image for the other half.\n\nJaguar Lightweight E-Type JURRASIC WORLD | Much like Hollywood\u2019s regeneration of dinosaurs, Jaguar has brought this 1964 racer back to life. Photo: Jaguar Price, as tested: \u00a31 million Powertrain: Naturally aspirated 3,868-cc DOHC in-line six cylinder, aluminum block with steel sleeves, with Triple Weber 45 carburetors or mechanical fuel-injection (optional) and dry-sump lubrication; 4-speed fully synchronized close-ratio gearbox; rear-wheel drive, with Power-Lok limited-slip and 3.31:1 axle ratio. Horsepower/torque: 340 hp at 6,500 rpm/280 lb-ft at 4,500 rpm Length/weight: 175.3 inches/2,204.6 pounds Wheelbase: 96.1 inches 0-60 mph: 6 seconds (est.) Top speed: 170 mph (est.)\n\nUnder the 42-louver hood\u2014which tips forward on hinges so that the handcrafted aluminum nose rests precariously on the asphalt\u2014we find the newly made and correct 3.8-liter in-line six with aluminum block and heads with steel sleeves, as well as the six horizontal intake trumpets polished like band instruments. Other old friends are there: the polished cam covers, the dulled aluminum dry sump, like the Tin Man\u2019s torso.\n\nThis engine, with dual chain-driven cams and hemispherical combustion chambers running a 10.0:1 compression ratio, produces a squalling, bawling 340 hp at 6,000 rpm and 280 pound-feet of torque at 4,500 rpm. In other words, all the power is up top, so if you are going to drive the LWE properly you have to be willing to romp it.\n\nJaguar gave the cars\u2019 six client-collectors a choice of Triple Weber 45 carburetors or a racier, more temperamental Lucas mechanical fuel-injection system. I drove both the carbureted prototype and a customer\u2019s fuel-injected model, and I much preferred the triple Webers, which didn\u2019t balk as much as the fuelie.\n\nAs befitting a competition car, the LWE\u2019s bumpers have been stripped off. An aluminum hardtop is standard. Creature comforts are minimal: plastic windows and backlight; a cable-release to open the doors from the inside; and two lightly padded bucket seats with five-point harnesses, as well as the FIA-mandated roll cage. Other sine qua non details of the LWE, such as the leather hood straps, the plated rear-deck latch, the magnesium knockoff wheels, and the air extractors at the back of the hood, roof and rear deck lid, are all present and perfect.\n\nFor anyone accustomed to the gleaming infallibility of modern performance cars, the LWE will feel as raw as a crop duster. You turn the key, flip on the fuel pump, put on some choke and press the Start button. The engine saws without fire for a second then lights with a blatty harrumph, before settling into a steady, lean idle as you push in the choke.\n\nWith its lightweight flywheel and short-uptake clutch, the LWE needs care, and plenty of revs, to move off smoothly. As I round a 90-degree turn at Circuito de Navarra, ahead of the main straight in second gear, I reach for power. It\u2019s like pushing up the throttles behind the blasting, blaring prop of a vintage warbird.\n\nThe LWE\u2019s footwell is narrow and the pedals small and close together. Downshifting and double clutching is like tap-dancing in a bucket. Approaching the end of the track\u2019s half-mile straight I\u2019m battling to get the car slowed and stabilized whilst not zinging the valves of somebody else\u2019s million-quid E-Type. The task has my full attention. In fact, in terms of cognitive load the LWE draws more power than just about any car I\u2019ve driven lately.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that is the point.\n\nThe LWE is nothing less than an indictment of modern supercars and their diminishing returns of driving pleasure. The new Ferrari 488 GTB, for example, is startlingly quick and absurdly easy to drive around the Fiorano Circuit. Losing control of the car seems almost unthinkable. But soon habituation takes over, lap times level out, and you are pretty much hanging out at the limits of the car.\n\nThe LWE is an entirely different affair and more challenging. There\u2019s no electronic safety net to keep you from looping the car under power or flat-spotting the front tires by locking the brakes. You rely on your own resources as a driver, such as they are. It\u2019s a hell of a lot of fun. Life-affirming, even.\n\nAs extraordinary as my hourlong lapping session with the LWE has been, the Jaguar people hint at more to come. They don\u2019t get specific, but I can guess. In 1957, for example, a fire broke out in the Browns Lane factory, destroying nine of 26 highly desirable XKSSs, which were D-Type racers converted to road specification. Steve McQueen had one. Those nine VIN numbers are available should Jaguar Heritage want to re-create the lost cars, as they have with the LWE.\n\nMr. Riches smiled when I asked him about future historic recreations. \u201cWe have lots of extra numbers.\u201d", "date": null, "title": "Jaguar Brings the 1964 E-Type Racer Back to Life"}

During this eight-day tour of Europe I\u2019ve practically left a contrail, thousands of pounds of CO2 cast merrily upon the wind: Five airplanes, five hotels, one TGV and many fast cars. That\u2019s not even counting the towels.\n\nAnd now I am striding upon the autobahn between Bavaria and Saxony in a twin-turbo BMW M6 Coupe, cruising in splendid isolation at 135 kmh, or so, with the occasional effortless reach to 275 kmh (170 mph).\n\nStretches of unrestricted autobahn are getting rare, and speed cameras maintain robotic discipline the rest of the way. I\u2019ve only had a couple of occasions to floor it but then, wow, it\u2019s one big gravity flush.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed the M6, with its proud array of LED headlamps and bird-of-prey visage, is so distinctive at a distance that German drivers almost reflexively yield the left lane to it. This thing moves through a crowd like an off-duty detective.\n\nWSJ\u2019s Dan Neil joins Lunch Break with Tanya Rivero to discuss his recent ride along Germany\u2019s Autobahn in a twin-turbo BMW M6. Photo: Dan Neil\n\nWhile the official paperwork indicates an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph (250 km/h) on the M6, my car\u2019s speed limiter is disabled. Apparently that is part of the M Driver\u2019s package. In any event, I approve. Germany is particularly blurry this time of year, don\u2019t you think?\n\nThe package also includes the option of our mesmerizing 20-inch light-alloy wheels and indecently thin Michelins (295/30s on the rear). My test car has the carbon-ceramic brake package, so I\u2019m sporting some significantly lowered unsprung mass. This thing tracks gorgeously. No big car is more blithely stable at sustained high speed.\n\nThe giant wind turbines along the route mock me, but the work has to go on. High-speed, internodal transit from one German city to another is the M6\u2019s primary mission, its brief, its raison d\u2019\u00eatre. It\u2019s MUC-to-LEJ at a cruising altitude of zero feet.\n\nI want it known, before I fall all over myself in love with the M6, that there is yet a better way to accomplish this particular effect\u2014electric. All of the remarkable qualities that this car brings to the table\u2014its mastery of noise, vibration and powertrain isolation; its spine-tingling acceleration; its hyper-athletic modernity\u2014could be delivered with less mechanical overhead with an electric powertrain.\n\nThe designers of the M6 struggled to achieve the quiet and accelerative linearity that are an EV\u2019s birthrights. Energy storage? During a four-hour bash of the German countryside, I stopped for a loo and a coffee. I could have availed myself of any number of available superchargers along the corridor of that autobahn. I don\u2019t think I could drive a Tesla Model S P85D hard enough to exhaust the batteries in that scenario.\n\nFurther, the Tesla represents only the beginning of this EV energy storage technology, whereas the M6 represents the end-times of internal combustion.\n\nActually, if I had the M6\u2019s as-tested, all-in price of $171,590, and I needed a swank German GT, I think I might opt for the company\u2019s i8, a carbon-fiber future coupe with swan-wing doors and gas-electric powertrain. She\u2019s a cool one.\n\nBut there is an asterisk: The i8 and the Tesla aren\u2019t geared for flights over 155 mph. If you want a car that fast that only feels electric, you want the M6.\n\n2015 BMW M6 BMW M6 Coupe Photo: BMW Base price: $126,600 Price, as tested: $171,590 Powertrain: turbocharged direct-injection 4.4-liter DOHC, 32-valve V8 with variable geometry twin-scroll turbos and throttleless intake; seven-speed dual clutch transmission; rear-wheel drive with active differential Horsepower/torque: 600 hp at 6,000-7,000 rpm; 501 lb-ft at 1,500-6,000 rpm (Competition package) Length/weight: 193.0 inches/4,515 pounds Wheelbase: 112.2 inches EPA fuel economy: 16/31/23.7 mpg (direct conversion from metric EU cycle testing and not EPA) Luggage capacity: 11 cubic feet\n\nTo tee it up a bit: The M6 is BMW\u2019s flagship coupe, five-meter class, with the all the dynamics and performance taps opened. It starts with the 6 series, a front-engine, rear-drive grand touring car, steel and aluminum construction, with 2+2 seating and a trunk of useful size.\n\nThe 6 comes in three body styles: the two-door closed coupe\u2014what a gentleman orders; convertible; or the four-door Gran Coupe, built over a wheelbase 4.5-inches longer than that of the coupe/convertible (112.2 inches). I don\u2019t much care for that.\n\nThe 640i carries a 3.0 twin-turbo V6 (315 hp) while the 650i carries a 4.4-liter V8 (445 hp). The M6\u2014the product of the savant-deviants of BMW Motorsport division\u2014gets a radically improved turbo 4.4-liter V8. This is the fully blueprinted, forged-everything edition, producing 560 hp from 6,000-7,000 rpm (600 hp in Competition Package-equipped cars) and 501 pound-feet of torque from 1,500 to 5,750 rpm (6,000 rpm in Competition package). Crosshead manifolds, low-inertia variable geometry twin-scroll turbos, full articulation on intake and exhaust valves.\n\nThe turbos modulate the engine\u2019s respiration so well it doesn\u2019t even need to throttle bodies anymore. By the time all that chat goes through the optional seven-speed dual-clutch M gearbox, lickety-split, and appears at the back wheels, you are really moving\u2026as if in a beautiful, expensive dream.\n\nEverything in the M6 is dialed up and cinched down: the adaptive damper control gets an extra edge in the Competition cars. In Dynamic mode, the steering is heavy and twitchy. The front double-wishbone suspension has special M specific elastokinematics, specifically a negative steering roll radius, helping to make the car a little more friendly at the limits. The five-link rear likewise gets special elastics and geometry. Whatever. It sticks.\n\nThis is, as the kids would say, totes amaze-balls, and it\u2019s the endless gifting of torque combined with the virtually imperceptible and nearly instant gear changes that creates the kinetic echo of an electric car.\n\nOne doesn\u2019t have to read between the lines very far to get that BMW, like all European luxury auto makers, is feeling the pressure to explain itself. The M6\u2019s media release says the car\u2019s fuel economy\u201428.5 mpg, average\u2014in the first sentence, like a salesman getting his foot in the door.\n\nWait, what? Let\u2019s stipulate that figure doesn\u2019t represent real-world results (not the way I\u2019m driving) but anything like an official 28.5 average mpg is a towering number for a 4,515-pound capable of 600 hp. BMW would no doubt point out the car\u2019s intriguing fuel-saving strategies: stop-start; on-demand auxiliaries; brake energy regeneration; reduced-rolling resistance tires. Never has virtue been so cunningly cloaked in vice.\n\nWhile exploring the last frontiers of IC-engine refinement, our M6 also touched the top of the option mountain too, including those carbon-ceramic stoppers with six-pot front calipers; adaptive LED headlamps with high-beam assist; a full suite of connectivity, from the vehicle\u2019s ConnectedDrive to Internet hot spot; optional Bang & Olufsen surround-sound audio; and head-up display. The saddlery is impeccable, the instrumentation handsome to touch and rational, like hi-end audio equipment.\n\nI still feel guilty. Electric would be better.

Until then, every curve felt like one of those corporate trust-building exercises where I was falling backward in hopes someone would catch me.\n\nThe Spyder (the F3-S is the power-cruiser version in upscale trim) is a snowmobile for the road: saddle seat; high-strength steel frame; high-revving, 115-hp Rotax 1.3-liter three-cylinder engine; carlike brake pedal at the right foot; handlebar-style steering with throttle in the right grip. The Canadian giant BRP has sold more than 100,000 of them since 2008, despite the evident fact that the vehicle has only three wheels.\n\nStep on the foot peg and swing your leg over the trike to land on the molded-suede saddle, a rakish 26.6 inches high. The Spyder obliges the rider to assume a wide stance in the seated position, an ATV-like posture. The twist-grip throttle control is in the usual place, but there\u2019s no right-hand brake lever. Our tester featured the optional six-speed sequential gearbox and a toggle-style shifter under the left-control cluster.\n\nIn one of many corners where legal liability seems to have taken a hand in design, the shift lever under the left cluster works by pressing the lever forward to upshift, and pulling back to downshift, rather than the proper way around as in a race car. This makes it hard to accidentally upshift under power and lose control.\n\n2015 Can-Am Spyder F3-S Photo: Dan Neil/The Wall Street Journal Base price: $19,499 As tested: $22,499 Powertrain: Liquid-cooled 1330-cc in-line three-cylinder engine with electronic fuel injection and throttle control; six-speed sequential gearbox with Reverse; rear-wheel drive. Horsepower/torque: 115 hp at 7,250 rpm/96 pound-feet at 5,000 rpm Length/weight: 104 inches/850 lbs Seat height: 26.6 inches Wheelbase: 67.3 inches 0-60 mph: 4.5 seconds (est) Fuel economy: 35-40 mpg average (company); 252-mile range Cargo capacity: 7.1 gallons\n\nTo engage reverse it\u2019s necessary to hold the shift lever back while pressing a large red \u201cR\u201d button on top of the left control array, typically with the right hand, though the maneuver can be done with the left hand alone. And then the thing starts beeping in warning. Don\u2019t mind me, I\u2019m just a mall cop from the near future.\n\nYou know what\u2019s fun? Compare the Morgan 3 Wheeler\u2014delicate antiquarian contraption\u2014with the Power Ranger that is the Can-Am: the wasp-like tail of the rear wheel and single swingarm; the riprap of black bars underneath and the exposed orneriness of the Rotax crankcase cover; the fantasia of bodywork.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to embrace the Can-Am lifestyle, shouldn\u2019t you be doing other things in ultramodern ways, like having your cereal delivered by pneumatic tube or putting solar panels on your cat?\n\nCan-Am\u2019s media contact was keen for me to come to grips with the machine\u2019s unique handling. And grip I did. Because the Can-Am has three wheels, it doesn\u2019t lean as it takes a curve, like a bike, but arcs as flatly as the suspension stiffness (double wishbones, Fox coilovers, antiroll bar) will allow against a given roll energy. But do try to avoid using up your suspension travel; the Can-Am\u2019s front end can get quite busy if it crosses uneven pavement midcorner.\n\nThis machine\u2019s weirdness has several parts. One is the unfamiliar lateral pull one feels in the motorcycle-like saddle; as compared with a leaning bike, where centrifugal force holds the rider securely, the Can-Am feels like it wants to unseat you.\n\nAs a result, the Can-Am requires a kind of yoga to ride. While the trike doesn\u2019t lean, the rider needs to stay busy moving his or her weight around to compensate for cornering loads, just as on an ATV. If the rider remains planted in the saddle the Can-Am has fairly modest thresholds of cornering and road holding.\n\nThe other bit of advice the company offered: stay loose. That is, try not to impart too much chassis movement to the handlebars through your arms. Eventually, I released my death grip and the Can-Am calmed down and tracked better.\n\nThe Spyder\u2019s unorthodoxy is crystallized in that moment of initial turn-in, the second or so between steering input and fully executed chassis response and weight transfer. Can-Am calls the system Dynamic Power Steering, the goal of which, I assume, is to lower steering response at higher speeds lest riders snap-roll into the clover.\n\nSteering heft, ratio and response has been an evolving science with the Can-Am Spyder. In 2009 the company recalled the first generation of trikes to fix an allegedly sluggish steering response that could consequently cause riders to overcorrect. The steering of the Spyder I rode was linear and crisp at cruising speeds and below. But things quickly get fascinating at sport-riding pace.\n\nThe one thing the Spyder really doesn\u2019t like is trail braking. Turn while under hard braking and the Spyder gets spooky and it\u2019s then you really feel the 67.3-inch wheelbase.\n\nThe Can-Am Spyder is protected by electronic angels, collaborating stability, traction and braking systems engineered by Bosch. Notably, the 2015 edition of the vehicle stability system (VSS) invokes brake-based intervention first to keep all three wheels on the ground; VSS will cut the engine only if it continues to sense conditions of an incipient rollover. But Can-Am would like to remind all riders: If you are determined to lift a front wheel off the ground you absolutely can. So don\u2019t.\n\nThe parameters of the stability-control system are written to assure large margins of safety. But they also step in to forbid the performing of doughnuts with full steering lock and a smoking, spinning rear tire in the driveway of your least favorite neighbor. Obviously a huge design flaw to be addressed in future models.\n\nSo, color me surprised. You can\u2019t go as hard on a Can-Am Spyder as you might with a 1300-cc sport bike, but it doesn\u2019t lack for a strange, dorky kind of adrenaline. One is never bored.\n\nWrite to Dan Neil at Dan.Neil@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Can-Am Spyder F3-S: A Strange (but Not Dull) Ride"}

This behavior is contributing to how slowly some Web pages are loading, encouraging the growing use of ad-blocking software among consumers, they argue.\n\nAs the industry has wrestled with who is to blame for the growth of ad blocking, \u201cgreedy\u201d Web publishers and \u201cmoney-grabbing\u201d ad tech companies have largely emerged as the villains responsible for bogging down the user experience. But among publishers, there\u2019s a growing sentiment that ad agencies are as much at fault as they try to create ads that cater to clients\u2019 long lists of demands.\n\n\u201cWe are at a crossroads,\u201d said Tim Mahlman, AOL\u2019s president of publisher platforms. \u201cPeople are pointing the finger back at us, yet the advertisers are [always] wanting to push the envelope on creative. There has to be a common ground. Can we do killer ads not at the cost of turning people away?\u201d\n\nMr. Mahlman points to a central conflict facing the online ad world: On the one side, the digital media business has spent the past several years trying to attract more TV advertisers by proving itself as a viable vehicle for image-oriented branding, rather than serving primarily as a venue for marketers looking to sell products directly.\n\nThat\u2019s led the industry to push for big, in-your face ad units, which take over Web pages and are loaded with interactivity.\n\nPlus, the ad world has become fixated on only running ad that are \u201cviewable.\u201d And ads that score high for viewability are often the largest.\n\nIn addition, marketers have pushed to track every possible metric, since that is considered digital media\u2019s strength. That has meant stuffing ads with trackers to gauge how viewable they are and whether they are running in the right places, reaching real people and targeting preferred demographics.\n\nAll of this combines to create fat ads. These are exactly the kind of ads that don\u2019t work well in mobile, a medium where digital media companies are trying to speed loading times and avoid overtaxing consumers\u2019 mobile data plans.\n\nSome publishers say there\u2019s a pervasive attitude regarding who should tackle these issues and who should not. \u201cAgencies look at this as not their problem,\u201d said an ad sales executive.\n\nBut take Forbes, for instance, which\u2014like many publishers\u2014provides its ad partners with guidelines for the kinds of ads that it accepts. Those specs typically include preferred maximum file sizes.\n\nYet according to Chief Revenue Officer Mark Howard, agencies will frequently supply Forbes with ads that are four to nine times larger than Forbes\u2019 specs. Other publishers say they see the same kind of pattern.\n\nBesides ignoring those guidelines, agencies will often send the ad information late, even if sites require that creative gets delivered three days before the start of a campaign, publishers say.\n\nWhy don\u2019t publishers like Forbes just say no?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to turn down revenue when the wider Web isn\u2019t following any of the rules,\u201d said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, a digital publishing trade association.\n\nSo, why aren\u2019t agencies all following the rules? Harry Kargman, chief executive at the mobile ad firm Kargo, says that agencies are often in an impossible spot. Before a campaign, they often need to secure multiple executive approvals both internally and from their clients. And clients are always pushing for more.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s best for their client isn\u2019t necessarily best for the consumer,\u201d he said. For example, Mr. Kargman wants to get advertisers to stop running full-screen mobile \u201cinterstitial\u201d ads, which consumers dislike intensely. But marketers keep pushing their agencies to buy them.\n\nAnd marketers are known for making decisions at the 11th hour. Publishers are left with the choice of pushing back\u2014and maybe losing business. Mr. Kargman said half of the campaigns his company ran during the first quarter of this year were delayed.\n\n\u201cBrands and agencies are well aware of page load times, ad blocking, etc., but take zero responsibility for it at a campaign level,\u201d he said.\n\nGaston Legorburu, chief creative strategist at Publicis. Sapient, acknowledged that agencies and clients need to get better about these practices. \u201cThere is a lack of maturity,\u201d he said, particularly among marketers who are relatively new to the Web.\n\nHe has had advertisers try to stuff the functionality of entire websites\u2014like car configurators\u2014into single banner ads. \u201cThat\u2019s just annoying to consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to invite people in.\u201d\n\nThe Interactive Advertising Bureau is examining this issue as part of an initiative announced last year called LEAN (Light, Encrypted, Ad choice supported, Non-invasive ads). It hopes to establish a set of standards and guidelines for streamlining ads. Alanna Gombert, deputy general manager of the IAB Tech Lab, said that the movement is still in its research and experimentation stage.\n\nHowever, even as various factions of the business advocate that digital ads go on a diet, not everyone agrees fat ads are a major problem\u2014or that agencies and their clients are at fault.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think we have a good idea on realistically how much bloated ad sizes truly impact page load speeds,\u201d said Abe Diaz, vice president and associate media director at the agency RPA. \u201cI strongly believe that the bigger issue is the number of ads publishers are putting on pages, how and when those ads load, and all the various trackers that the sites themselves place on their pages.\u201d\n\nJed Hartman, chief revenue officer at the Washington Post, said agencies and their clients should not be blamed, arguing that the entire Web advertising ecosystem shares responsibility for tackling ad blocking and improving the user experience.\n\nHe urged the industry to move quickly, before ad blocking becomes more prevalent in mobile. \u201cThe ship has sailed in desktop,\u201d he said.", "date": null, "title": "Here\u2019s How Oversized Web Ads Are Encouraging Ad Blocking"}

The trend has been satirized by TV comedy show \u201cSouth Park\u201d, mentioned on Howard Stern \u2019s popular radio program, and featured in multiple news programs and morning shows including NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show.\n\nAd blocking has reached the big time.\n\nThat\u2019s largely because Internet advertising is going through something of a rough patch, at least in terms of consumer perception. People say they\u2019re increasingly frustrated with irritating and intrusive banners, videos and pop-ups, especially on the small screens of their mobile devices. They\u2019re also increasingly aware of the mechanisms being used to collect information about them behind the scenes as they move across the web. And some are suspicious of \u201cnative ads\u201d meant to blend in and look like editorial content.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, growing consumer frustration has coincided with the rise in ad-blocking tools, which many people now install on their computers and mobile devices in an attempt to remove ads from their Web-browsing experiences altogether.\n\nAd blocking is having a cultural moment, it seems. At least if you watch Comedy Central.\n\nDuring recent episodes of \u201cSouth Park,\u201d the long-running animated show on Comedy Central, the character Jimmy has the rare ability to distinguish between news and advertising.\n\nLater, a man tells Jimmy that ads adapted after humans created ad blockers. \u201cWhat if I were to tell you that ads have become smarter than us, and now they\u2019re manipulating everything we do?\u201d the character says. Ads became sentient and adapted to \u201cdisguise themselves as news in order to survive\u201d after humans created ad blockers, the man says.\n\nThe storyline struck a chord with many consumers, and in turn was highlighted by dozens of online media outlets which, ironically, rely on \u201csmart ads\u201d to support their own businesses.\n\n\u201cSo true it\u2019s scary\u201d, said one Twitter user in reference to one of the episodes.\n\nConsumers, it seems, are now savvy enough to understand elements of the complex online ad landscape, which for years has existed as a tangled web of networks and data-sharing relationships more or less out of view of mainstream culture.\n\nIn a moment of non-scripted drama, a radio caller this summer told Howard Stern how the host could use ad-blocking software to eschew YouTube ads. \u201cI\u2019m sitting through all these ads and you\u2019re telling me there\u2019s a way to avoid them? I should be so f\u2013ing on top of it,\u201d Mr. Stern said on the program.\n\nMonthly U.S. users of popular ad-blocking tool AdBlock Plus grew 44% between April 2015 and October 2015. A total of 13.2 million people in the U.S. used the software during October, according to Eyeo, the parent company of AdBlock Plus.\n\nApple fueled interest in ad-blocking in September when it enabled the technology in the latest edition of its mobile operating system, iOS, although reports suggest uptake of ad-blocking tools on Apple devices has been minimal so far.\n\nAccording to some estimates, ad-blocker adoption in the U.S. will accelerate. A recent survey conducted by Digital Content Next, a digital publishing trade association, found that 33% of consumers are \u201cvery likely\u201d or \u201csomewhat likely\u201d to try ad-blocking software in the next three months.\n\nAccording to DCN CEO Jason Kint, coverage in mainstream media and entertainment is helping to drive consumer adoption of ad-blocking technologies.\n\n\u201cOn a scale of one to ten, my concern is at a level eight or nine \u2013 our industry has ignored consumer concerns and now these same consumers are speaking up by installing ad blocking software,\u201d Mr. Kint said.\n\nWrite to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com and Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Ad Blocking Has Penetrated Pop Culture"}

WSJ Rumble Seat columnist Dan Neil discusses. Photo: Cadillac\n\nI HAD A RENDEZVOUS this week with the new Cadillac CTS-V Sedan ($97,985, as tested) at a little place called Road America, a venue chosen for purely exploitative reasons.\n\nSet deep in dairy fairyland in Wisconsin, Road America is the world\u2019s greatest country lane, a 4-mile dash around field and forest, mostly flat out, with globe-spinning corners, lurid braking zones and a concrete bottleneck called the Kink, scarred with tire marks and spilt oil. Cadillac\u2019s organizers had coned off the Kink and set up another speed-control zone at the Moraine Sweep, so I can\u2019t really say I\u2019ve bagged Road America. But I will have my satisfaction.\n\nI bring all this up because on such a day, in such a place, I\u2019m pretty sure Cadillac operatives could have pushed me around in a Chinese ox cart and still counted on favorable coverage. They did a little better than that, with the new CTS-V.\n\nLet me just whiteboard it for you: Big. Fast. American. Please read that with nuance. The CTS-V\u2014a high-performance variant of the mid- to full-size CTS sedan\u2014is not a perfect car. It\u2019s a tad heavier than I would prefer, by about one spinet piano. It\u2019s a bit Trump-classy.\n\nCadillac's new Performance Data Recording System combines hi-def video of your drive with overlaid graphics to create a final product that looks more like a video game than real life.\n\nFind me at the dog park and I will tell you all the ways Cadillac styling has gone wrong. The CTS model is manifestly between regimes, backing away from the daring abstractions of the Art and Science design theme and bowing to the desire for more traditional lines to please a new audience of Chinese burghers and bankers.\n\nHowever, I am happy to report all 2016 CTS\u2019s have gotten massively better in one unexpected way: They upgraded to a 3X more responsive processor in the center-stack CUE system, the flat-panel touch screen that might have been associated with increased shootings of dashboards.\n\nRoad America is also\u2014and this is important\u2014big, and the CTS-V needs room to shake a tail feather. Under the carbon-fiber hood, and behind that chain-mail maw, is a supercharged 6.2-liter direct-injection, two-valve V8 producing 640 hp at a soaring 6,400 rpm, amid the strident sucking from the supercharger like an interdimensional vortex. You are looking at the first straight-from-the-box 200-mph Cadillac.\n\nThe CTS-V\u2019s great whacking torque (630 lb-ft at 3,500 rpm) gives the driver some options around Road America, with its vast and pastoral 90-degree turns. Just pick your radius and apply too much throttle. While the CTS-V arcs and skitters at formidable speeds on molten micro-layers of liquefied Michelins, flirting with 1+ g cornering loads, the chassis remains eerily poised and graceful, even when it gets jostled by uneven pavement, requiring only minor counter-steering adjustments through the suede-wrapped wheel. GM emphasized reduced-roll center migration in the geometry of the rear five-link suspension, and it\u2019s noticeable: Once it takes a cornering set, the CTS-V is stable as a jeweler\u2019s bench.\n\n\u2018You are looking at the first straight-from-the-box 200-mph Cadillac\u2019\n\nAmong the V department\u2019s upgrades: The CTS-V uses zero-compliance cross-axis ball joints in the lower front control arms for more precise steering-feel, as with the smaller ATS-V. Credit also the brilliant, grippy 19-inch Michelin Pilot Super sport tires (265/35ZR19 front and 295/30ZR19 in the rear), which when overloaded laterally (over about 1 g) begin to sing and break away so progressively you can\u2019t go wrong. Just let her rip.\n\nAll of this makes the CTS-V feel very much like a Russian-doll version of the smaller ATS-V: 6 more inches of wheelbase, 445 pounds heavier, two more cylinders, 176 horses more, and another $23,530 to the price; but with the same brakes, tires, chassis dynamics and the same blithe, superport confidence. Cadillac claims the CTS-V can get to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds, a slim .1 second quicker than the ATS-V.\n\n2016 Cadillac CTS-V Sedan Photo: Cadillac Base price: $84,990 Price, as tested: $97,985 Powertrain: Supercharged 6.2-liter direct-injection overhead valve V8 with cylinder deactivation; eight-speed automatic with manual paddle shifting; rear-wheel drive with electronic limited slip differential. Horsepower/torque: 640 hp at 6,400 rpm/630 pound-feet at 3,500 rpm Length/weight: 197.6 inches/4,145 pounds Wheelbase: 114.6 inches EPA fuel economy: 14/21 mpg, city/highway Luggage capacity: 13.7 cubic feet\n\nAlas, unlike the ATS-V with its optional six-speed manual, the CTS-V swaps cogs only one way, with an eight-speed automatic.\n\nBut it\u2019s pretty terrific: fast, refined shift events in as little as 150-milliseconds, so whispering as to be almost ethereal.\n\nCadillac has gone to the expense of using costly magnesium paddles behind the steering wheel, which feel terrific for the first week that an owner has the car before he abandons them in favor of leaving it in D.\n\nNo shame in that. Around Road America even the pros just left it in automatic.\n\nThe CTS\u2019s suspension gets fortified \u2014aluminum multilink double-pivot front suspension flexing with GM\u2019s magnetic dampers, stiffer springs and stiffer anti-roll bar. But the overall calm of the car in transitions and high-g cornering\u2014the reduced roll-center migration the engineers describe\u2014owes much to the tightly strapped down five-link steel rear suspension. Cadillac says overall roll stiffness is up 20%.\n\nTo match that, chassis stiffness is also up 20%, says Cadillac, thanks to the dull-polished aluminum shear plate under the front half of the car. If you lift the carbon-fiber hood you\u2019ll see a lovely, beefy aluminum strut tower brace. There are more braces hidden, triangulating forces of the engine bay.\n\nNow some asterisks: When Cadillac says the CTS-V is an uncompromised luxury sedan that is track-ready off the showroom floor, that\u2019s true, but they don\u2019t say how many laps it\u2019s good for.\n\nOn a three-digit roller coaster like Road America, in a 4,145-pound, 200-mph road car, brake effectiveness becomes a matter of keen interest.\n\nThe CTS-V is fitted with Godzilla\u2019s own Brembos, vented 15.3-inch ferrous two-piece front rotors (steel cheeks and aluminum hubs) while the rears are 14.3-inch one-piece ferrous rotors.\n\nCadillac executive chief engineer Dave Leone suggested that more exotic ceramic composite brakes\u2014used because they shed heat more readily than steel rotors\u2014would have, on balance, offered less stopping power and would have been more costly. Meanwhile, he said, the ferrous rotors were every bit as fade resistant.\n\nMaybe. Journalists were permitted only two hot laps in every three-lap stint, and that, combined with the zone control, suggested to me a very definite limit to the steel rotors\u2019 ability to sustain prolonged abuse.\n\nBut those laps were memorable.", "date": null, "title": "Cadillac CTS-V: The World\u2019s Least Sedate Sedan?"}

BMW GROUP \u2026 of SHOW CAPTION HIDE CAPTION of\n\nTHE 2015 BMW X6 M costs $109,995, as tested, and is yet remarkably useless. Your head starts to spin the moment you open the driver\u2019s door: Whoa, the cabin is tiny. Where did all the room go? Hey, Frodo, stop at the store so I can get some ciggies.\n\nThis four-door, five-seat super crossover (mechanical twin of the X5 M) shares a rough length and wheelbase with other BMWs built on the compact, all-wheel-drive architecture (193.8 inches and 115.5 inches). It is also 5.6 inches taller, 6.3 inches wider and nearly 1,200 pounds heavier (5,185 pounds) than, say, a BMW 335i xDrive Gran Turismo, so you figure they might have carved out some interior inches somewhere.\n\nQuite the opposite. As compared with the Gran Turismo, front headroom is down 1.4 inches and front legroom down 1.7 inches. Rear legroom is down 3.62 inches and rear headroom similarly constrained. Like that fastback roofline? Please remember to place your head under the seat ahead.\n\nTake a walk around the glossy dome of the thing parked on the street, a bubble about to burst into high-speed droplets of depreciation. It looks huge, right? Activate the fastback power hatch to reveal the criminal lack of storage beneath (3 cubic feet). In terms of living space, this car is like the genie\u2019s bottle in reverse.\n\nRumble Seat columnist Dan Neil joins Lunch Break\u2019s Tanya Rivero to review the 2015 BMW X6 M and reminds us why speed isn\u2019t everything when it comes to cars.\n\nMany who take a hard look at the X6 \u201csport activity coupe,\u201d as BMW calls it, cannot figure out what is and moreover why it has sold about a quarter-million units world-wide since 2008 and nearing 50,000 in the States. What itch does this thing scratch?\n\nBut I propose this phenomenon is not unknown in automotive history, when it\u2019s the intimacy of the cabin, the close-coupled personal space, the shared privacy, the upholstered exclusivity that\u2019s the main attraction. Uselessness by design. Elbowroom is fine if you are sitting next to your sweaty uncle on the way to mom\u2019s funeral. But if it\u2019s just you and your dude or dudette, the automobile can be like the heart-shaped tub of Poconos honeymoons. Talbot-Lagos, Ford Mustangs, Auburn Boattail Speedsters, the list goes on. Love machines all.\n\nMeanwhile, the X6 M is hilariously fast. Last month, an X6 M orbited the Nurburgring\u2019s Nordschleife test track in a brisk 8:20, right around the best lap from a recent Porsche Boxster S or Cayman S. The requirements for that kind of pace begin with an audacity of rubber: 285/35 R21s in the front and 325/30 R21 mighty-wides in the rear. Then you stir all four wheels with the X6 M\u2019s hairy-chested twin-scroll biturbo 4.4 V8, with its nominal 567 hp and its over-brimming torque, 553 pound feet from 2,200 rpm to 5,000 rpm. That\u2019s a 10% bump in torque, year-over, for you power-mad Hobbits currently in the market.\n\nAdvantageously multiplied through a lightning-quick, marvelously transparent eight-speed torque converter automatic (replacing the previous six-speed) and funneled through the xDrive multiplate differential with rear-biased torque split and fully variable torque differential, front to rear, etc. and so on.\n\nThe net of it is a righteous, mechanically optimized tug at the tires\u2019 four honking contact patches: 0-60 snickers by in 4.0 seconds. From there it\u2019s your proverbial rocket-propelled baby bison to an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph, unless a buyer opts for the Driver\u2019s Package (not available in the U.S.), which deletes the speed limiter. I want no part of what comes next.\n\nOutside, feh. I\u2019m not feeling those wheel arch clearances at all. The X6 M\u2019s hitched up rear quarters, the visual mass, manages to dwarf even the 21-inch light alloy mega-wheels. And I will turn away modestly from the front mud flaps, the flexible aero bits that hang down below the grille in an incontinence of plastic.\n\nThe X6 M\u2019s minimum-security smile conceals the exotic workings of a new combined low-temp and high-temp cooling architecture comprising no less than 10 radiators and five coolant pumps arrayed in four separate cooling circuits. There is a bit over 4 gallons of coolant on board, between this and that, and roughly two and half gallons of oil in the wet sump.\n\nAnyway, that is a face only a Munich-trained technician could love.\n\n2015 BMW X6 M Photo: BMW GROUP Base price: $103,195, delivered Price, as tested: $109,995 Powertrain: Twin-scroll intercooled biturbo 4.4-liter DOHC V8 with variable valve timing; eight-speed torque converter automatic transmission with manual shift mode; permanent all-wheel drive with electronically controlled multi-plate differential with 100% variable torque split and limited slip rear differential. Horsepower/torque: 567 hp at 6,000-6,500 rpm/553 pound-feet between 2,200-5,000 rpm Length/weight: 193.8 inches/5,185 pounds 0-60 mph: 4.0 seconds Top speed: 155 mph (electronically limited) EPA fuel economy: 14/19 mpg, city/highway Cargo capacity: 3 cubic feet\n\nIt does have some fantastic side mirrors, with a conical element flopped toward the A pillars to better manage wind noise and aero drag. While the message might be hard to hear amid the rolling and balling and clubbing, BMW estimates consumption and carbon emissions are down 20%.\n\nAnother argument in favor? Schadenfreude. While Americans may gasp at the six-figure ticket, an X6 M purchased in the U.S. is a bargain compared with one bought by your German cousin, which starts at $128,587. Americans make out pretty well on the X6 M, until the Nor\u2019easter of depreciation washes away their docks.\n\nThere is also the vehicle\u2019s YouTube-friendly vehicle dynamics. A staple, nay, a clich\u00e9 of car porn videos is the drift, when a high-powered car spins its wheels and the driver swings the car\u2019s rear end through a corner like a pendulum, with full opposite-lock steering\u2014the full oppo. BMW\u2019s chassis engineers have developed special control algorithms for more \u201cdynamic flair\u201d at the limit, the media materials say. \u201cDeactivating DSC (through DSC off) gives the driver the chance to explore the vehicle\u2019s limits on the track and nudge it into power oversteer (i.e. a drift) using the accelerator. In this mode, the system will only intervene in extreme situations involving significant shifts in lateral acceleration.\u201d Be a better moron, through science.\n\nFitting such dancing shoes on a 2\u00bd ton, 5-foot-5-inch-tall crossover with 10-inch ground clearance and 115.5-inch wheelbase requires pretty fancy cobbling. Underneath, the front strut and rear air suspension has been reinforced with more rigid bearings and firmer bushings, increased front camber, higher damper rates, and other changes to the \u201celastokinematics.\u201d Drivers can ratchet up performance from Comfort, Sport and Sport+, with three separate controls for electric steering, suspension dampers and powertrain. The Servotronic steering grows progressively heavier and twitchier. The brake pedal seems connected to a force of nature (up front, six-pot fixed calipers with vented iron rotors, roughly 15 inches in diameter).\n\nIf you happen not to be at the Nurburgring, the X6 M can easily dial it down. In metro driving it\u2019s a serene and refined sport coupe with lapidary cabin details, lovely full-stitched dash, spar-epoxy carbon fiber trim, indirect lighting and accents. The cabin is brought to you by the letter M: M steering wheel, M thresholds, M upholstery, M door sill finishers.\n\nMmm. Where am I going to put the groceries? Never mind. More than metallic paints and fine hides and a towering price tag, the X6 M qualifies as a luxury item by virtue of its divine spark of uselessness.", "date": null, "title": "BMW X6 M: A Powerful Sports Car That Fails to Deliver"}

{"sourceurl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-primer-on-the-facebook-measurement-wars-1475617965", "sourcename": "wallstreet", "response_body": "Photo: Matt Rourke/Associated Press\n\nFacebook has been taking heat over the revelation that for two years it miscalculated a key metric, overestimating by as much as 80% the average time people spent watching video on its platform.\n\nSome in the ad world say the controversy highlights why Facebook and other big digital platforms shouldn\u2019t be \u201cgrading their own homework,\u201d but should instead be submitting to measurement by independent, third-party tracking companies. It\u2019s become a flashpoint for those arguing internet giants operate \u201cwalled gardens\u201d with little transparency.\n\nThe Association of National Advertisers has even called for Facebook to undergo a measurement audit.\n\nBut Facebook, which has apologized for video inflate-gate, says it already has some 20 partnerships with third-party tracking firms. So who is right? Is there a problem to solve here or not?\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the key questions:\n\n1. Which companies does Facebook work with for tracking ad campaigns and media performance?\n\nWhen it comes to tracking basics such as how many people see a Facebook advertising campaign and how viewable the ads are, Facebook relies on Nielsen, Moat, comScore and Integral Ad Science.\n\n\u201cThese partnerships are designed to provide marketers with a clear understanding of whether Facebook is driving the results they care about, while also protecting people\u2019s information,\u201d a Facebook spokesman said in a statement.\n\nEvery partnership is different. Moat, for example, now provides advertisers with data on a laundry list of metrics, including ad-completion rate, the duration a video was watched, whether the sound was on, the average audience per minute, and more. Moat says it can provide this data for Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, with a Snapchat integration set to come.\n\n2. So why didn\u2019t one of these partners notice that Facebook\u2019s metric for time spent viewing was off for two years?\n\nUp until this year, Facebook itself was the only source of any data on video duration\u2014the metric that it miscalculated. Moat only started tracking video duration at the start of 2016 and Integral Ad Science just recently started tracking such data.\n\nIn Moat\u2019s case, the company wouldn't have discovered the error on its own because it doesn\u2019t actually track the specific metric Facebook was found to be overcounting.\n\nAnd in general, Moat doesn\u2019t monitor Facebook\u2019s video data, said Jonah Goodhart, Moat\u2019s chief executive and co-founder.\n\nMoat CEO Jonah Goodhart, at the 2015 IAB annual leadership meeting, discusses how the digital advertising business needs to focus on better data and viewability metrics in order to win over more of marketers\u2019 budgets.\n\n\u201cMoat\u2019s reporting is independent of Facebook\u2019s and we don\u2019t check Facebook\u2019s own reporting,\u201d Mr. Goodhart said. \u201cWe also don\u2019t report the exact metric that was referenced in the Facebook calculation. Our duration metric is on those impressions that were viewable in video per the Media Rating Council definition as measured by Moat.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook mistake didn\u2019t affect billing, because the botched video metric isn\u2019t the basis for transacting business. Advertisers purchase video ads in one of two ways -- they can pay Facebook the instant ads appear on a user\u2019s screen, or pay only for those that are seen for at least 10 seconds.\n\nStill, some ad buyers saw the bad data as a red flag. One concern is that the faulty number could have affected how they allocated ad dollars to different platforms.\n\nPhoto: iStock Photo\n\n3. What would it mean for Facebook to get accredited, and what would be the point?\n\nThe ANA is pushing for Facebook to get accredited by the Media Rating Council, the industry\u2019s measurement standard-bearer.\n\nYou might ask, why would the MRC need to audit Facebook if all the tracking firms the social networking giant is working with have already been accredited for video viewability?\n\nTypically, the MRC audits and accredits measurement companies like Nielsen and comScore. Though some individual media companies have undergone audits as well in the past, it is not standard procedure. However in this case, platforms like Facebook and YouTube, since they are so huge and collect and self-report so much viewer data, act like media research firms in some respects.\n\nGeorge Ivie, MRC\u2019s chief executive and executive director, says even though Moat is accredited, the MRC would like to see how its technology is specifically integrated on Facebook, and how much data Moat collects directly.\n\nEach third party integration is different. Tracking firms like Moat may plug their data collection technology more directly into some sites than others, depending on the nature of the partnership.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re interested in learning more about Facebook-specific measurement given that we don\u2019t audit it,\u201d Mr. Ivie of MRC says. \u201cThe real question is, \u2018are the third-party metrics companies doing the measurement or receiving and recording the data [from the big social platforms]?\u2019 I don\u2019t know exactly what is going on.\u201d\n\nMr. Goodhart says Moat is able to collect detailed data on all the big platforms and added that he has previously shared details of its methodology with the MRC.\n\n\u201cWe provide Facebook with Moat Technology which Facebook hosts on their side,\u201d he said. \u201cMoat is being used within Facebook and Moat runs the same process and exhaustive series of ongoing tests as we do in every integration to ensure our measurement is working properly. Our work with Facebook and the other major platforms has helped marketers measure against metrics, such as the MRC-defined video viewability definition.\u201d\n\nMr. Ivie said Facebook and the MRC talked last Friday, and \u201cFacebook stated some willingness to move forward with certain discussions.\u201d He added, \u201cThey haven\u2019t committed to anything.\u201d\n\n4. Can\u2019t the industry settle on one useful video metric?\n\nAdvertisers would love this, but it turns out to be very hard to do. For starters, the various digital platforms are different\u2014it\u2019s not like TV where a 30-second ad on one network is the same exact format as a 30-second ad on another. It may be impossible to compare a video view in a news feed on Facebook, a video ad prior to an influencer video on YouTube, and a full-screen ad between videos created by friends on Snapchat, for example.\n\nMoreover, figuring out the \u201cunduplicated reach\u201d of an ad -- how many people saw it, minus the overlap across platforms -- is also very difficult.\n\n\u201cAdvertisers want to unduplicate their activity across these social platforms,\u201d said Tim Vanderhook, chief executive at Viant, an ad tech company acquired by Time Inc. earlier this year.\n\nTo be sure, Nielsen\u2019s Digital Ad Ratings product does help advertisers track online campaigns that run on multiple sites. But when it comes to the giant platforms like Facebook and YouTube, DAR is limited to tracking metrics such as audience reach and the number of ads delivered. It cannot track metrics like viewability and video duration across these outlets yet.\n\nSome ad buyers would like Moat\u2019s metrics to emerge as the new currency, the basis for transacting business, similar to the role Nielsen plays in the TV industry. And indeed, some digital media companies do allow advertisers to buy based on Moat metrics, Mr. Goodhart says, but Facebook doesn\u2019t. Its billing, as noted above, is based on its in-house metrics.\n\n5. Facebook wants to move to metrics that measure business outcomes. What does that mean?\n\nThis is Facebook\u2019s big push. Its 20 metrics partners include DataLogix (part of Oracle ), Acxiom, Nielsen Catalina and Marketing Evolution\u2014companies which in different ways can help marketers match up their own data with data from credit card companies or store loyalty programs so they can track whether the people who see their ads on Facebook actually visit their stores and buy their stuff.\n\nBut this is challenging, too. So many of Facebook\u2019s integrations with third-party data vendors are custom built for Facebook specifically.\n\nThis becomes problematic when advertisers want to get a comprehensive picture of the impact of a campaign. They might use DataLogix or Acxiom to see how the campaign worked on Weather.com or BuzzFeed, but that couldn\u2019t be melded easily with the data the companies get from Facebook.\n\nAs a buyer explained, \u201cIt makes it really hard to have an holistic view of performance across various channels and tactics.\u201d\n\nPhoto: AFP/Getty Images\n\n6. So what\u2019s the big-picture impact of all this?\n\nAll these measurement issues make it harder for an ad buyer to allocate budgets. A few years ago, an ad buyer may have been simply looking for enough data points to show that a digital platform -- say, Facebook -- should be part of a media plan. Now, the question is how much share of spending each of those platforms should be taking, especially in comparison to TV. That requires much better confidence in the numbers.\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "A Primer on the Facebook Measurement Wars"}

Photo: Hyundai Motor America\n\nTO ME, THE HYUNDAI BRAND will forever seem like a major-league expansion team. It wasn\u2019t in the league when I was growing up\u2014the Colorado Rockies? What kind of name is that, anyway?\u2014so it will never own the full legitimacy of history no matter how many pennants it brings home.\n\nAnd that\u2019s OK. We already have a Ford. Hyundai \u2019s role in the global passenger-car market is as an insurgent and disruptive force, shaking up the old franchises. No romance, no poetry, just a relentless, morally neutral march of commodity-car building across the globe. By unit sales, Hyundai is now the world\u2019s fifth largest auto maker. Hyundai\u2019s footprint in America includes California-based design studios, technical centers in Michigan and Arizona and vast assembly halls in Alabama, which disgorge daily fleets of crossovers and family haulers to driveways all over the northern continent.\n\nOccasionally readers will ask that I review more real-world cars and fewer six-figure sex machines. You command me, Effendi. It doesn\u2019t get more real than the redesigned 2015 Hyundai Genesis sedan.\n\nRe: disruption. You will note the discreet H on the trunk lid and, on the tip of the car\u2019s nose, the winged Genesis emblem. Hyundai publicly debated opening a separate premium Genesis line, \u00e1 la Toyota and Lexus, but chose to let the marketing chips ride on the Hyundai brand, at least in the U.S. And it is a bet, too, that there is sufficient elasticity in the name Hyundai to support sales of sedans costing nearly $70,000 (Equus) at the high end, $20,000 range (Veloster) at the low end, and in the middle, around $30,000, fleets of dependable, dispensable crossovers and family movers with virtually lifetime warranties, like the one my mother-in-law just bought.\n\n(May I just take the reader aside to share something personal? With due humility I note, you know, I\u2019m kind of a big deal, car critic for The Wall Street Journal and all that. I mean, she didn\u2019t even ask me. She just pulled up in a white Hyundai Tucson. What the hell, lady?)\n\nInterestingly, the Genesis and Equus cars both dispense with Hyundai badging in the prestige-obsessed home market of Korea. And this ambivalence has produced something kind of subversive and wonderful: a luxury car virtually without badging, a car in a Schr\u00f6edinger-esque, indeterminate state of being/not being premium. No one will know until he looks/doesn\u2019t look.\n\nFrom low to high, Hyundai\u2019s pricing structure has historically emphasized an unsubtle arithmetic of hellastuff per dollar, and that hasn\u2019t changed. Consider our test car, the Genesis AWD 3.8 sedan. Competing with cars like BMW 335i xDrive and Jaguar XF 3.0 with all-wheel drive, the Genesis AWD 3.8 certainly specs out like a premium car: a near full-size (196.5 inches), rear-drive sedan with naturally aspirated V6 power and eight-speed automatic. Not too many of those around anymore. The Genesis sits on a new five-link sport-tuned suspension, front and rear, with variable damping and variable electric steering (in the Genesis 5.0\u2019s Ultimate Package) and some very ready rubber around 19-inch alloys.\n\nFor those craving the luxury of too much torque, Hyundai offers the big gun, the 5.0-liter V8. This directed-injected all-aluminum engine produces up to 420 hp, putting it in a three-way segment tie with the Cadillac CTS V6 and Infiniti V8. However, the AWD system is available only with the brilliant 3.8-liter V6 Lambda engine\u2014the sensible choice anyway. The Lambda is a high-tech, high-comp monster (11.5:1) putting out 311 hp and 293 pound-feet in a quiet, sonorous hum.\n\nAWD availability has helped boost Genesis sales 60% in the past seven months, a pace which suggests pent-up demand. And then comes a raft, a slew, just a shopping list of stuff, some optional but a lot just kicked in, in the interests of invidious comparison. And whenever you talk about high-end Hyundais, you have to keep in mind all the optional equipment in the world doesn\u2019t add up to a luxury car. Here, the cabin is kind of joyless and a bit dated, design-wise. The Genesis\u2019 shared DNA with the Equus has imbued the smaller car with the big car\u2019s remoteness, in a segment where at least a few will still drive for the fun of it.\n\nBut it\u2019s got some gear. Of most consequence is the Automatic Emergency Braking system, which acts on data from the lane-departure and smart cruise-control sensors. It could also be called the Inattentive Driver Assist system. If you happen to be changing the radio station or digging through your purse for the toll transponder and fail to slow for stopped traffic ahead, it will do its level utmost to brake the car to avoid or at a minimum mitigate impact. Every car should, and I predict, will soon have this function.\n\n2015 Hyundai Genesis 5.0 The Hyundai Genesis featurs great seats, though the quality of leather is a bit mass-market. It is easy to get in and out and has lots of sightlines. Photo: Hyundai Motor America Base price: $40,500 Price, as tested: $52,400 (including $950 destination) Powertrain: Naturally aspirated direct-injection 3.8-liter DOHC 24-valve V6 with variable intake and valve timing; eight-speed torque converter automatic transmission; rear-biased all-wheel drive.

EPA fuel economy: 16/25/19 mpg, city/highway/combined Trunk capacity: 15.3 cubic feet\n\nOh but we are just getting started, Batman. There\u2019s the suite of Lane Change Assist, Blind-Spot Detection and Rear Cross-Traffic Alert systems that rely on rear-facing sensors to keep drivers apprised of what\u2019s coming up behind. Watching out front is the Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS), which puts an electronic hand on the tiller if the driver begins to wander.\n\nYou may be wondering, what if somebody were to hack your car\u2019s computer systems in such a way as to drive you over a cliff? That is a fascinating question. I trust the kids in the lab are working on that.\n\nWhat\u2019s the new Genesis sedan like to drive? Mighty comfortable, it turns out. Great seats, though the quality of leather is a bit mass-market. Easy in and out. Lots of sightlines. Refined. Isolated. The back seat is huge.\n\nThe key driver of the character is an aggressive campaign against noise, vibration and harshness. The Genesis\u2019 every nook and cranny is caulked and foam-filled to attenuate unpleasant aural radiations. The door panels are thicker and glass-to-body gaskets revised for less wind noise.\n\nHyundai has also put a lot of equity into high-strength steel, as compared with aluminum construction; and the numbers look good. Hyundai claims the Genesis chassis torsional and bending stiffness now exceeds that of a BMW 5-series. The curb weight for the V6 AWD model is 4,295 pounds.\n\nMeanwhile, the Genesis is one whole dress size bigger than its premium segment rivals: 123 cubic feet of interior space, according to Hyundai, handily outsizing an Mercedes E-class (113.1 cubic feet), whose numbers Hyundai was happy to provide.\n\nBig, powerful, with an overqualified equipment list, the Genesis sedan makes a strong case for itself. And it is even, actually, handsome, with the masculine, single-frame grille up front and lovely strakes of chrome at the rocker panels.\n\nIn the end the Genesis feels a bit like a Moneyball-managed baseball club, a sabermetrics-optimized collection of the best parts, pieces and players available for the money. It might be postseason, it might even go all the way. But it\u2019s just not quite as much fun to root for.", "date": null, "title": "Hyundai Genesis: What Makes the Car an Automotive Star"}

And cats, chinchillas and chickens. More specifically, Snapchat will soon be home to the web\u2019s seemingly endless supply of abandoned dogs who have been reunited with their families and positively adorable kittens who\u2019ve recently been rescued from chimneys.\n\nIndeed, starting on Dec. 1, the animal-centric web publisher The Dodo will become the latest member of the coveted Snapchat Discover club. The site will start publishing 12 pieces of content\u2014photos, articles, video and animation\u2014to Snapchat\u2019s exclusive Discover section seven days a week.\n\nThe Dodo is the first animal-focused brand on Discover, which features custom \u2018snaps\u2019 from media organizations ranging from Vice Media to Refinery29 to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe move comes as The Dodo\u2014which launched in 2014 and has raised over $18 million in venture funding\u2014is started to ink some of its first ad deals.\n\nThe site has looked to define itself with both heartwarming animal stories as well as a healthy dose of content focused on animal activism. Thus, there are plenty of headlines like \u201cChicken and Chihuahua Get Adopted into the Same Family\u201d and \u201cThis Dog Just Won The Mannequin Challenge\u201d but also hard-hitting pieces about how marine parks and zoos treat animals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re mission-driven,\u201d said The Dodo founder and Chief Creative Officer Izzie Lerer. \u201cWe want to make caring about animals a mainstream, viral cause.\u201d\n\nSo far, the signs are good. Though comScore pegged The Dodo\u2019s audience at 2.2 million unique users in the U.S. in October 2016, the brand has over 7.2 million fans on Facebook. Overall, The Dodo produces roughly 250 videos each month and is expected to surpass 1 billion video views in November, up from 800 million in October, the company said.\n\nMost of these views occur on Facebook, and the average video generates 200,000 engagements (likes, comments, etc.) and 30,000 shares, said The Dodo President YuJung Kim.\n\nThe Dodo is the latest brand on Snapchat Discover Photo: The Dodo\n\nBased on that kind of response, the two executives believe that Snapchat, given its short-form, highly visual nature, should be a strong fit. The two companies have been talking about working together for roughly six months, said Ms. Lerer. For now, the Dodo has tasked six staffers to focus on Discover, and has already gone through some test runs with Snapchat.\n\nBeyond Snapchat, Ms. Lerer said that The Dodo is considering expanding its editorial output, including a potential sub brand aimed at kids.\n\nAs part of the Snapchat Discover launch, The Dodo will be featuring custom ads produced by Universal Pictures for next month\u2019s release of the movie \u201cA Dog\u2019s Purpose.\u201d The Dodo sold this particular ad deal, while Snapchat will take a revenue cut. But going forward, Snapchat is looking to pull more ad sales in house, as CMO Today recently reported.\n\nGoing forward, Ms. Kim said that direct-sold display ads are a possibility on TheDodo.com, but the primarily focus will likely be on branded content videos on platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. The fact that the Dodo will soon be part of the just formed Group Nine Media, which will include the digital brands NowThis and Thrillist and is backed by a $100 million strategic investment from Discovery Communications Inc. , should help attract big advertisers, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been really encouraged by the reception from advertisers,\u201d said Ms. Kim. \u201cBrands like to align themselves with passion points, and we\u2019re at the center of that.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "The Dodo Launches on Snapchat Discover"}

But if they\u2019ve had one persistent gripe, it\u2019s been that Snapchat is behind other media companies when it comes to providing data on the performance of advertising campaigns.\n\nTo remedy that, Snapchat is teaming up with Nielsen to supply marketers with third-party data measuring their ad campaigns. In addition, Snapchat has inked deals with two ad tech companies, Innovid and Sizmek, to bolster Snapchat\u2019s ability to provide more granular data on campaign delivery.\n\nBut it\u2019s the Nielsen pact that will likely provide Snapchat with the validation it\u2019s been looking for in the ad community.\n\nSpecifically, Snapchat will be able to provide brands and agencies with Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings, which can track how many people a given ad campaign reaches. Essentially, buyers will be able to calculate the equivalent of a gross rating point for a campaign, including demographic data, which should help make Snapchat ads more comparable to TV.\n\nNielsen will be able to measure video ads that run within Snapchat Discover, the mobile app\u2019s hub where people can view content from the likes of MTV and Cosmopolitan, as well as Live Stories, the video compilations Snapchat regularly posts featuring spliced together clips shot by people at events such as the recent Nevada caucuses.\n\nMeanwhile, the ad tech firms Innovid and Sizmek will each supply ad tags\u2014essentially bits of code\u2014to bolster the more detailed tracking of how many times individual ads are delivered in campaigns.\n\nAd buyers have been clamoring for this sort of fundamental data to validate whether they are spending their money wisely trying to reach younger audiences. Snapchat has exploded in recent years and boasts of 100 million daily active users. But until now, advertisers have essentially had to take Snapchat\u2019s word when it comes to reporting measurements like audience reach and campaign delivery.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants more metrics and more insight,\u201d said Adam Shlachter, chief investment officer at DigitasLBi. Mr. Shlachter, who had not yet been briefed on Snapchat\u2019s announcement, said his agency has been discussing this issue with Snapchat for about a year. \u201cOne hundred million daily users sounds great, but I need an accredited source to validate that. This is definitely the direction we\u2019ve been asking them to go, to get on par with virtually every other major media platform.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Shlachter noted, nearly all of the digital media giants have eventually had to take this step. In recent years, for example, both Facebook and YouTube have had to bow to advertiser pressure and implement some level of third-party tracking. Now it\u2019s Snapchat\u2019s turn.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to bringing all the major measurement solutions to our platform,\u201d said Snapchat Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan in a statement.\n\nBeyond video ads, Nielsen is planning to provide data on other ad products, such as visuals people add to their Snapchat videos (i.e. sponsored geofilters and sponsored lenses) in the near future, Snapchat said.\n\nOf course, as Mr. Shlachter noted, the devil will be in the details. Ad buyers have long grumbled that Nielsen has moved slowly in being able to consistently track people\u2019s media consumption on devices beyond the TV. Advertisers will likely want to see how well Snapchat implements Nielsen\u2019s tracking mechanisms before declaring the partnership a victory.\n\nBesides upping its measurement game, Snapchat has been looking for other ways to deepen its ties to Madison Avenue. Just a few weeks ago, Snapchat announced that Viacom would begin selling some Snapchat ad inventory as part of a new multiyear partnership between the two companies.\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Snapchat Enlists Nielsen to Track Ad Campaigns"}

Photo: Adam Taylor/A&E\n\nAs television networks enter the frenzied ad-sales period known as the \u201cupfronts,\u201d they would seem to have a dismal story to tell. Cord-cutting is rising, ratings are sinking and ad-free streaming services such as Netflix are on the rise.\n\nAnd yet, the networks are poised for a surprisingly strong showing.\n\nEarly estimates from media buyers and analysts suggest that ad-spending commitments could increase 3% to 5% in this year\u2019s upfront market, when the bulk of inventory for the coming TV season is showcased.\n\nThat is a big reversal from the past few years. Broadcast TV has endured three consecutive years of upfront declines in terms of total ad spending while cable has dropped for the past two years.\n\nOne big reason: Last year many advertisers who pulled back on spending commitments at the upfronts ended up paying more\u2014in some cases 20% premiums\u2014for commercial time later in the year in what is known as the \u201cscatter\u201d market.\n\n\u201cAnybody who held money back last upfront got burned,\u201d said Jeff Lucas, head of ad sales at Viacom Inc., the parent company of MTV and Nickelodeon.\n\nThey will want to lock in deals now so they don\u2019t get burned again, the thinking goes. Cable networks already have started holding their annual upfront presentations for marketers, while broadcasters will follow next month.\n\nAnother potential boon to networks: Some advertisers who have made big bets on digital are coming back to TV because the return on their investment didn\u2019t live up to expectations, according to several ad buyers. Marketers are concerned about digital advertising issues including fake Web traffic generated by computerized \u201cbots\u201d and the lack of consensus on how to judge when an ad is \u201cviewable.\u201d\n\nProcter & Gamble, the nation\u2019s biggest advertiser, is one of the marketers that has moved some money back into TV, according to people familiar with the matter. P&G spent $1.4 billion on U.S. TV ads in 2015, down 12% from 2014, estimated Kantar Media. The company\u2019s TV ad spending, however, jumped 13% in January compared with the year-ago period, and preliminary data shows the trend continuing in February, said Jon Swallen, chief research officer of Kantar.\n\n\u201cFor our everyday products, driving awareness is important, and while the mix may vary by brand, region and some other factors, we see TV and digital not as an \u2018either or\u2019 but an \u2018and,\u2019\u201d said a spokeswoman for P&G. The company, she added, has been increasing its spending in both TV and digital to support brand campaigns. P&G declined to confirm the Kantar data.\n\nMore on Media and Ads Get the latest news and analysis on media and advertising via a daily newsletter, at WSJ.com/CMO.\n\nTelevision-ad spending has increased in certain categories. \u201cPharmaceutical companies have been spending money like drunken sailors,\u201d said Rino Scanzoni, chief investment officer of WPP PLC\u2019s GroupM, the world\u2019s largest ad-buying firm.\n\nLast year, overall prime-time upfront volume for broadcast networks slid 3.7% $8.36 billion, estimates Media Dynamics Inc., while cable TV\u2019s upfront haul declined 7.1% to $8.95 billion, according to the Video Advertising Bureau.\n\nThe fact that networks are expected to do much better this year isn\u2019t on its own a reason for media executives to celebrate\u2014unless they can carry that momentum to the rest of the year in the scatter market. Otherwise, marketers will have simply shifted their budgets from one period to another.\n\nResearch and ad-buying firm Magna Global predicts TV ad revenue for 2016 will grow 0.5% to $63 billion, excluding special events such as the Olympics and election spending.\n\nA scene from A&E\u2019s \u2018Duck Dynasty.\u2019 A&E is among the cable networks that have suffered a double-digit decline in prime-time viewership. Photo: Gurney Productions\n\nMeanwhile, the ratings picture is mixed, with haves and have-nots. Consider the cable TV industry. Prime-time viewership in cable overall is about flat compared with a year ago, according to Nielsen. The prime-time audience for Time Warner Inc. \u2019s TNT is down 11% from September to March, compared with the year-earlier period, and Viacom\u2019s Comedy Central has endured a 21% drop. A&E and History are among others that have suffered double-digit declines.\n\nNetworks with something to crow about to advertisers include Discovery Communications Inc. \u2019s Investigation Discovery, which is up 17%, Crown Media Holdings Inc. \u2019s Hallmark Channel, which is up 13% and Scripps Networks Interactive Inc. \u2019s HGTV, which gained 9%.\n\n\u2018Pharmaceutical companies have been spending money like drunken sailors.\u2019 \u2014Rino Scanzoni, chief investment officer of WPP Plc\u2019s GroupM\n\nDespite some recent gains, though, cable viewership generally has trended down during the past few years. Reruns, which were once popular on cable, have lost their luster and the glut of original content has further fragmented the audience among scores of networks.\n\nIn the 2012-13 season, USA Network, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon and TNT all averaged more than 2 million viewers in prime time. This season, all four are down more than 30% in viewers from then and no entertainment channel is close to the 2 million viewer mark.\n\nIronically, the higher prices in the so-called scatter ad market were themselves partly a result of drooping ratings. Many networks, unable to meet viewership guarantees they had made to advertisers at last year\u2019s upfronts, had to offer free inventory known as \u201cmake-goods,\u201d thereby tightening up the market and driving up per-unit costs.\n\nRob Sharenow, executive vice president of Lifetime and A&E attributed much of the ratings blues to changing viewing habits and copycat programming. \u201cThere was a lack of innovation in the production community and the network side,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Mr. Sharenow said he is encouraged, especially by two new A&E shows that are off to promising starts, \u201c60 Days In,\u201d a look at the prison system, and \u201cBorn This Way,\u201d about seven people with Down syndrome.\n\nNetwork executives say TV\u2019s greatest strength remains its ability to reach large numbers of people simultaneously.\n\n\u201cAs we all know, television viewing has experienced some declines across the industry,\u201d said David Levy, president of Time Warner\u2019s Turner cable TV unit. \u201cBut being down doesn\u2019t mean you still aren\u2019t the largest reach vehicle out there.\u201d\n\nWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com and Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Television-Ad Spending Shows Signs of Revival"}

At a press conference timed for Advertising Week in New York, executives said advertisers care more about how well Facebook ads impact their business than what can and can\u2019t be counted for each individual ad campaign.\n\nCarolyn Everson, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global marketing solutions, said that over the past several days, she\u2019s talked to many Facebook ad partners about the issue.\n\n\u201cUniversally, I\u2019ve heard that no one has actually utilized that metric,\u201d she said. \u201cIt did not impact (return on investment) and did not impact billing.\u201d\n\nMs. Everson emphasized that the video duration number was one of 14 different metrics available to advertisers.

Photo: Snapchat\n\nWhen marketers work with social media influencers on platforms like YouTube, Instagram or Vine, they are accustomed to getting detailed performance reports on how their ad campaigns perform.\n\nWhen marketers work with the still nascent collection of Snapchat influencers, they are lucky to get screenshots.\n\nScreenshots? Well, when a marketer pays a Snapchat creator to make a video featuring their brand, they typically have to rely on that creator to take a screenshot of their personal Snapchat page\u2014something only they can see\u2014with their phone. That\u2019s essentially the only way for an advertiser to know how many people see an influencer\u2019s Snapchat video and to feel comfortable that they got what they paid for (since most social influencers promise advertisers a certain amount of viewership for their content).\n\nUnlike YouTube, Facebook and other social networks, Snapchat doesn\u2019t post viewer numbers or subscriber figures publicly on its consumer app. Plus, unlike many open social platforms, Snapchat doesn\u2019t yet have an application programming interface, known as an API. On other social networks, marketers can use an API to buy ads and pull all sorts of data on individual creators, videos and ad performance.\n\nYet Snapchat, at least in its current incarnation, is all about keeping its data close to the vest. It\u2019s a social network that is fundamentally anti-permanence; people can create personal videos that disappear within seconds or video \u201cStories\u201d that last only 24 hours.\n\nSnapchat declined to comment for this article.\n\nAs more brands work directly with Snapchat influencers, they are learning about the limits of the reporting available from the red-hot platform. Experts focused on this nascent field say that this lack of data can cause minor headache or present serious challenges, particularly when millions of dollars are changing hands and brands need to get their messages out to consumers during a set period of time.\n\n\u201cNothing is public on Snapchat, and it\u2019s taken brands time to wrap their heads around that,\u201d said Alexa Tonner, head of partnerships at Collectively, which helps connect marketers with digital influencers. Ms. Tonner said that her team has started requiring Snapchat influencers in contracts to regularly take screenshots of their personal analytics and download the actual videos they produce for safekeeping, since most of them disappear from Snapchat in 24 hours.\n\nMost experienced Snapchatters comply. But, \u201cit can be kind of scary,\u201d said Ms. Tonner.\n\nA Snapchat campaign for the movie \"Insidious 3.\" Photo: Snapchat\n\nFor one thing, many Snapchat creators are young and not necessarily experienced business people.\n\n\u201cYou can have millions of dollars paid out in these campaigns, and they\u2019re basically being run on screenshots and text messages between C-level executives and teenagers,\u201d said Misha Talavera, co-founder at NeoReach, which also links marketers with Snapchat creators. \u201cStuff can get messed up.\u201d\n\nA Snapchat image created for Wal-Mart by social media influencer Meghan McCarthy. Photo: NeoReach\n\nAlas, teenagers are not necessarily the most reliable. Plus, the real world has a way of intervening in one\u2019s Snapchat screenshot schedule, noted Marco Hansell, founder at Speakr, another company focused on social media influencers. Mr. Hansell said sometimes a Snapchat creator might be on an airplane at the time they are supposed to log in and get their screenshot. Or their phone\u2019s battery might be dead at the end of a day when they\u2019d posted a sponsored Snapchat video.\n\nIf they don\u2019t get their screenshot in the 24-hour window, the brand\u2019s video and its data disappear. So Speakr requires influencers to check in multiple times a day. \u201cYes we\u2019ve had influencers miss check-ins before,\u201d he said.\n\nA look at social influencer Meghan McCarthy's Snapchat data for Wal-Mart campaign Photo: NeoReach\n\nWhy would marketers be OK with all this, particularly since they are accustomed to getting access to sophisticated analytics dashboards on other social platforms? Because Snapchat, which claims to reach 100 million users a day and generates 6 billion video views a day, is currently seen as the promised land for reaching millennials and younger demographics.\n\nMarketers these days are so enamored with Snapchat that they\u2019ll ease up on many of the requirements they push on other media outlets, ad buyers say. They\u2019ll even give up final approval of creative, which is very atypical in the marketing world.\n\nEvan Garber, a Snapchat influencer who has worked with advertisers such as Disney and General Electric, says that marketers provide him with outlines of what they\u2019d like to see in Snapchat videos. But, generally, \u201cbrands will give a lot of creative control,\u201d he said.\n\nOver time, marketers will likely want more control\u2014and more data. One startup, Delmondo, has built a new software product, Mercato, designed specifically to help fill the current Snapchat data void.\n\nAccording to Delmondo Chief Executive Nick Cicero, Mercato will help brands calculate a slew of key data points for Snapchat influencers, including how big their followings are, their average engagement rates and the projected performance of their videos. \u201cBrands can tap into this, put together a plan and then look at their results,\u201d he said.\n\nUntil then, brands better hope their Snapchat influencers have charged their phones.", "date": null, "title": "On Snapchat, Brands Trust Influencers, But Verify With Only Screenshots"}

Photo: Getty Images\n\nSnapchat has indicated it intends to shake up the structure of its content deals with media companies, a move rankling some publishers that post their articles and videos to the Snap Inc.-owned app.\n\nAs it stands now, publishers in Snapchat\u2019s Discover media hub can sell ads in their own channels, splitting the revenue with the app. Snapchat\u2019s own ad sales team also works to sell that inventory.\n\nNow the company has told some media partners that it wants to pay them a licensing fee and sell all the advertising itself, a model along the lines of how television networks pay studios for shows, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nIn addition to a flat licensing fee, Snapchat might also give some publishers a cut of the advertising revenue, albeit likely a smaller percentage than they would have commanded in the old system, the people said.\n\nRecode first reported Snapchat\u2019s plans for the changes. Snapchat\u2019s Discover page houses content from media outlets such as Vice, BuzzFeed, MTV, Mashable and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe shift in advertising strategy comes as Snapchat-parent Snap Inc. is preparing an initial public offering that could value the firm at $25 billion or more, The Journal reported.\n\nSome publishers are reticent to relinquish their control of the ad sales rights and are under the impression that they can still find a way to involve their sales teams, who have spent more than a year ramping up the sale of Snapchat ads.\n\nMedia outlets have been selling \u201cpackages\u201d to marketers that include Snapchat inventory, as well as ads on their other platforms like television or their websites. But Snapchat\u2019s change raises the question of whether media owners would be able to continue offering such deals.\n\nOther media executives are happy to accept a check from Snapchat and lean on the app\u2019s sales force, figuring that the guaranteed money makes it easier to decide what resources to dedicate to Discover.\n\n\u201cSnapchat knows their platform far better than we do. I\u2019m thrilled for them to go rep our content.

Google, Facebook and Twitter have long offered the same offline data-targeting options through their own Datalogix partnerships. Oracle acquired Datalogix in 2014.\n\nThis move follows Snapchat\u2019s rollout in September of Snap Audience Match, which lets marketers use their own existing lists of email addresses and mobile device IDs for ad targeting purposes.\n\nAfter being accused of moving slowly to incorporate advertising technology and targeting options, Snapchat has raced quickly over the past few years to build up its digital advertising infrastructure, particularly ahead of its parent company\u2019s planned initial public offering.\n\nThe social messaging app has partnered with more than a dozen ad measurement companies, for example.

Some in the TV space think Amazon might be able to pull off a \u201cskinny bundle,\u201d as other competitors like Hulu and Apple also work to solve the streaming TV puzzle.\n\nFiguring out a business model that works for media companies and keeps the price palatable for viewers has been one challenge for those trying. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are probably some matches that can be created there that can be fun and exciting and new, that would make sense both for customers and for media companies,\u201d Mr. Price said.\n\nAs of now, Amazon offers its service without advertising, so Mr. Price said he was not concerned about measurement giant Nielsen\u2019s efforts to measure the streaming business. While it could provide other TV market participants with better information about viewership, \u201cIt could drive some prices up, but by the same token it could drive some down. So I think everything would come out in the wash,\u201d Mr. Price said.\n\nAs for whether Amazon would ever tinker with an advertising-supported model, \u201cYou could imagine experimenting with various things in the future, but we\u2019re mostly focused on subscription, a-la-carte subscriptions and transactional video-on-demand,\u201d Mr. Price said.\n\nMr. Price said that while Amazon hasn\u2019t been on an international expansion tear like Netflix, it has big ambitions for select markets like India and Japan. He said Amazon is working to create original programming geared specifically for local markets.\n\nFor more, check out the episode and subscribe to the WSJ Media Mix podcast on iTunes, Google Play Music, Spotify or Stitcher.\n\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Amazon Studios Chief Roy Price Says Awards Drive Prime Memberships"}

Photo: Tyler Bissmeyer for The Wall Street Journal\n\nProcter & Gamble, the biggest advertising spender in the world, is ramping up the pressure on the internet\u2019s most dominant marketing platforms to urgently implement safeguards and independent verification to assure advertisers that their money is well spent.\n\nDigital ad giants Google and Facebook recently said they are prepared to let the Media Rating Council audit some of their data and ad metrics, following criticisms that such platforms have been grading their own homework, particularly after a series of measurement mistakes at Facebook. But, \u201cit\u2019s not enough,\u201d said Marc Pritchard, chief brand officer and marketing lead for P&G, at the Association for National Advertisers media conference in Orlando, Florida.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth mentioning that we are encouraged by the recent progress announced by the big players, Facebook and Google, and what we\u2019ve heard from several others,\u201d he said at the conference on Thursday, according to prepared remarks provided by the company. \u201cBut let\u2019s also be clear that the announcements indicate intention and work in progress. It\u2019s not enough until the verification and audits are actually implemented.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been more than patient because we made these requests nearly a year ago. So we need urgent completion, because then we can get to the more important work of understanding the value we\u2019re getting,\u201d Mr. Pritchard said.\n\nMr. Pritchard drew significant attention in the industry after he complained in January at the Interactive Advertising Bureau\u2019s Annual Leadership Meeting about the complexities in the digital ad business, confusing agency contracts and the need for more widespread adoption of an MRC ad viewability standard.\n\nOn Thursday, he said he\u2019s standing by those comments and his tough stance on problems that he described as \u201cmore acute\u201d in digital advertising, where advertisers are now spending $72 billion, \u201csurpassing TV.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes we deliver a high quality media experience, but all too often the experience is, well, crappy. We bombard consumers with thousands of ads a day, subject them to endless ad load times, interrupt them with pop-ups and overpopulate their screens and feeds. And with ad blockers growing 40% and fraud as high as 20%, who knows if they\u2019re even seeing our ads,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Pritchard encouraged the industry\u2019s marketers, agencies, publishers, ad tech platforms and suppliers to take action and reiterated the steps that P&G already said it planned on taking, including adopting one global viewability standard from the MRC.\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s the minimum standard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know it\u2019s probably not perfect, but we\u2019re adopting this standard in order to move forward to conduct business on a level playing field across platforms and publishers.\u201d\n\nHe also said that companies have been slow to respond to issues plaguing the \u201cmedia supply chain,\u201d in part because they have fallen victim to industrywide \u201chead fakes,\u201d such as \u201cThe MRC standard is the lowest common denominator.\u201d \u201cYep, it is, and that\u2019s exactly what we need and want,\u201d he said.\n\nOther excuses that he referred to as \u201chead fakes\u201d included, \u201cWe don\u2019t have sourced traffic because of privacy controls\u201d and \u201cWe get cheaper rates from low-cost publishers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt P&G, we are choosing to vote with our dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already achieved media supply chain efficiencies, and believe there is a long runway ahead.

Nickelodeon is the first to present its new programming during upfront season since Mr. Bakish announced his plan to focus on six key channels, including Nickelodeon, amid the struggling media giant\u2019s turnaround efforts. If that\u2019s not enough pressure for Nickelodeon, kids channels must now find new ways to attract ad dollars as it gets tougher to capture the attention of young, and increasingly digital, viewers. The cable channel\u2019s plan is to introduce new shows and spinoffs, and focus on hit shows like Henry Danger. As Variety reports, Nickelodeon is also thinking beyond TV, with plans to launch a new, multi-day festival called \u201cNickelodeon SlimeFest.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s kids are coming of age in a revolutionary period of change, in tech, entertainment, politics and culture, and these factors have definitely influenced how they see the world,\u201d Ms. Zarghami told ad buyers in the audience, Deadline reports.\n\nTARGET IN SIGHT: At a time when Facebook lets advertisers target all manner of audience segments -- be it mountain biking enthusiasts in Colorado, married homeowners with multiple lines of credit or Spanish-speaking heavy metal lovers -- TV executives know that targeting based on Nielsen\u2019s basic demographic data (like men 18-49) feels quaint. For this year\u2019s upfront TV marketplace, NBCUniversal is putting $1 billion in ad inventory aside in to be sold on metrics that go beyond Nielsen guarantees, reports Ad Age. That\u2019s double the amount it held for a similar purpose last year and a fairly substantial commitment given that NBC generates approximately $6 billion in ad sales from its upfronts, according to Variety. The idea is that, for example, an automaker could aim a spot at households making over $100,000 and a car lease set to expire, the story notes. CMO Today\u2019s Mike Shields notes that NBCU will be guaranteeing reach to targeted audience segments, but not business outcomes (like the actual purchase of a car). NBCU, owner of the NBC network and cable channels like USA and Bravo, tells him it will provide data back to brands on how campaigns perform, potentially in conjunction with a third party like Moat.\n\nCHA-CHING: Snap Inc.\u2019s debut on the public market was a success, as the messaging app company\u2019s shares surged 44% on the first day of trading, The Wall Street Journal reports. Now comes the hard part: the challenges awaiting Snap include ratcheting up user growth and revenue per user, managing concerns about the founders\u2019 high level of voting control and figuring out where hardware fits into a business otherwise dominated by ads. Oh, and despite a torrid pace of growth last year, the company lost $500 million. BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Kantrowitz points to another emerging issue: its creators (a.k.a. \u201csocial influencers\u201d) are starting to post less on the platform, because they aren\u2019t feeling the love, he reports. Some analysts aren\u2019t buying the early hype: Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research placed a sell rating on the stock with a $10 target, Business Insider reports. Ouch.\n\nSLOWDOWN AHEAD: Ad giant WPP reported its slowest quarter of revenue growth since 2012 and forecast slower growth for 2017, sending shares down nearly 8%, reports WSJ. Total annual revenue rose 18% to \u00a314.39 billion last year. But like-for-like net sales, a measure used to judge the company\u2019s underlying performance, increased only 2.1% in the fourth quarter, its slowest rate since the third quarter of 2012. The company, which owns creative, digital and media agencies like J. Walter Thompson, AKQA and Mindshare, said it is planning for around 2% growth in both revenue and net sales for 2017, attributing the slowdown to fewer new business wins in recent months and a \u201ctepid\u201d macroeconomic environment. WPP lost big clients like AT&T Inc. and Volkswagen AG in 2016, and faces pressure from marketers who are rethinking their strategies as consumers\u2019 viewing and shopping habits change.\n\nElsewhere\n\nFacebook is working on a feature that will \u201cspotlight\u201d original shows and other exclusive long-form video in its video tab. The company is focused on licensing scripted and unscripted shows in genres including science, sports, pop culture, lifestyle, gaming and teens.

Companies typically turn to public relations firms for advice on dealing with issues such as product recalls, plant fires and malfeasance by board members. But now there\u2019s a new PR nightmare keeping company executives awake at night: An attack from the president. As Donald Trump bashes auto makers like General Motors for manufacturing cars in Mexico and criticizes Nordstrom for dropping Ivanka\u2019s fashion label, U.S. companies are increasingly worried about being prepared for the fallout from an unexpected Trump tweet. That\u2019s good news for public relations agencies, which say they\u2019ve seen an influx of business in the past few months from companies happy to pay for their very own \u201cTrump strategy,\u201d CMO Today reports. While the president and his administration dominate the news cycle, it\u2019s also proving harder for companies to pique the interest of major media outlets with story pitches about product launches and other company news. Luckily, PR firms say they\u2019re happy to lend a helping hand.\n\nSNAP UP A STAKE: NBCUniversal revealed last week that it invested $500 million in Snap Inc. as part of the company\u2019s initial public offering. But the big question is what, exactly, NBCU hopes to gain from its \u201cstrategic investment\u201d in the mobile messaging company. The Snap stake doesn\u2019t give NBCU any special privileges, The Wall Street Journal reports, but the media company\u2019s executives hope to strengthen ties with the young company and maybe be the first call Snap makes when it\u2019s looking for partners to trial new media and ad products. After investing in content-centric digital media companies like BuzzFeed and Vox in recent years, NBCU was eager to get closer to a major distributor. As opposed to Facebook or Google, NBCU executives came to view Snapchat as the most friendly to media companies, in part because it allows NBCU to sell ads against its own content on the platform. Meanwhile, the Journal reports that Snap\u2019s shares have also been popular among millennial investors, many of whom happen to be avid users of Snapchat.\n\nDISPUTED NEWS: In an attempt to slow the spread of intentionally false news across its platform, Facebook has begun labeling links to some articles as \u201cdisputed,\u201d Recode and Gizmodo report. In addition to a red warning label underneath links to dubious stories, Facebook is also directing users to pages on fact-checking sites such as Snopes and PolitiFact explaining why the content might be misleading. A story might be marked \u201cdisputed\u201d if users report it as inaccurate and then at least two of Facebook\u2019s fact-checking partner organizations agree. But, as Recode points out, the downside of the system is that Facebook doesn\u2019t want to make these calls on its own (even the easy ones), and relying on others slows things down. Facebook first announced the plans to use third-party fact-checkers in December, and also announced a tweak to its trending topics box to ensure only topics appear there that have been covered by a significant number of \u201ccredible\u201d publishers.\n\nAMAZON\u2019S SEARCH: For a $37 billion market, the search advertising business is a relatively uneventful one. That\u2019s because Google has for years dominated online searches and, as a result, search ad spending. But there\u2019s a chance that could be about to change, CMO Today reports, as Amazon and Pinterest step up their efforts to capture marketers\u2019 search advertising budgets. Amazon isn\u2019t about to launch a dedicated search engine anytime soon, but it\u2019s spent the past few years quietly rolling out a handful of products designed to help marketers place their products and services in front of consumers as they search for things on Amazon. Meanwhile, Pinterest is also vying for attention from advertisers with a new, more visual search ad product that it hopes will reach consumers before they decide what they want to buy and turn to Google\u2019s search box to find it.\n\nElsewhere\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of hype around virtual reality, but marketers are finding that creating videos for VR devices can be expensive and that audience reaction to their efforts can be tepid. [NYT]\n\nGoogle Home, the search giant\u2019s voice-activated virtual assistant, could be reading users \u201cfake news\u201d and other inaccurate information when they ask it questions about politics. [Quartz]\n\nA network of right-wing media outlets anchored around conservative website Breitbart strongly influenced the broader media agenda in the run-up to the November election, according to a new study by Columbia Journalism Review. [CJR]\n\nDigital ad spending in the U.S. overtook TV advertising in 2016, based on some estimates. But according to Turner CEO John Martin, TV is seeing a resurgence as marketers redirect their ad money from digital channels back to TV. [Business Insider]\n\nTime Inc.\u2019s refreshed C-suite is plotting the storied magazine publisher\u2019s future, as potential acquirers circle the company and its stable of titles fight to maintain relevance in the digital age. [NYT]\n\nVox Media-owned sports blog network SB Nation appointed its first editor in chief as it chases further growth. One of the company\u2019s strategies to reach sports fans is to publish more video natively on social media sites. [Poynter]\n\nThe idea of fusing \u201ccontent and commerce\u201d businesses was in vogue in 2010, when male-focussed lifestyle website Thrillist bought flash-sale site JackThreads for $10 million. But, in practice, fusing the two business models wasn\u2019t as easy as the companies had hoped. [Digiday]\n\nSocial networks and online publishers are experimenting with ways to reduce unpleasant comments or \u201ctrolling\u201d on their properties. One Portland startup forces anyone who wants to comment to first evaluate other comments for civility, for example, while a Norwegian website is quizzing users to ensure they actually read an article before they\u2019re allowed to comment on it.

These kinds of comments have prompted a number of companies to turn to PR agencies who can help them prepare for similar threats. Photo: Associated Press\n\nFrom product recalls to unwieldy CEOs, public relations experts have seen it all. At least, they thought they had.\n\nThen the U.S. elected a president who tweets whatever is on his mind: bashing auto makers like General Motors for manufacturing cars in Mexico, declaring companies like the New York Times to be \u201cfailing,\u201d criticizing Nordstrom for dropping his daughter\u2019s fashion label, and complaining about the cost of Boeing\u2019s 747 Air Force One.\n\nAs President Donald Trump calls out specific corporations, not only is he fueling an unprecedented amount of anxiety among executives, he also is creating an influx of business for public relations agencies.\n\n\u201cThis is the first situation like this we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Gene Grabowski, who has spent over two decades in Washington, D.C.-focused PR and advocacy roles and is now a partner at crisis communications firm KGlobal. Clients typically ask for advice on how to be prepared to handle plausible scenarios like a plant fire, huge product recall or malfeasance by a board member, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time clients reached out asking, \u2018What do we do if the president attacks us?\u2019 This is now a category,\u201d said Mr. Grabowski.\n\n\u201cAttack by the President\u201d is now among the scenarios that the firm jots down on a whiteboard during routine crisis and issues management exercises for clients. The purpose is to discover what\u2019s most likely to happen, how likely it is to happen and then how to react, said Mr. Grabowski. His firm has had discussions with at least three clients about developing a \u201cTrump strategy.\u201d\n\nIn Mr. Trump\u2019s first six weeks in office, companies have been confronted with how to respond to his public outrage that they would move U.S. jobs or operations outside the country. Mr. Trump campaigned heavily on promises to put Americans back to work, and since his election, he has been vocal about efforts to work with individual companies to retain jobs and create new ones.\n\nExecutives have also been put in the tedious position of figuring out how to react to polarizing policy changes like immigration.\n\nCorporations have put out carefully worded responses and, in some cases, made actual changes to their business plans\u2014sometimes even allowing Mr. Trump to claim credit for influencing those decisions.\n\nBehind the scenes, most of these interactions are carefully managed by public relations experts. As more of these fast-moving scenarios play out in public and executives fear a 140-character tweet will send their stock price tumbling, more companies are paying up to be prepared for the worst.\n\nAfter a handful of clients reached out for help, Zeno Group, a PR agency within the Daniel J. Edelman network, recast its crisis and issues resources to create a formal approach that uses insights from both the U.S. administration change and Brexit, said Kim Metcalfe, executive vice president of corporate affairs at Zeno. The new offering, dubbed Zeno Seismic, focuses on \u201chow companies should deal with massive unexpected business and societal changes,\u201d she said. At least six clients have reached out for help over the past few weeks.\n\nSeeing \u201cthe correlation between a tweet and a stock price, it\u2019s enough for them to realize they need to pay attention,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s also getting tough for PR professionals to do their bread-and-butter work of getting publicity for their clients\u2019 product launches and other developments. National media outlets are spending more time covering Trump\u2019s administration, and people are increasingly getting their news from outlets that cater to their views, Ms. Metcalfe said.\n\nPeter Duda, executive vice president and co-lead of the global issues and crisis practice at Weber Shandwick, said that his shop has seen an uptick in demand from clients who want crisis preparedness plans that address a \u201cnew, more highly politicized environment.\u201d Managing reputations and brand equity is taking up more of the firm\u2019s time since the election, he said.\n\nFor example, Weber Shandwick was recently contacted by a \u201cU.S. multinational financial services company that wants our help to protect its brand and corporate reputation in Mexico, given the anti-American sentiment that\u2019s growing due to the administration\u2019s proposed policies,\u201d Mr. Duda said. The work will include a simulation drill for the management team that will offer up a fictitious crisis -- a piece of information that quickly spreads to the news media, for example\u2014and provide a forum for discussing the various ways they can respond or \u201cmanage the repercussions of inaction.\u201d\n\nAnother PR agency executive said his team advised the CEO of a large technology client to publicly avoid speaking about \u201cthings that could draw the ire of the new environment in Washington,\u201d such as immigration policy. If the CEO is asked publicly about what\u2019s happening in Washington, the client is being advised to \u201ckeep to things about the business, and business in the new environment,\u201d this executive said.\n\nIn the last two months, half a dozen clients have reached out asking for help in evaluating whether they have \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d that might make them a target or in dealing with actual crises related to the Trump administration, said Don Baer, CEO of Burson-Marsteller. That is an unusual amount of activity, he said.\n\nEven companies who likely \u201cwould never be targeted\u201d by President Trump, including some Fortune 300 clients, are asking for support, said Kris Balderston, president of global public affairs at FleishmanHillard. The president \u201cdoesn\u2019t know they exist, but everyone is kind of afraid.\u201d\n\nTo get in front of any potential dust-up, Mr. Grabowski said his firm is also helping clients with preventive measures, like proactively sending factsheets to Congressmen with information about clients\u2019 contributions to jobs, taxes and charities in their districts.\n\n\u201cManaging Donald Trump is like managing a boss,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t become a target. Never pick a fight.\u201d\n\nWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "\u2018Attack by President\u2019 Is Big Business for PR Agencies"}

But the giant ad agencies whose creative teams conceive commercials also have been ramping up in these areas in the past several years, pursuing a growing revenue stream.\n\nThe Justice Department is investigating whether ad agencies are manipulating the bidding process, urging independent companies to inflate their prices so that contracts could be awarded to the agencies\u2019 own production and postproduction outfits, according to the people familiar with the matter.\n\nPrice-fixing and bid-rigging are prohibited under federal antitrust law.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear which agencies are the subject of the government\u2019s inquiry. Many of the big agency holding companies, including WPP PLC, Omnicom Group Inc., Interpublic Group and Publicis Groupe SA, have in-house production and postproduction divisions.\n\nRepresentatives of WPP, Interpublic, Omnicom, and Publicis declined to comment.\n\nNancy Hill, chief executive of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, a trade group that represents agencies, said in a statement: \u201cIt goes without saying that we require our member agencies and their staffs to follow the letter of the law.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s probe adds a layer of controversy to an industry in which trust between the major parties in the estimated $529 billion global ad business is already fraying.\n\nIn June the Association of National Advertisers, a trade group that represents big advertising clients, released the results of a seven-month probe that found agencies are shortchanging clients through nontransparent business practices.\n\nThe group\u2019s report, which didn\u2019t point to specific ad agencies, detailed a range of suspect practices, such as agencies getting rebates from media sellers for reaching spending thresholds on behalf of their clients.\n\nBig ad companies have denied wrongdoing. The report has caused marketers to launch a wave of audits of their media-buying contracts with agencies.\n\nMs. Meiklejohn\u2019s inquiry has some ties to the ANA transparency probe. Shortly after the group\u2019s report was released, she contacted people close to the probe to see if they uncovered anything related to the bid-rigging allegations she was already investigating, said several of the people familiar with the matter.\n\nK2 Intelligence, the corporate investigation firm that conducted the trade group\u2019s probe, uncovered allegations of bid-rigging in the postproduction business, according to people briefed on the matter.\n\nThat material was spelled out in an early draft of the report but didn\u2019t make it into the final version, which was focused on the media-buying business.\n\nThe trade group currently has a task force looking into the issues it discovered in the postproduction sector, according to a person close to ANA.\n\nMs. Meiklejohn held discussions with people involved in the probe and obtained the information about bid-rigging allegations, the people said.\n\nThe language in the early ANA draft claimed that \u201csome creative agencies\u201d are increasingly directing \u201cpostproduction projects to affiliated companies within the same Agency Holding Companies,\u201d according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe relevant passage said six producers and editors from independent production firms reported being asked to submit so-called \u201ccheck bids\u201d on projects that agencies had already determined were going to their in-house outfits.\n\nThe postproduction companies were urged to inflate their bids \u201cto create a paper trail that justified to the advertiser its decision to award the project to an in-house facility, which provided a rival bid at a lower price,\u201d the draft ANA language said.\n\nMs. Meiklejohn also has subpoenaed K2, the investigative firm, to gain additional information, one of the people familiar with the matter said.\n\nIndependent production firms have begun making a case in public about their grievances. In October, AICE, a trade group that represents independent postproduction firms, sent a statement to its members that accused advertising companies of engaging in unfair business practices to keep advertiser postproduction work in-house.\n\nThe AICE memo said independent firms often feel coerced into providing check bids \u201cfor fear of alienating an agency and risking future opportunities for work.\u201d\n\nWhile ad agencies have been offering production and postproduction services to some extent for decades, they have doubled down on this area of the business over the past few years to find new revenue streams and to help address marketers\u2019 growing need for more ad content because of the rise of social media.\n\nMadison Avenue is familiar territory to Ms. Meiklejohn. Following a 2002 federal investigation into alleged bid-rigging in the advertising, printing and graphics industries, the Justice Department, with the help of Ms. Meiklejohn, sent several executives to jail for antitrust violations and tax fraud.\n\nWrite to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com and Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Ad Agencies Probed Over Contracts to Produce Commercials"}

In this process, Snapchat is taking steps to make sure it does not employ any personally identifiable data when executing these ad campaigns.\n\nThe company has been quietly testing this offering over the past few months with brands like eBay. Consumers will have the option to opt out of the Audience Match product.\n\nAnother new initiative, Snapchat Lifestyle Categories, lets brands direct ads to people who consume certain types of videos (like sports or gaming content). Lastly, Snapchat is helping advertisers target ads to consumers who exhibit a certain set of characteristics that are similar to an advertiser\u2019s existing customers-- a product Snapchat is calling \u201cLookalikes.\u201d\n\nThese tactics are rather standard fare for many digital media outlets, but their introduction amounts to a noteworthy evolution for Snapchat, which has been conservative about the targeting capabilities it offers. Snapchat founder Evan Spiegel was famously quoted as saying that he doesn\u2019t want advertising on the app to be \u201ccreepy\u201d for consumers.\n\nBefore Tuesday\u2019s announcement, brands could target campaigns based on age or gender, but marketers wanted more.\n\nEven though Snapchat reaches 150 million unique users a day, running ads that \u201cblanket that audience\u201d or employ base level targeting like geography and people\u2019s ages, are \u201cjust not sufficient,\u201d said Sarah Hofstetter, Chief Executive at the agency 360i.\n\n\u201cSnapchat has the audience,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2019The question was always, do they have the targeting?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe company says it has no plans to support \u201cretargeting,\u201d when users see ads around the web for a retailer whose site they recently visited.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working hard to show our community engaging, relevant ads, in turn helping our advertising partners drive amazing return on investment,\u201d said Imran Khan, Snapchat\u2019s chief strategy officer.\n\nEarly test campaigns have shown that consumers are watching more ads in their entirety thanks to the targeting, said Ms. Hofstetter.\n\nLlibert Argerich, eBay\u2019s global director for social and content, said the company is currently running seven different ad efforts on Snapchat, and two have been employing the Audience Match product since May.\n\neBay is using that tool to show consumers one of three different video ads, depending on who they are and their buying history on eBay. \u201cIt\u2019s about being more relevant,\u201d he said. So far, eBay is seeing measurable improvements in consumer engagement and positive return on investment, Mr. Argerich added.\n\n\u201cSnapchat has been building its monetization from the ground up, and they had early growing pains.

It makes a lot more sense for them to acquire a brand that has a proven track record than to try to develop this in house, given all their other priorities.\u201d\n\nMr. Hippeau said that his firm reviewed the presentations of about 1,700 companies last year and made 40 investments. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a great idea, obviously, and a great idea is a kind of \u2018a-ha, it\u2019s obvious that there is a need in the marketplace,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Hippeau also said that timing is critical. \u201cWe love virtual reality and we love augmented reality, but we\u2019ve made just a couple of investments so far because it looks like the market is still early, and is not going to develop as a mass market for another two or three years,\u201d he said. But, \u201cIf you\u2019re too late, then you fall into that \u2018me too\u2019 category.\u201d\n\nFor more on Mr. Hippeau\u2019s investing strategy, check out the episode and subscribe on iTunes, Google Play Music, Spotify or Stitcher.\n\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Venture Capitalist Eric Hippeau Says Digital Media Is Just Taking Off"}

But according to its new chief executive, Erika Nardini, that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nAs some publishers race to reach as many people as possible with content tailored for sharing on platforms such as Facebook, Barstool Sports has instead focused on reaching a relatively small, but highly passionate and engaged, community.\n\n\u201cBuzzFeed has set the bar for mass-production, mass-audience. There are many, many, many publishers chasing that and I would argue a high percentage of them are caught in the middle: they haven\u2019t figured out mass-production, they haven\u2019t figured out a voice that speaks to a mass audience, and that\u2019s created a lot of challenges for publishers,\u201d Ms. Nardini said on the latest episode of the WSJ Media Mix podcast.\n\nBarstool Sports sits closer to the opposite end of the spectrum, she said, which affords it the ability to experiment with different revenue models beyond just selling advertising. Many of Barstool\u2019s readers are fans of the brand itself, said Ms. Nardini, the former AOL chief marketing officer who has hired as CEO of Barstool Sports last month.\n\n\u201cBarstool is a brand someone relates to. It means something, there\u2019s a humor there, there\u2019s a voice there. As a result of having that brand, it\u2019s a publisher that has a content business model, a commerce business model and a conversational business model,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to selling advertising, Barstool also generates revenues by selling Barstool Sports-branded merchandise and increasingly hosting ticketed events for its community.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a strong brand, you\u2019re able to monetize and create commerce opportunities around the brand that you couldn\u2019t create otherwise.

Photo: Getty Images\n\nThe lack of diversity on Madison Avenue has been a hot-button issue in the advertising world, particularly after a handful of flashpoint incidents brought renewed attention to the problem in recent months.\n\nBut the industry\u2019s problems are bigger than a few bad apples, according to Cindy Gallop, former advertising executive, consultant and public speaker. Making the ad business more diverse is a challenge given its current structure.\n\n\u201cAt the top of our industry, as at the top of every industry, there is a closed loop of white guys talking to white guys about other white guys,\u201d she said on the latest episode of the WSJ Media Mix podcast. \u201cThose white guys are sitting very pretty. They\u2019ve got their enormous salaries, their gigantic bonuses, their lavish expense accounts, and their huge pool of stock options. Why on earth would they ever want to rock the boat?\u201d\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Kevin Roberts, the former executive chairman of Publicis Groupe\u2019s Saatchi & Saatchi, resigned following an interview where he largely dismissed the gender diversity issue. In fact, Mr. Roberts told Business Insider that Ms. Gallop is \u201cmaking up a lot of the stuff to create a profile.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery few months, something like this happens in our industry. A senior white guy becomes a lightning rod for this issue,\u201d Ms. Gallop said. \u201cThe depressing thing is that means change isn\u2019t happening. If it were happening, those regular lighting rod moments wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nMs. Gallop said that, for marketers and agencies, diversity should be considered a business imperative. Ads created by a group of creative minds more representative of the overall gender and racial mix of the population would reflect the increasingly diverse pool of would-be consumers.\n\nScripted training and mapped-out hiring initiatives aren\u2019t the answer, Ms. Gallop said. Companies that implement a diversity program in practice often feel fine carrying on as things are, she said. \u201cStudies have proven that if you do something that\u2019s virtuous, you then feel that gives you license to do something that isn\u2019t. At a very basic level, if you substitute diet soda for your full-fat soda, you can now go eat a bag of chips,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Gallop noted that women sometimes tell her that they do not want to be hired just because they are women. \u201cMy response is, \u2018Get over it.\u2019 All around you are mediocre men who got hired because they were men. Get hired because you\u2019re a woman, welcome the opportunity and then do the bloody brilliant job in that role you\u2019re going to do anyway, and prove how much you deserve it.\u201d\n\nFor more with Ms. Gallop, check out the episode and subscribe on iTunes, Google Play Music, Spotify or Stitcher.\n\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Cindy Gallop Takes On Advertising\u2019s \u2018Closed Loop of White Guys\u2019"}

The two companies will collaborate on creating digital and TV programming, and they will also sell advertising together.\n\nHow Refinery29\u2019s TV ambitions will bear fruit with Turner remains to be seen. The companies have a few early ideas: Refinery29 could hit the red carpet for the \u201cScreen Actors Guild Awards\u201d on TNT or tie in with \u201cFull Frontal with Samantha Bee\u201d on TBS.\n\n\u201cWe currently today don\u2019t have any footprint on television. It\u2019s an incredibly high-impact, high-engagement, high-quality medium that we just really want to be producing content for,\u201d said Justin Stefano, Refinery29\u2019s co-founder and co-CEO.\n\nAs part of the arrangement, Turner has led a new $45 million funding round for Refinery29. The new financing values the digital media company at about $500 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Scripps Networks Interactive also participated in the round, which brings Refinery29\u2019s total fundraising to date to about $125 million. Turner made up more than three-quarters of the latest funding round, said a person familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cMaking an investment like this and developing a partnership like this helps us meet that consumer demand for video outside the traditional television space and really compete effectively across all platforms,\u201d Mr. Levy said.\n\nTurner\u2019s investment in Refinery29 was previously reported by Recode.\n\nThe move is the latest linkup between traditional TV companies, which are on the hunt to boost their digital presence as younger viewers shun the cable bundle, and digital media companies, which are itching to get a piece of the some $70 billion TV ad market.\n\nComcast Corp. \u2019s NBCUniversal, for instance, has invested in digital publishers BuzzFeed and Vox Media, while Walt Disney Co. has a stake in Vice Media.\n\nIn March, Turner led a $15 million investment round in digital media publisher Mashable. The company also announced plans to spend $100 million building out Bleacher Report, the sports website it acquired in 2012.\n\nThe digital media world\u2019s foray into television is largely in its early stages. Vox and NBCU, for instance, are collaborating on an ad sales product, and the digital media company will bring a TV series to A+E Networks-owned cable channel FYI. Vice has taken the plunge with its own cable channel Viceland, in tandem with A+E, which is jointly owned by Disney and Hearst.\n\nRefinery29 says it brings in more than 27 million unique visitors a month to its website and reaches 225 million people across other platforms like Facebook and Snapchat.

The investment round was led by Lerer Hippeau Ventures, the venture-capital firm that helped launch the Huffington Post and BuzzFeed.\n\nComcast Corp. \u2019s NBC News unit also is backing the startup and will serve as its media partner.\n\n\u201cOur talent will appear on NBC and MSNBC and we will collaborate on other projects,\u201d Mr. VandeHei said.\n\nBackers include Emerson Collective, a social justice group headed by Laurene Powell Jobs, wife of Apple Inc. \u2019s late co-founder Steve Jobs, Greycroft Partners and David and Katherine Bradley, owners of the Atlantic and Quartz.\n\nThe publication is to launch in early 2017 and will focus on areas such as tech, health care and business news, and will include some political and media coverage, the people familiar with the matter said.\n\nIts business likely will bear similarities to the Politico Pro subscription model that Mr. VandeHei helped create at Politico, which he co-founded and was chief executive for a time, the people said.\n\n\u2018You just need to produce something people want, need and get addicted to.\u2019 \u2014Jim VandeHei, media entrepreneur\n\nBut the intended audience will be corporate executives and other professionals rather than Washington lobbyists.

He declined to disclose the new venture\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cWe believe\u2014and proved with Politico\u2014that you can build a great media company if you offer content consumers and advertisers truly value delivered the way they truly want it,\u201d Mr. VandeHei said. \u201cYou just need to produce something people want, need and get addicted to. That\u2019s our aim.\u201d\n\nThe challenge will be to break through in a media landscape already crowded with business news offerings from digital and traditional publishers, as well as the trade press. Besides Politico, other media companies such as The Wall Street Journal have launched premium, subscription services aimed at professionals.\n\nMr. VandeHei has hired 17 staffers and aims to have between 50 and 60 employees by the time of the launch. The company will be based in Arlington. Va., and will have offices in New York.\n\nMr. VandeHei will serve as chairman and CEO. Roy Schwartz, Politico\u2019s former chief revenue officer, will be its president. Nicholas Johnston, a former managing editor at Bloomberg LP who helped create a fast-filed news service there called First Word, will be editor in chief.\n\nMike Allen will join the company after his run at Politico ends following November\u2019s election.\n\nAndy Lack, the chairman of NBC News and MSNBC, will serve on the new company\u2019s board, as will Eric Hippeau, a managing partner at Lerer Hippeau Ventures.\n\nThe company will open a new chapter for 45-year-old Mr. VandeHei, who helped launch Politico in 2007 with the backing of Robert Allbritton. The site shook up Washington, D.C., with blanket coverage of all things political, rapid-fire blog posts, morning email blasts and in-depth coverage of elections and legislative happenings. That later paved the way for a move into the events business and high-price subscription services.\n\nBut Mr. VandeHei\u2019s relationship with Mr. Albritton began to sour after he was named CEO of Politico in 2013. The two sparred over the direction of the company and the situation came to a head in late 2015 when Mr. VandeHei pushed for a sale of part or all of the company to German media conglomerate Axel Springer SE, people familiar with the matter said.A sale would have triggered some limited equity options for Mr. VandeHei and co-founder John Harris.\n\nMr. VandeHei would only describe the situation surrounding his departure from Politico as \u201ccomplicated\u201d but acknowledged that equity was an issue.\n\n\u201cI believe in equity for everyone but Robert was the sole owner and had other ideas,\u201d he said, adding that employees in his new company would all receive equity stakes.\n\nIn late January, Mr. VandeHei said he would be departing Politico to start a new venture that would try \u201cto match in a new space the magic and success we pulled off here.\u201d\n\nWrite to Lukas I.

But she said the contract allowed her to launch the new company, Thrive Global, while continuing in her role at the site.\n\nWhen she secured Series A funding for the new venture late last week, she said it had become clear she could no longer continue running Huffington Post. \u201cI really thought I could do both, but as we started building it up, I realized that it really needed my full attention,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIt is important to know when one door closes and another opens, and I felt that moment had arrived.\u201d\n\nMs. Huffington\u2019s continued role at her namesake site\u2014which was acquired by AOL Inc. in 2011 for $315 million\u2014had become unclear after AOL was bought by Verizon Communications Inc. for $4.4 billion last year. The matter appeared put to rest when she signed the new contract, but her future with the site came into question again when she announced two months ago that she would be launching a new venture.\n\nMs. Huffington has published a number of books focusing on health and sleep issues, including \u201cThrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder,\u201d and \u201cThe Sleep Revolution.\u201d She had spent an increasing amount of time this year dedicated to giving lectures on the subjects and less time running the site.\n\nMs. Huffington, a Greek native, rose to U.S. prominence in the 1990s as a conservative political commentator. Her then-husband, Michael Huffington, a billionaire Republican oil heir, ran for the U.S. Senate in California in 1994 but narrowly lost to Dianne Feinstein. After they divorced, Ms. Huffington became more liberal and in 2005 co-founded the Huffington Post along with Kenneth Lerer and Jonah Peretti.\n\nKenneth Lerer and Arianna Huffington at a Huffington Post event in 2010. Photo: Getty Images\n\nThe site helped pioneer digital-only journalism and its success would serve as a template for many digital startups that followed in its wake.\n\nMr. Peretti later founded BuzzFeed with the backing of Mr. Lerer who has become a top venture capitalist for many digital-media companies and is investing in Ms. Huffington\u2019s new venture.\n\n\u201cWhen we started, there was no Facebook, there was no video, no social. It was tech 101, but Arianna saw the possibilities,\u201d said Mr. Lerer. \u201cWithout her marketing genius, her editing and her contacts, none of this would have happened.\u201d\n\nWhen the Huffington Post was sold to AOL five years ago, Ms. Huffington was named president and editor in chief of Huffington Post Media Group, which took on other AOL media properties such as Engadget, TechCrunch, Moviefone and MapQuest.\n\nThe management structure, however, created tension, and by mid-2012, her portfolio was scaled back to only the Huffington Post.\n\nIn recent years, Huffington Post has undergone an aggressive global expansion, launching localized versions of the site in 14 countries, such as Greece, the U.K., France and Mexico.\n\nThe Huffington Post was founded as a liberal alternative to the Drudge Report and quickly rose in prominence as a blogging platform and news aggregator. Ms. Huffington often leveraged her personal relationships to get celebrities and political figures to write columns for the site.\n\n\u201cArianna is a visionary who built The Huffington Post into a truly transformative news platform,\u201d Tim Armstrong, chief executive officer of AOL, said in a statement. \u201cAOL and Verizon are committed to continuing its growth and the groundbreaking work Arianna pioneered.\u201d\n\nArianna Huffington, co-founder and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post, is leaving the digital media outlet to focus on her new startup Thrive Global. Photo: Getty Images for AOL\n\nMs. Huffington\u2019s time running the company wasn\u2019t without controversy.\n\nHuffington Post\u2019s practice of not paying many of its contributors\u2014arguing that they were benefiting from exposure to the site\u2019s large number of visitors\u2014brought criticism. In 2011, the National Writers Union and the News Guild called for a boycott of the site.\n\nDespite regularly drawing more than 100 million unique visitors a month, the site has failed to consistently turn a profit.\n\nIn April, Ms. Huffington raised concerns among staff when she joined the board of Uber, but she said she recused herself from coverage of the ride-sharing business.\n\nThrive Global, which will work with companies to improve the well-being of their employees, is slated to formally launch in November. The company\u2019s Series A funding round was led by Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Mr. Lerer\u2019s fund.\n\nIn a memo, Mr. Armstrong said an interim editorial committee will fill Ms. Huffington\u2019s role while helping search for a new editor in chief. Ms. Huffington said there had been discussions for her to continue in some role, but she instead decided to leave in the next two or three weeks.\n\n\u201cI have been running Huffington Post for 11 years and I couldn\u2019t imagine having another relationship with it,\u201d she said.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications:\n\nThe Huffington Post was co-founded by Arianna Huffington, Kenneth Lerer and Jonah Peretti.

Many say the diversity of the employees in the ad business hasn\u2019t changed enough since then. Photo: Justina Mintz/AMC via AP\n\nRecent incidents of alleged sexist and racist behavior among advertising executives has thrust Madison Avenue into the limelight, raising questions once again about the number of women and minorities in marketing positions of power.\n\nBroad government data indicate that African-Americans and Hispanics are underrepresented among the advertising and public relations industries, but more granular data can be tougher to come by. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission collects demographic information annually from each company about its workforce in the U.S., including data on race and gender. But companies are not required to publicly disclose those filings.\n\nMarc Bendick Jr., a labor economist and workplace discrimination expert who has studied the advertising industry, says the lack of women and minorities is quite clear.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the face of the advertising industry in 1960s as portrayed on the program \u2018Mad Men\u2019 and the face of the industry today, they look shockingly similar,\u201d said Mr. Bendick. \u201cMany industries in the country have moved on a lot since the 1960s\u2026it\u2019s quite amazing [advertising] has been such a holdout.\u201d\n\nBut how has the composition of the advertising workforce changed\u2014or not changed\u2014over that time? The lack of comprehensive data makes it harder to hold major advertising companies accountable for their initiatives to improve diversity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a moment where the public is seeking increased information about the employment practices and composition of large companies,\u201d said Fatima Goss Graves, senior vice president for program at the National Women\u2019s Law Center. \u201cCompanies can\u2019t be afraid to report bad news. Bad news might mean you have to identify clear plans going forward for the future.\u201d\n\nMany high-profile technology companies have started releasing annual \u201cdiversity reports\u201d in the last few years that detail the composition of their workforces, showing that the majority of their employees are male and white or Asian. The release of detailed information often comes with tech firms\u2019 stated goals for improvement and the promise of future updates on the data.\n\n\u2018You can\u2019t improve on what you don\u2019t measure.\u2019 \u2014Kat Gordon, founder of the 3% Conference\n\nMajor advertising companies have also highlighted diversity as a priority and invested in internal resources and partnerships to help promote diversity. But the information they disclose is typically less robust than the diversity reports from Silicon Valley. Major ad companies do release some top-line data, but they all disclose different slices of information that make it impossible to compare across companies. It\u2019s also rare to get data broken down for the creative departments, a significant omission given the criticisms of the lack of women involved in coming up with ad campaigns.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t improve on what you don\u2019t measure,\u201d said Kat Gordon, the founder of the 3% Conference, a movement dedicated to building a business case for more female creative directors in advertising.\n\nThe spotlight is on the industry after the chief executive of WPP \u2019s J. Walter Thompson agency Gustavo Martinez resigned this week following a lawsuit by a female employee accusing him of a pattern of racist and sexist behavior, including jokes about rape and demeaning comments about African-Americans and Jews. Mr. Martinez has denied the allegations.\n\nIn the wake of these accusations and a slew of advertisements in recent years that have come under scrutiny for their lack of sensitivity, CMO Today set out to compile the data on gender and race that is disclosed by the major ad holding companies, to try to better understand the state of the industry decades after the days of \u201cMad Men.\u201d\n\nBroad Industry\n\nAccording to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Current Population Survey, African-Americans accounted for 5.3% of the employees in advertising, public relations and related services in the U.S. in 2015, down from 7.1% in 2005. That\u2019s less than in the total U.S. workforce, where African-Americans accounted for 11.7% of employed Americans in 2015.\n\n\u20185.3%\u2019 \u2014Employees in advertising, public relations and related services in the U.S. who are African-American\n\nHispanics\u2014which made up 16.4% of the nation\u2019s overall workforce last year\u2014accounted for 11.7% of the advertising industry\u2019s jobs last year, up from 7.4% a decade earlier. Asians made up 6% of employees in advertising in 2015\u2014roughly in line with their percentage of the overall employed U.S. population\u2014up from 3.6% a decade earlier.\n\nThe percentage of women in the advertising industry has declined slightly from 52% a decade ago to 49% last year, while the overall employed population in the country has hovered around 46%. However, the BLS doesn\u2019t break out gender by job title or role for the advertising industry.\n\nWPP, the holding company that owns JWT where the CEO was replaced this week by a woman, disclosed in its 2014-2015 sustainability report that 26% of its full-time employees in the U.S. and U.K. and 19% of senior managers in those regions were from ethnic minorities. Those are slight improvements from 22% of total employees and 13% of senior managers in 2007, when WPP began reporting ethnic diversity in its U.K. and U.S. businesses.

Often made by Vice itself, these spots will frequently be longer than a typical 30-second ad and will be tailored specifically for the network, whose other owner, A+E, is jointly owned by Walt Disney Co. and Hearst Corp.\n\nA TRESemm\u00e9 ad has a Vice employee discussing a digital campaign for the brand. Photo: Vice\n\n\u201cWe are trying to displace the clutter by injecting some humanity and authenticity,\u201d said Eddy Moretti, co-president of Viceland and Vice\u2019s chief creative officer. \u201cIf we create a user experience that is more engaging than what else is on the dial, people won\u2019t flip.\u201d\n\nVice, which was valued last fall at nearly $4.5 billion in a recent funding round, isn\u2019t alone in identifying that the barrage of traditional ads that appear on most cable channels are a turnoff for viewers, particularly younger ones who have grown up with Netflix, DVRs and ad-blocking software.\n\nTime Warner Inc. \u2019s Turner Broadcasting has begun testing 50% lighter ad loads on its truTV and TNT networks, while launching a program of native ads to encourage brands to bring or create their own content that might stretch across the whole commercial break. Viacom Inc., which owns youth-focused channels like MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, had been carrying particularly heavy ad loads, but has reduced those across its portfolio by about a minute per hour over the past year, according to the company.\n\n\u201cConsumers are basically stating that the experience needs to be a little bit better,\u201d said Donna Speciale, president of ad sales for Turner Broadcasting. \u201cWe are taking it very seriously.\u201d\n\nVice arrived at its strategy from its experience in digital media, where brands have long experimented with native ads. While such ads are \u201ca little bit more expensive\u201d than traditional advertising, the price difference is \u201cnot egregious,\u201d said Andrew Creighton, Vice\u2019s president. A typical 30-second spot on cable TV costs about $15 per thousand views, according to research firm SQAD.\n\nSkeptics wonder whether Vice\u2019s model has much growth potential, given not every advertiser can pull off these projects. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether you can gain critical mass to support an entire network this way,\u201d said Chris Geraci, president of national broadcast at media buyer Omnicom Media Group.\n\nMoreover, it is a challenging time to be launching a cable network, with pay TV cord-cutting on the rise and all channels\u2014especially small ones\u2014facing the prospect of brutal carriage fee negotiations in coming years with big cable and satellite distributors.\n\nSo far, most of Vice\u2019s ad partners are still in the early stages of planning how to do business with Vice. Bank of America Corp. had previously sponsored the Vice News Web series \u201cBusiness of Life,\u201d which covered topics like why college was so expensive. Bank of America, which supplied relevant content on financial literacy that runs adjacent to the shows, will be bringing the series to Viceland in a few months.\n\nOne custom ad on Viceland paid for by Unilever will feature a Vice employee talking about a digital-ad campaign she came up with for the company\u2019s TRESemm\u00e9 hair-product brand.\n\nAnother one, paid for by e-mail-marketing service MailChimp, will feature a Vice employee interviewing a local business owner and MailChimp user in Brooklyn\u2019s Williamsburg section, just down the street from Vice\u2019s headquarters.\n\nThose ads will run across Viceland\u2019s prime-time lineup, which includes shows like \u201cWeediquette,\u201d \u201cGaycation\u201d and \u201cF*ck, That\u2019s Delicious.\u201d They were produced by a new segment of the company, a 30-person unit called Vice Labs.\n\nAnne Finucane, vice chairman of Bank of America, isn\u2019t expecting big ratings from Viceland right off the bat. \u201cFor new networks starting out, I\u2019m not sure that we can expect high ratings,\u201d she said. \u201cThe value of this is multiplatform.\u201d\n\nThe channel has asked measurement specialist Nielsen\u2014and Nielsen has agreed\u2014to refrain from making its ratings public for the first six months to allow it to experiment outside the glare of media scrutiny.\n\nWrite to Keach Hagey at Keach.Hagey@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Vice Media Launches Its Own Cable-TV Channel"}

Armed with a $200 million investment from Comcast, the company has been ramping up its video ambitions markedly \u2013 with television in its sights \u2013 and has aggressively embraced distribution on social media platforms.\n\nVox Media Chief Executive Jim Bankoff touched on those initiatives when he joined The Wall Street Journal for the debut WSJ Media Mix podcast.\n\nSo when it comes to TV-style programming, what will Vox, which runs sites like the Verge, Racked, Eater, SB Nation and Curbed, produce? Maybe a Racked fashion show on Bravo? Or an Eater restaurant competition?\n\nWell, Vox announced its first offering at its NewFront event Wednesday: a series for A+E Networks-owned cable channel FYI focusing on real estate in collaboration with its website Curbed.\n\nMr. Bankoff says Vox is interested in \u201ccreating new types of products that could be sold to other distributors, whether that\u2019s programming to Amazon, Netflix, Hulu or cable networks.\u201d\n\nMr. Bankoff also argued that media companies, many of whom derive the lion\u2019s share of their audiences from Facebook, aren\u2019t slaves to the platform as it expands its Instant Articles program. \u201cWe\u2019re not working for Facebook.

Photo: The Verge\n\nComcast Corp. \u2019s NBCUniversal agreed to make a $200 million strategic investment in the digital media company Vox Media in August. Now the partners are getting to the strategic part.\n\nStarting this week, NBCU will run Vox\u2019s custom ad products on its digital properties, and both companies\u2019 sales teams will start selling packages to marketers that include these ads.\n\nWith this new initiative, dubbed Concert, Vox and NBCU say they are aiming high. For starters, it\u2019s a scale play. The two companies are talking up their ability to run ads on roughly 20 sites, ranging from NBC.com to SyFy.com to TheVerge.com, which collectively reach over 150 million people a month, according to comScore data.\n\nFor example, an advertiser looking to target foodies might consider an ad buy that includes TV spots on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday,\u201d commercials during various Bravo series and ads on Eater.com, said Linda Yaccarino, NBCUniversal\u2019s chairman of advertising sales and client partnerships.\n\nIn addition, Vox and NBCU are talking up this collaboration as essentially the start of a premium, brand-friendly ad network\u2014one that blends bold, high-impact creative with ads that work well on mobile devices and load fast. According to Jim Bankoff, chairman and chief executive of Vox Media, this approach is crucial as digital media companies angle for a bigger chunk of traditional marketers\u2019 ad budgets while also trying to tamp down the rise of ad blocking.\n\n\u201cWe see a real void in the market for quality ad building in digital,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole point of brand building is to build trust. It\u2019s impossible to do that with ads that suck.\u201d\n\nOver time, Vox is hoping to get more big media partners to adopt its custom ads. NBCU\u2019s minority investment last year valued Vox at about $1 billion, people familiar with the situation said at the time.\n\nFor this deal, besides better creative, a big focus will be helping advertisers apply their own data to target ads across a wide variety of properties, Mr. Bankoff said. That should theoretically help NBCU and Vox better compete with companies that specialize in data-driven, \u201cprogrammatic\u201d ads.\n\nMs. Yaccarino wouldn\u2019t commit to what percentage of ad inventory on NBCU\u2019s sites will feature Vox-built creative. But the goal is to find out which ads work best for advertisers, and to run more of them, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a brand new product, but we want to evolve it and scale it as much as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea here is these ads are big, bold and beautiful, and you don\u2019t have to worry about fraud, and you don\u2019t have to worry about viewability.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "NBCU and Vox Will Start Selling Ads on Each Other\u2019s Sites"}

The company also intends to experiment with animated content, as well as editorial focused on the intersection of sports and pop culture, such as music and fashion, he said.\n\nThe $100 million investment is substantial, considering that Turner, a unit of Time Warner Inc., reportedly paid about $175 million to acquire Bleacher Report four years ago. Back then, the company was largely known for churning out search-driven content\u2014not unlike Demand Media \u2014and for featuring content from a large network of bloggers, many of whom were not necessarily professional journalists.\n\nBut since then, Turner has worked to revamp Bleacher Report\u2019s image and strategy, hiring the likes of sports journalist Howard Beck away from the New York Times, while also relentlessly promoting the brand during Turner\u2019s sports broadcasts, like its ongoing coverage of this year\u2019s NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament.\n\n\u201cWhen we bought it, it really was a brand,\u201d said Mr. Levy. \u201cWhether it was really something with [complete] journalistic integrity, you can debate that one way or another. But we truly saw it as a brand. Turner wasn\u2019t a sports brand. We sort of needed a sports destination media brand.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you ask people in the industry, nobody is thinking Bleacher Report is a bunch of bloggers anymore,\u201d he added.\n\nHaving a digital sports destination to serve as a promotional platform helped Turner in negotiations with sports leagues over TV rights, Mr. Levy said, and helped in negotiations with advertisers, who increasingly want ad campaigns that include multimedia elements.\n\nMore recently, Bleacher Report\u2014like many born-on-the-Web brands\u2014has also embraced distributing content across social media. According to comScore, BleacherReport.com reached 32.3 million unique visitors in February, down 9% versus last year. However, the site boasts of 2 million followers on Instagram, 2.26 million on Twitter and over 4 million on Facebook. (It has not yet made YouTube as much of a priority.)\n\nAccording to Turner, Bleacher Report content generates 28 million social interactions, such as likes and shares, a month on various social platforms, and its video content accounts for 60 million views a week.\n\nBleacher Report pulled in $100 million in ad revenue last year, said a person familiar with the matter.\n\nPhoto: Bleacher Report\n\nSteve Minichini, chief executive at the ad buying firm AboveNation Media, said that Turner has smartly tapped into a new breed of sports addict, one who in this era of DraftKings and data-obsessed fandom, is constantly seeking out sports news and community chatter\u2014and not just from traditional media players.\n\n\u201cThese people want that constant engagement,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for male-dominated brands, that\u2019s attractive. And I think today [Bleacher Report] is a more a premium ad vehicle than it was a few years ago.\u201d\n\nThe financial commitment to Bleacher Report is just the latest in a string of digital investments by Turner and its parent company Time Warner. Last week CNN, which is owned by Turner, announced it would invest $20 million this year in its digital products. Time Warner is also increasing its investment in the independent digital publisher Mashable, according to the Information.\n\nMr. Levy said this level of investment in digital media is crucial for big media companies looking to grow while facing a rapidly changing landscape.\n\n\u201cFrom the top down, we are in a position of strength and are making investments in core and new properties as we aim toward sustained growth,\u201d Mr. Levy said. \u201cAs TV tries to act more like digital, and digital tries to act more like TV, they are starting to meet in the middle. And we think media companies that have a TV presence have a competitive advantage because of our ability to cross-promote\u2014and our premium content.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Turner Plans to Spend $100 Million Expanding Bleacher Report"}

Walter Thompson. Photo: D Dipasupil/Getty Images for AWXI\n\nGustavo Martinez, chief executive of ad agency J. Walter Thompson, has resigned in the wake of a discrimination lawsuit accusing him of a pattern of sexist and racist behavior.\n\nWPP PLC, the parent company of JWT, said in a statement Thursday that Mr. Martinez resigned \u201cby mutual agreement\u201d for the \u201cbest interest\u201d of JWT.\n\nMr. Martinez is being succeeded by Tamara Ingram, a WPP executive who is one of the highest-ranking women in the advertising business.\n\nLast week, Erin Johnson, JWT\u2019s chief communications officer, filed a lawsuit against JWT and Mr. Martinez, alleging that the executive engaged in an \u201cunending stream of racist and sexist comments as well as unwanted touching and other unlawful conduct.\u201d Ms. Johnson said his behavior amounted to gender discrimination and a violation of her civil rights.\n\nMr. Martinez has denied the allegations. \u201cI want to assure our clients and my colleagues that there is absolutely no truth to these outlandish allegations and I am confident that this will be proven in court,\u201d Mr. Martinez said in a statement provided by WPP last week.\n\nWhen asked for comment Thursday, Mr. Martinez referred requests to JWT\u2019s public-relations firm, Finsbury. Finsbury declined to comment beyond WPP\u2019s statement.\n\nJWT is one of the biggest ad companies in the world and works on behalf of marketers such as Unilever PLC, Ford Motor Co. and HSBC Holdings PLC. The allegations against Mr. Martinez are among a series of incidences in recent years that cast the advertising world in an unflattering light and highlight the lack of diversity that still exists in the advertising and marketing business.\n\nMs. Ingram, Mr. Martinez\u2019s successor, oversaw WPP\u2019s Procter & Gamble business for almost a decade before she was elevated to chief client team officer last year, giving her oversight of the company\u2019s top 45 clients, which represent about one-third of WPP\u2019s annual revenue.\n\nMr. Martinez, a native of Argentina who became chief executive of JWT in 2015, allegedly made offensive remarks about African-Americans and Jews, including referring to personnel at airports as \u201cblack monkeys\u201d and \u201capes,\u201d according to the lawsuit. He also allegedly told a reporter that he disliked New York\u2019s Westchester County because \u201cthere are too many Jews.\u201d\n\nThe suit alleges a hostile work environment including claims by Ms. Johnson that Mr. Martinez grabbed her by the throat or the back of her neck on multiple occasions. It also alleges that the CEO \u201cpublicly asked questions about which female staff member he should rape.\u201d\n\nThe suit alleges that Ms. Johnson complained repeatedly to JWT and WPP executives in writing and verbally about Mr. Martinez\u2019s behavior but nothing was done to fix the situation. Ms. Johnson was placed on paid leave by the company last month, according to the suit, after her lawyer sent a letter saying that she had been subject to \u201cunlawful discrimination and retaliation.\u201d\n\nMs. Johnson\u2019s lawyers amended the complaint earlier this week and sought to enter into evidence a photocopy of a disc that contains video footage from a May 2015 meeting in Miami in which Mr. Martinez allegedly made offensive remarks.\n\nWPP\u2019s law firm Davis & Gilbert LLP on Thursday objected to the video being submitted as evidence because it contains \u201chighly confidential and proprietary\u201d information. In a letter to the judge, the law firm said Ms. Johnson has the only copy of the full video, which it hasn\u2019t seen.\n\nMs. Johnson\u2019s lawyer couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment on Thursday.\n\nA JWT spokesman said the investigations into the allegations are continuing.\n\nEarlier this week, WPP hired Bettina Plevan of Proskauer Rose LLP to conduct an independent investigation into the allegations. Ms. Plevan is a partner in Proskauer Rose\u2019s labor and employment law department and has handled high-profile sexual harassment cases such as representing Meritor Savings Bank in the remand of a Supreme Court Case and the reversal of a $4 million lawsuit against Penthouse magazine.\n\nWrite to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com and Nathalie Tadena at nathalie.tadena@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "J.

Walter Thompson, whose clients include Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Macy\u2019s Inc., was sued for alleged discrimination by a female subordinate who accused him of an \u201cunending stream of racist and sexist comments, as well as unwanted touching.\u201d He denied the allegations in a statement provided by the agency. JWT, which was also named in the suit along with parent WPP PLC, said it was reviewing the matter and would respond at the appropriate time.\n\nInterpublic Group of Cos. recently fired the top executive at its Campbell Ewald agency days after finding out about an email from an agency employee that invited colleagues to celebrate \u201cGhetto Day\u201d with malt liquor, drugs and prostitution. Interpublic didn\u2019t give a reason for the firing at the time, and the executive didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. A person familiar with the matter said Interpublic learned of the email only after it had been published in the trade press and the employee who sent it had been fired.\n\nOther controversies have stemmed from ads themselves. One, in a 2015 Bloomingdale\u2019s holiday catalog, was headlined \u201cSpike Your Best Friend\u2019s Eggnog When They\u2019re Not Looking,\u201d and featured a woman laughing with her head turned as a young man gave her a sidelong glance. The luxury chain, owned by Macy\u2019s, apologized for the ad, which some critics interpreted as promoting date rape. In 2014, Sony Corp. pulled an innuendo-laden online PlayStation video ad in which a female doctor asks \u201cHow many times did you do it yesterday?\u201d It acted after bloggers and others criticized the ad as sexist.\n\nAccording to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, African-Americans, which represent 11.7% of the U.S. workforce, accounted for 5.3% of the employees in advertising, public relations and related services in 2015, down from 7.1% in 2005. The industry has been more successful in recruiting Hispanics\u201416.4% of the nation\u2019s overall workforce; they accounted for 11.7% of the industry\u2019s jobs last year, up from 7.4% a decade earlier.\n\nThe percentage of women has stayed fairly steady at about half of the industry\u2019s employees over the past 10 years, largely in line with the overall population. But ad executives say relatively few women can be found in the upper creative ranks where advertising campaigns are forged.\n\n\u201cThe numbers show it; we have a real problem\u201d with the lack of women in creative posts, said Susan Credle, global chief creative officer of Interpublic agency FCB and one of the industry\u2019s highest-ranking female creative executives.\n\nWhile the lack of diversity in Hollywood and Silicon Valley has attracted national attention recently, the ad industry has been grappling with the issue for decades.\n\n\u201cDiversity is a tough one. We have spent a lot of time and attention and resources and have very little to show for it as an industry,\u201d said Bob Liodice, chief executive of the Association of National Advertisers, which represents many of the nation\u2019s biggest brands. While ethnic diversity in the industry is \u201cvery poor,\u201d he said the ad business has done a \u201cpretty good job\u201d with gender diversity.\n\nInterpublic, which started formal diversity and inclusion programs in 2005, \u201chas made significant strides in increasing diversity at senior levels across all minority groups and among women,\u201d said CEO Michael Roth.\n\nEven so, the lack of diversity worries some big advertisers. \u201cI am sick and tired, as a client, of sitting in agency meetings with a whole bunch of white straight males talking to me about how we are going to sell our brands that are bought 85% by women,\u201d Brad Jakeman, a top PepsiCo Inc. executive, said at a conference last year to a roomful of the nation\u2019s largest advertisers.\n\nIn last week\u2019s lawsuit, Erin Johnson, JWT\u2019s chief communications officer, alleges that CEO Gustavo Martinez \u201cpublicly asked questions about which female staff member he should rape.\u201d\n\nThe suit also claims that Mr. Martinez, a native of Argentina, made offensive remarks about African-Americans and Jews, such as referring to personnel at an airport as \u201cblack monkeys\u201d and \u201capes\u201dand telling a reporter, during a meeting Ms. Johnson attended, that he disliked living in New York\u2019s suburban Westchester County because there were \u201ctoo many Jews.\u201d The suit says she complained repeatedly to executives at JWT and WPP, but nothing was done. She was put on paid leave last month.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Martinez said: \u201cI believe I lead this company with a collaborative and collegial style and did not create the kind of working environment that has been described in the complaint. I welcome the opportunity for the truth to come out.\u201d\n\nJWT client Kimberly-Clark declined to comment. Macy\u2019s said: \u201cWe have no advertising agency of record; we work with many agencies, including JWT.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need a lawsuit like this to break this issue wide open, because it will never change,\u201d said Cindy Gallop, CEO of consulting firm IfWeRanTheWorld/MakeLoveNotPorn and a founder of agency BBH New York. \u201cThe reason this keeps happening in the industry is because the business is controlled at the top by white guys.\u201d\n\nLast year, in a survey of 328 women in advertising, 23% of the respondents reported that they had personally experienced or witnessed sexual harassment; just 8% said the responsible party was punished. The survey was commissioned by the 3% Conference, a movement dedicated to building a business case for more female creative directors.\n\nNancy Hill, CEO of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, responding to the survey, said employers should take discrimination or sexual harassment claims seriously, fully investigate them and deal swiftly with offenders.\n\nWPP, which has provided snapshots of its workforce, has said that 26% of its U.S. and U.K. employees in 2014 were minorities and that women accounted for 31% of executive leaders within its operating companies and 46% of senior managers overall. It didn\u2019t break down the numbers by ethnic groups or specific responsibilities. WPP says it has initiated a number of programs to develop female leaders and help close the gender gap.\n\nWrite to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com and Nathalie Tadena at nathalie.tadena@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Lawsuit Sparks Soul-Searching on Madison Avenue Over Diversity"}

Some say their Instant Articles currently generate the same amount of ad revenue on a per-view basis as pageviews on their own mobile properties.\n\nThat\u2019s an important milestone for the program, which allows publishers to host content directly on Facebook instead of posting links to draw users back to their own websites.\n\nPublishers are still testing and evaluating Instant Articles, and the ability to generate meaningful revenue from it may prompt them to post more of their content to the social network.\n\nFacebook in December relaxed rules dictating the volume and type of advertising that could appear in Instant Articles after publishers said they were finding it difficult to generate revenue from the program.\n\n\u201cA lot has changed,\u201d said Joe Speiser, co-founder of LittleThings.com, which publishes stories and videos optimized for social sharing. \u201cThe biggest stumbling block with Instant Articles was that we were making less there than with visits to our own site. We are now seeing parity with our mobile Web version,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Speiser said the most effective change was perhaps the most obvious one: more ads per article. Other publishers agree.\n\n\u201cThe changes definitely had a positive effect. The greater ad load has probably had the biggest impact for us\u201d, said Joe Alicata, vice president of revenue product and operations at Vox Media. Mr. Alicata declined to comment on whether Vox Media is seeing ad revenue parity between Instant Articles and its own mobile website.\n\nBusiness Insider has only been posting select pieces of content to Instant Articles for the past four weeks, but the business-focused online publisher said it\u2019s pleased with the ad revenue it\u2019s generated from the platform so far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised to see the monetization is strong so. It\u2019s every bit as good as on our own site\u201d, said Business Insider President Julie Hansen.\n\nMeanwhile, news and entertainment site Mic said it now publishes 100% of its content to Instant Articles, largely because it\u2019s able to \u201cmonetize\u201d that content at a similar rate to its own mobile and desktop web traffic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much 1 to 1 across those platforms. There\u2019s no downside for us [with Instant Articles],\u201d said Mic\u2019s chief strategy officer, Cory Haik.\n\nPublishers are entitled to 100% of revenue generated from ads in Instant Articles, provided they sell and serve the ads themselves. Publishers keep a 70% cut if they\u2019d rather have Facebook sell ads on their behalf through its mobile ad network, the Facebook Audience Network.\n\nBusiness Insider has so far relied on entirely on Facebook to sell advertising into its Instant Articles, but Ms. Hansen said it may soon be able to generate more ad revenue from Instant Articles than it can from its own mobile website by selling some ad inventory directly to advertisers and letting Facebook sell the rest.\n\nVox Media has already adopted that strategy, using its internal staff to sell some of its Instant Articles ad space directly to advertisers and passing the rest to Facebook to sell. It\u2019s been using Facebook\u2019s Audience Network since \u201clate last year\u201d, Mr. Alicata said.\n\nIndeed, some publishers cited the Audience Network as a major reason Instant Articles are proving more lucrative, even after Facebook has taken its 30% commission. Ad prices or \u201cCPMs\u201d through the network have been increasing, they said, and so has the \u201cfill rate,\u201d meaning few ad impressions are going unsold.\n\nOne early question publishers had about the Instant Articles program was whether Facebook might be able to help them monetize their mobile audiences more successfully than they can themselves.\n\nPublisher feedback suggests that might be the case, but the question remains whether they\u2019re receptive to the trade-off that increased revenue comes packaged with \u2014 which is more reliance on Facebook.\n\nFacebook declined to comment on any CPM increases publishers have seen through the Audience Network, but said it plans to continue to listen to publisher feedback to improve Instant Articles further.\n\n\u201cDirect feedback from our partners has been crucial to developing Instant Articles,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe\u2019re working with publishers to make advertising within Instant Articles simple and valuable, and we\u2019re excited to hear that the latest round of updates has been helpful.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Facebook\u2019s Instant Articles Advertising Fixes Win Over Publishers"}

CNN plans to hire more than 200 new staffers, including a mix of journalists, video producers, analytics and audience development experts and mobile product developers.\n\nHowever, as a result of these changes, more than 50 CNN staffers are set to lose their jobs. This group will include people who have focused on CNN\u2019s traditional desktop website, several generalist reporters and editors as well as employees from the company\u2019s product, technology and operations, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nMr. Morse didn\u2019t mention any competitors, but hinted that while CNN\u2019s digital audience has long been a strong point, the company sees \u2018native\u2019 Web brands such as BuzzFeed and Mic.com as a serious long term threat.\n\n\u201cThe world has changed,\u201d he said. \u201cScale alone is not enough. We can\u2019t fight the last war. The one for the desktop homepage--we already won.\u201d He said the model of digital news that tries to \u201creplicate a wire service\u201d is falling out of date, as native digital companies experiment with other types of journalism. \u201cWe need to be as nimble and digitally savvy.\u201d\n\nThat means building a team focused on mobile products, Mr. Morse said, such as a soon-to-be-launched mobile feed called \u201cMoney Stream,\u201d which will let consumers \u201cfollow\u201d different companies to create a personalized content experience. (This product is inspired by a similar one built for sports fans by Turner sibling Bleacher Report.) Plus, CNN plans to develop a 30-person team focused on using data for audience development.\n\nIn addition, with the new crop of hires CNN plans to build out a group solely focused on distributing and customizing content on other platforms, such as Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat Discover.\n\nSome of the new funding and hires will also be directed at expanding CNN\u2019s digital content verticals, including health and style. This will follow the same model CNN has employed over the past two years for CNN Politics and CNN Money. Since 2014, the company has hired a slew of prominent journalists (such as Rachel Smolkin, formerly managing editor of Politico, and former New York Times media reporter Brian Stelter) and started producing more original content.\n\nThat has resulted in more traffic and ad revenue, said Mr. Morse. For example, based on comScore internal data, since August of 2014, CNN\u2019s politics section has seen its audience jump from 8 million unique visitors to over 25 million as of January (the 2016 presidential race may have helped as well).\n\nThough he declined to provide ad revenue specifics, Mr. Morse said CNN brought in new advertisers such as Audi, Novartis, SAP, Microsoft and Fidelity as a result of the two expanded verticals.\n\n\u201cBy every metric, we have an incredibly successful, profitable digital business,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "CNN to Pump $20 Million Into Digital Expansion"}

It takes me longer to scroll past a video than three seconds, and they count that as a view.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Responding to this claim, a Facebook spokeswoman said, \u201cIn News Feed, if you have stayed on a video for at least three seconds, it signals to us that you are not simply scrolling through [the] feed and you\u2019ve shown intent to watch that video.\u201d\n\nCMO TODAY: The snowboarding video featured your Jeep rather prominently. Why not call up Jeep and have them sponsor it?\n\nMR. NEISTAT: I was not paid by Jeep or anyone for that, it just happens to be my car. Look, if I had turned the dial two degrees to the left, I think the value to Jeep could have been a hundred fold. If I thought for a second that we lived in a world where I could call up an agency or call up a company and say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to do this right now, do you want to be a part of it?\u201d -- that they could get me an answer and a budget within an hour -- it would have happened. The reality is that would have taken two months to do. They are big, slow-moving sloths, these companies. I think they miss a lot of opportunities because of it. That said, there\u2019s no doubt about it that I drove a tremendous amount of value to it, but they also make a cool car.\n\nCMO TODAY: How can companies make good branded content?\n\nMR. NEISTAT: What\u2019s required is giving full agency to the creator to make something. There\u2019s such a tremendous amount of risk in that from the client\u2019s perspective. At the same time, from the creator\u2019s perspective, the more heavy handed you are in what I can do creatively, the more limited I am. This is all predicated on the fact that a client is approaching a creator because of what that creator has done with his or her own creativity. So you see how those two ideas are at odds right from the inception point. Finding creators that companies believe in and can work with is incredibly challenging, and that\u2019s step one.\n\nCMO TODAY: You\u2019ve made videos for big brands like Nike. How do you decide who to work with?\n\nMR. NEISTAT: It means saying no a lot. I very recently had a six-figure offer from a fast food company. I had to say no to that. There\u2019s no way I could have maintained the integrity of my content, having done the kind of branded content for a fast-food company that was being asked of me. My choice there was binary. It was: say yes and sacrifice what\u2019s taken me years and years to build, in some part. Or say no, and say goodbye to what would have been a fantastic paycheck for me that would have enabled me to create so much more content.\n\nCMO TODAY: The mobile video space is so crowded, particularly since the rise of Snapchat. Why create Beme?\n\nMR. NEISTAT: The goal of that platform is that I still think that there\u2019s no place in the market where I can share little glimpses of things that I see that I find interesting. Sometimes there\u2019s something dynamic like me getting a weird meal on an airplane. This is not a YouTube video, and this is not necessarily a Snapchat message. I\u2019m not going to create a tweet about it. But this is something interesting that maybe other people would be interested in sharing, so I Beme it. What separates what is a Beme from everything else is that there\u2019s no review and there\u2019s no preview. When you capture, the screen goes black, so you\u2019re literally just capturing what\u2019s in front of you to the degree where the software keeps your eyes on the subject. You\u2019re not staring through your phone. With that, it\u2019s just meant to share what you see in the most literal way possible.\n\nWrite to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com and Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Facebook\u2019s Video Tactics are Underhanded, YouTuber Casey Neistat Says"}

Photo: Facebook\n\nFacebook is changing the advertising policies for its Instant Articles platform, after publishers said restrictions made it too difficult for them to generate revenue from content they posted to the social network\u2019s new feature.\n\nFacebook said on Wednesday that it will allow publishers to include more advertising in each article and to sell Facebook-only ad campaigns to marketers if they wish.\n\nPublishers also will have the option to highlight and link to specific content hosted on their own sites from the \u201crelated articles\u201d section at the bottom of Instant Articles templates, including branded or sponsored posts.\n\nMichael Reckhow, Facebook\u2019s Instant Articles product manager, said the company is making the tweaks in response to feedback it gleaned from publishers. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to listen to publishers about what they want from Instant Articles, and we\u2019re going to continue to do this. This is one step forward but we will continue to listen,\u201d Mr. Reckhow said.\n\nInstant Articles, which rolled out to all iPhone users in October, allows media companies to publish content directly to Facebook instead of posting links on the social-media site to draw users back to their own websites. Some 100 publishers are now using Instant Articles on a daily basis to distribute content, while about 300 are enrolled.\n\nThe changes are expected to go into effect for all Instant Articles publishing partners by the end of the week. The product is still in its infancy, but one early complaint from media companies was that they could only place one ad for every 500 words they published in an Instant Article. Now, Facebook is reducing that threshold to one ad for every 350 words.\n\n\u201cBased on feedback we\u2019ve had from publishers, they need additional ads in Instant Articles to match the number of ads they have on their websites,\u201d Mr. Reckhow said.\n\nAnother challenge for publishers was that they weren\u2019t permitted to sell Facebook-only campaigns, but were instead required to package Instant Articles ad space with other inventory across their websites or other properties. Facebook is removing that restriction, which could allow publishers to pitch Instant Articles ads to marketers at a premium, if they wish.\n\nMr. Reckhow said that limitation was in place because Facebook wanted to avoid \u201cconfusion in the marketplace with different sales teams selling Facebook inventory,\u201d but said it now believes advertisers grasp the difference between ads in Instant Articles and those appearing elsewhere across the social network.\n\nIn another new feature, Facebook said it would give publishers the ability to manually control the links to other articles that appear at the bottom of Instant Articles templates. This will enable them to link out to sponsored content or other paid experiences on their own websites. Publishers won\u2019t be permitted to host sponsored content directly within Instant Articles on Facebook, however.\n\nFinally, to further ensure publishers are generating as much revenue as possible from Instant Articles, Facebook said it is launching a tool to automatically place ads within content for every 350 words. The feature will ensure maximum ad load is reached for each Instant Article.\n\nPublishers were \u201cleaving money on the table by under-serving ads,\u201d Mr. Reckhow said. Publishers said they welcome the changes and hope Facebook\u2019s Instant Articles product and the ad opportunities associated with it continue to evolve.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to see the Facebook team working with media partners and really wanting to understand what we need to be successful, and what our advertisers need,\u201d said Joe Alicata, vice president of revenue product and operations at Vox Media Inc.\n\nJoe Speiser, co-founder of LittleThings.com, said the changes likely will drive his company to post more of its content directly to the social network. LittleThings.com publishes feel-good stories that are optimized for social sharing, and already generates around 80% of its website traffic from Facebook, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at how we can increase the amount we\u2019re publishing to Instant Articles,\u201d Mr. Speiser said. \u201cThis is a big enough change that we feel comfortable testing a bigger percentage of our content.\u201d\n\nMr. Reckhow added that Facebook continues to see \u201creally good results\u201d in terms of user engagement, especially with the volume of shares Instant Articles receive.\n\n\u201cPeople want to give their friends the same experience they had,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you had a good experience you\u2019re more likely to want your friends to experience the same thing. If something loads slowly and there are ads obscuring the content, perhaps they don\u2019t want to subject their friends to that.\u201d\n\nMr. Reckhow said Instant Articles are ranked by the same criteria as other content in the newsfeed, including how long users spend with it and how often it is shared. As a result, Instant Articles could be prioritized over links to publishers\u2019 sites.\n\n\u201cInstant Articles earn distribution based on providing a really good experience,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications:\n\nSome 100 publishers are now using Instant Articles to distribute content on a daily basis, while about 300 are enrolled.

Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.\n\nHyper was launched in August by a small team of entrepreneurs in Berlin, Germany, including co-founder Markus Gilles. The app is currently available only on iPads, but the plan is to roll it out to Apple and Android mobile devices in the near future, as well as a version built for connected TV, said Mr. Gilles, who will continue to run Hyper from Berlin.\n\nThe thinking behind Hyper, explained Mr. Gilles, is that there is ever more high-quality video being produced each day, but it\u2019s hard for consumers to find. And the way many people do discover video\u2014via streams in social networks\u2014can be overwhelming or poorly timed.\n\nInstead, Hyper packages a collection of top video clips together each day. While Hyper does employ some proprietary technology to help sift through and categorize videos from the Web, the clips featured each day are selected human editors\u2014a factor that the app\u2019s creators see as a key differentiator.\n\n\u201cThat [editorial oversight is] something an algorithm can\u2019t do and is extremely valuable to consumers,\u201d said Mr. Gilles.\n\nThe app typically showcases six to 12 videos each day from media companies like CNN, Vice and the New York Times, and even shows like HBO\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight with John Oliver.\u201d For example, Tuesday\u2019s edition features a video from the Atlantic titled \u201cBeating Disease With Big Data.\u201d\n\nHyper\u2019s slick interface features a handful of video players which automatically play short highlight clips\u2014not unlike GIFs. Users can swipe through a few pages listing that day\u2019s videos and tap to play the ones that interest them. Hyper will also automatically download these videos to a person\u2019s device, so they can be watched even without a Web connection.\n\nThe plan is for Mic.com to promote Hyper to its audience and help build a new daily habit for millennial consumers. Mic.com drew 19.1 million unique visitors in January, up 55% from last year, according to comScore.\n\nBy trying to build out a stand-alone content platform, Mic is taking on a big mission, one that many publishers have shied away from. That\u2019s a challenge Mic\u2019s co-founder and Chief Executive Chris Altchek openly acknowledged, and is embracing head on.\n\n\u201cWe want to build a new way to consume video on your phone,\u201d he said. \u201cThis offers a 10 times better experience than is available today. Every generation has their media brands and we want to be one of them.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that the Web video universe is getting more crowded. But few companies have successfully tackled the problem of video discovery.\n\nIn 2013, entrepreneur Sofia Fenichell launched a startup Web video company called Rockpack, which offered a similar concept and boasted of content partners such as Warner Bros. But Ms. Fenichell eventually shuttered Rockpack, as the economics of marketing the app to consumers while trying to pull in revenue through digital advertising proved challenging.\n\nIn the mobile app world, it\u2019s a \u201cwar of attention,\u201d she said. \u201cHow many things are going to be on your front screen?\u201d\n\nIn this case, Hyper should benefit from Mic\u2019s built-in reach, as well as its ability to sell Hyper ads to major marketers as part of larger packages. Currently, Hyper doesn't carry any ads, but Mic is considering running traditional video ads prior to partners\u2019 content\u2014it would split revenue with the content companies it aggregates\u2014as well as some sort of native ad product.\n\nHyper may eventually offer more customized editions and even a paid subscription product, Mr. Altchek said.\n\nRob Norman, GroupM\u2019s chief digital officer, recently met with the Mic team about Hyper and said he likes the concept and the ad possibilities.\n\n\u201cThis feels like it has real benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cThe challenge of course is distribution. For us, you have to think about, \u2018what does advertising look like for an ad-rejecting generation?\u2019 I think it could be a great new creative challenge, and really raise the bar for brands.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Mic Acquires Mobile Video App Hyper"}

Facebook says it is looking at the feedback. Photo: dado ruvic/Reuters\n\nFacebook is experimenting with new advertising approaches for its Instant Articles platform after publishers encountered challenges generating ad revenue because of restrictions imposed by the social network.\n\nInstant Articles, which Facebook rolled out to all iPhone users last month, allows media companies to publish content directly to Facebook feeds instead of posting links to draw users back to their own websites. Twenty publishers are currently enrolled in the program.\n\nThe product is still in its infancy, but publishers including The Washington Post, New York Times and LittleThings.com are finding it difficult to extract as much revenue per article from Instant Articles as they do from pages on their own websites, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nThat\u2019s because of the strict guidelines Facebook has laid down on the type and volume of ads publishers are allowed to sell. For example, the guidelines state that just one \u201clarge banner\u201d ad sized 320 x 250 pixels may be included for every 500 words of content. On their own mobile properties, publishers such as The Washington Post would typically include three or perhaps four of those ads alongside a 500-word article.\n\nFacebook is also restricting the type of ads publishers may place in Instant Articles. It will not allow so-called \u201crich media\u201d ads, the animated or interactive ads that now commonly appear across publishers\u2019 sites.\n\n\u201cYou have to analyze many factors to determine the monetization potential. You have fewer impressions per pageview than we presently do, so you have to balance that, and you don\u2019t have all the animation we can sell on our own site,\u201d said Jed Hartman, chief revenue officer at the Washington Post.\n\nPublishers also are not permitted to sell Facebook-only campaigns, but instead must package Instant Articles with other inventory across their websites or other properties. As a result, publishers can\u2019t sell ads in Instant Articles at a premium.\n\nMichael Reckhow, Facebook\u2019s Instant Articles product manager, said the company received feedback from publishers and is now testing out changes to its Instant Articles ads policies, such as allowing more ads per article and ad formats that were barred previously.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s early days with Instant Articles, but one of our principles from the beginning has been to work collaboratively with our publishing partners to understand their needs and shape the product,\u201d Mr. Reckhow said. \u201cWe\u2019re currently working closely with publishers to understand how their advertising in Instant Articles compares to the mobile web so we can deliver results, while maintaining a great reading experience for people. We\u2019ve made numerous improvements to the advertising capabilities over the past few months and will continue to iterate based on publisher feedback to improve the product.\u201d\n\nPublishers are entitled to 100% of revenue generated from ads in Instant Articles, provided they sell and serve the ads themselves. If they\u2019d rather have Facebook sell ads on their behalf, publishers get a 70% cut. The advertising format and volume restrictions apply regardless of who sells the ads.\n\nFacebook has become a juggernaut in mobile advertising, with mobile accounting for 78% of the $4.3 billion in ad revenue it generated in the third quarter. The company has billed Instant Articles as a way to improve the news-reading experience on mobile devices, since Instant Articles load faster than a typical webpage. It\u2019s looking for other ways to partner with news publishers, and on Wednesday launched an app called Notify which allows smartphone users to opt-in to receive push notifications from various media outlets and online services.\n\nDespite the Facebook restrictions and the growing pains in generating ad revenue, many publishers are still confident Instant Articles will benefit them in the long-run because of its potentially huge scale. If Facebook pumps that content into users\u2019 feeds at a higher rate than links to publishers\u2019 sites, Instant Articles audiences could become so large that the limitations on ad sales won\u2019t matter, the optimists say.\n\nSites that rely heavily on Facebook for a large percentage of their traffic have a strong incentive to participate in Instant Articles. If they don\u2019t, and it becomes the primary mode of distribution on the social network, they could lose out.\n\n\u201cThe hope is that Instant Articles gives publishers way more traffic to make up for the lower monetization potential,\u201d said Joe Speiser, co-founder of LittleThings.com, which publishes \u201cfeel-good\u201d stories and videos largely optimized for social sharing.\n\nLittleThings.com sees around 80% of its traffic from Facebook and has recently begun publishing Instant Articles. \u201cIt all comes down to how Facebook prioritizes this in news feed. We\u2019ve seen them prioritize video, and if they do anything similar with Instant Articles the numbers could go through the roof.\u201d\n\nMr. Hartman of the Washington Post pointed out that Instant Articles are less susceptible to ad-blockers, which have been making life difficult for online publishers, and offer an improvedexperience for users.\n\n\u201cThe assumption is if you\u2019re giving someone a slicker, faster, more convenient way of engaging with content then you\u2019ll have strong consumer demand and increased socialization, and that will lead to a bigger audience,\u201d Mr. Hartman said.\n\nFor now, publishers are experimenting with different advertising options in the hope they can find a sustainable model. Some executives say they\u2019re beginning to allow Facebook to sell some of their Instant Articles inventory, in part because Facebook has extremely powerful data with which it can target and track ads.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s new, so we\u2019re learning how it all works and optimizing,\u201d Mr. Hartman said.\n\nWrite to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Facebook Mulls Ad Changes for Instant Articles After Publisher Pushback"}

According to the complaint, Mr. Martinez allegedly referred to personnel at an airport as \u201cblack monkeys\u201d and \u201capes\u201d and told a reporter, during a meeting Ms. Johnson attended, that he disliked living in New York\u2019s suburban Westchester County because there were \u201ctoo many Jews.\u201d\n\nMr. Martinez has denied the allegations. \u201cI want to assure our clients and my colleagues that there is absolutely no truth to these outlandish allegations and I am confident that this will be proven in court,\u201d Mr. Martinez said in a statement provided by WPP last week.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Ms. Johnson complained repeatedly to JWT and WPP executives in writing and verbally about Mr. Martinez\u2019s behavior but nothing had been done to fix the situation. WPP sent a memo to its top executives last week that said, \u201cWPP\u2019s lawyers have been conducting an enquiry into previous correspondence on these matters since February 25 and have found nothing, as yet, to substantiate these charges.\u201d\n\nIn an amended complaint filed Monday, Ms. Johnson\u2019s lawyers criticized WPP\u2019s response and said, \u201cOnly a sham investigation would permit defendants to ignore such evidence and to intimidate potential witnesses by contending that there was \u2018nothing to substantiate\u2019 Johnson\u2019s charges.\u201d\n\nThe amended complaint also sought to enter into evidence the photocopy of a disc that contains video footage from a meeting in Miami in May 2015 in which Mr. Martinez allegedly made offensive remarks.\n\nWrite to Nathalie Tadena at nathalie.tadena@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "WPP Hires Outside Law Firm to Investigate Allegations Against JWT CEO"}

Four weeks later, the rogue tweeter is now in the company\u2019s employ.\n\nConner McMahon, a 17-year-old student from the U.K., said he started his unofficial @BemeHelp support account because he thought the company\u2019s official account appeared \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the amount of tweets directed at it each day. A fan of the Beme service and its Internet-celebrity founder, Casey Neistat, Mr. McMahon said he wanted to try to lend a helping hand.\n\n\u201cI love to help people out, even if it\u2019s just with the simplest things,\u201d Mr. McMahon said in an email exchange with CMO Today. \u201cFor example, helping someone out on Twitter with support issues some user(s) maybe having. If I know the answer, why not help out! It takes some weight off the shoulders of the team at Beme.\u201d\n\nAfter contacting Mr. McMahon to ask him to remove his account over concerns it might cause confusion, the staff at Beme began wondering if the company could use his help in a more official capacity. The company is now paying the teen to help out with customer support issues on Twitter for two hours each weekday in between his studies.\n\nThe video sharing service launched in July, and deals with support requests and questions from its official @BemeApp Twitter handle. Mr. McMahon has now shuttered his unofficial account.\n\n\u201cFunnily enough, the same day Casey and I were talking about how it\u2019d be great if we could hire Conner to help with support, he emailed us wondering the same thing,\u201d said David Weiner, head of marketing and media, in an email exchange. \u201cWe quickly got it all sorted and now he\u2019s working remotely for us part-time in the U.K. Currently his role entails responding to Beme users who reach out to us on Twitter for support, but that role may evolve over time.\u201d\n\nMr. McMahon said he\u2019s currently studying creative media arts on a full-time basis at a U.K.-based college, and is considering going to university to pursue a career as a graphic designer. He would one day like to work full-time for a company like Beme, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Wiener said he has been \u201creally impressed\u201d with Mr. McMahon\u2019s work for Beme, and said he\u2019s shown real dedication to his role.\n\nIn fact, he recently discovered another unofficial Twitter account doing basic technical support, called @BemeHQ.\n\nImitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so they say.\n\nWrite to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Beme Hires Teen Behind Unsanctioned Customer Service Twitter Account"}

And even more are frustrated with the controversy that has erupted over the simple red coffee cups.\n\nA Facebook video posted by a Christian evangelist criticizing the lack of explicit holiday messaging on Starbucks\u2019 seasonal cups recently went viral. Since then, digital content engagement around Starbucks has more than doubled in the past five days, according to data from marketing technology company Amobee Brand Intelligence. And it hasn\u2019t all been good.\n\nAccording to Amobee Brand Intelligence\u2019s data, there have been 40,455 tweets between Nov. 5 and noon eastern time on Nov. 9 around \u201cRed Cup,\u201d the sarcastic hashtag #MerryChristmasStarbucks or \u201cStarbucks Red Cup.\u201d Amobee analyzes the content that users are interacting with across more than 600,000 sites on mobile, video, Web and social platforms.\n\nStarbucks has featured holiday-themed coffee cups in stores since 1997. In years past, Starbucks\u2019 festive cups have come adorn with designs of snowflakes, ornaments, reindeer and other symbols often associated with Christmas. This year, however, Starbucks is opting for a more subtle look without any holiday images. When the company unveiled the red holiday cups in late October, the company described the design as \u201ca two-toned ombre design, with a bright poppy color on top that shades into a darker cranberry below.\u201d\n\nA Starbucks holiday cup in 2004 Photo: Michael Caronna / Bloomberg News\n\nEvangelist Joshua Feuerstein posted a video on his Facebook page on Nov. 5 saying that Starbucks \u201cwanted to take Christ and Christmas off of their brand new cups. That\u2019s why they\u2019re just plain red.\u201d Mr. Feuerstein said he \u201ctricked\u201d Starbucks into acknowledging Christmas by telling the Starbucks barista his name was \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d so the barista would write it on the cup, and he encouraged other customers to do the same. The video post has garnered more than 12.8 million views, more than 157,000 likes on Facebook and been shared more than 457,000 times.\n\nWith its holiday design this year, Starbucks said it took a cue from customers who have doodled on its cups and is encouraging customers to \u201ccreate their own stories\u201d on the cups\u2019 blank canvases.\n\n\u201cIn the past, we have told stories with our holiday cups designs,\u201d Starbucks vice president of design and content, Jeffrey Fields, said in a statement put out by the company on Sunday. \u201cThis year we wanted to usher in the holidays with a purity of design that welcomes all of our stories.\u201d\n\nIn the statement, the company said it will continue to welcome customers \u201cfrom all backgrounds and religions\u201d into its stores.\n\nAccording to Amobee\u2019s data, 67% of the Tweets around Starbucks\u2019 holiday cups have carried negative sentiment. However, only 17% of the negative sentiment tweets indicated frustration towards Starbucks. Most of the negative tweets expressed outrage over the backlash surrounding the cups, per Amobee\u2019s data. There were several comments such as \u201cI can\u2019t roll my eyes any harder at this red cup Starbucks controversy,\u201d according to Amobee.\n\nAmong the tweets related to Starbucks\u2019 red cups over the last five days, 15 percent were positive and 19% were neutral.\n\nMajor controversies aren\u2019t new to the giant coffee chain. Earlier this year, the company was criticized for its initiative to stimulate the discussion of race, in which baristas were asked to write the words \u201cRace Together\u201d or place similar stickers on cups given to customers.\n\nWrite to Nathalie Tadena at nathalie.tadena@wsj.com", "date": null, "title": "Consumers Aren\u2019t So Cheery About Starbucks\u2019 Holiday Cup Controversy"}

Gang members, drug dealers and criminals who robbed American citizens of jobs, income, even their loved ones.\n\nAngel and Jacqueline Rayos-Garcia say their mother was not one of those people. She was simply a devoted mother, doing what she had to do to give them a better life than the one she had in Mexico. Still, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos was caught up in a wave of mass deportations that Angel and Jacqueline blame squarely on the President.\n\nThe teens watched in disbelief as audience members in front of them applauded Trump's hardline stance, including his commitment to building a wall.\n\nDidn't they see a difference between the \"bad ones\" and people like their mother, they wondered.\n\n\"It was sad how people agreed with him,\" Jacqueline told CNN after the speech. \"They're not in our position.\"\n\nJacqueline Rayos-Garcia speaking at the US Capitol Tuesday.\n\nAlone in a hotel lobby\n\nTuesday was Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos' 35th birthday. She spent it some 2,300 miles away from her children in her hometown of Ac\u00e1mbaro, in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato.\n\nBecause she has no television in her home she watched the speech in an empty hotel lobby, alone.\n\nShe struggled to make sense of Trump's plan. She had hoped for an explanation of why families were being separated and if there was any hope for someone like her who just wanted to be reunited with her family.\n\nGuadalupe Garcia de Rayos watches the speech in an empty hotel lobby.\n\nMore than anything, she was just hoping to catch a glimpse of her children on the screen that never came.\n\nShe teared up as former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear mentioned her children by name, saying they represented the consequences of a harsh immigration policy.\n\nShe was unable to answer questions about her case or elaborate on her reaction to the speech. She was simply sad and worried about the possibility of a future without her children.\n\nDid Trump's policies spur deportation?\n\nGarcia de Rayos' case has drawn widespread attention. Protesters in Phoenix attempted to stop her deportation in February by trying to block an Immigration and Customs Enforcement van.\n\nHer lawyer argues her deportation was a direct result of Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, which prioritizes the deportation of undocumented immigrants who are convicted or charged with crimes\n\nGarcia de Rayos came illegally to the United States in the mid-1990s with her parents when she was 14. She was arrested in 2008 during a workplace raid and convicted one year later of felony criminal impersonation.\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials have said there was nothing special about Garcia de Rayos' case. She committed a crime, was placed under a deportation order and her time had come, they said.\n\nShe became the subject of a removal order in 2013 and was placed under court-ordered supervision. For years, she reported regularly to a local ICE office -- until this month, when officials took her into custody and deported her.\n\n\"I am very proud of them, because I know they are fighting so that one day we can reunite,\" she told CNN earlier Tuesday.\n\n\"Tearing families apart\"\n\nRep. Raul Grijalva and Rep. Ruben Gallego, both Democrats from Arizona, invited the teens to be their guests.\n\nThe teens, who were both born in the United States, took their first-ever flight to be here.\n\nGallego commended the teens for stepping out into the public eye. He hopes it makes President Trump understand that his policies destroy families instead of keeping them safe.\n\n\"This could be anybody else's kids,\" he told CNN. \"Now you have two teenage kids, great teenage kids, that have no mother at home.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Spicer: At some point, laws are laws Replay More Videos ...

And I think it was well-received by the American people,\" McCain told CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash, who was moderating the discussion.\n\n\"We need more of that guy -- less of the tweeting guy,\" Graham said.\n\nBut the two also warned Trump against asserting that the raid in Yemen in which Navy SEAL William \"Ryan\" Owens was killed was successful -- despite a moving two-minute standing ovation for Owens' widow in which Trump declared his sacrifice \"etched into eternity.\"\n\n\"Remember when we were told it's just a few dead-enders in Iraq? Remember when we were told, you know, ISIL's the JV team?\" Graham said, pointing to foreign policy missteps by former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. \"Don't go down that road.\"\n\n\"Missions succeed and fail,\" McCain said. \"But those who serve and sacrifice, that doesn't affect their courage and what they've done for our nation by putting themselves in harm's way.\"\n\nThe two said they are pleased that Trump plans to roll out a new version of his executive order banning travel from several majority Muslim countries -- this time excluding Iraq.\n\nMcCain said he was worried about \"our interpreters, my friends, who literally put their lives on the line\" in Iraq.\n\nGraham said the initial travel ban was offensive to the 3,500 Muslims who serve in the US military.\n\n\"Here's what I hope the President understands: When you do something like this, if it's perceived as declaring war on the faith, we're all going to lose,\" Graham said.\n\nOn Russia\n\nGraham said if the FBI determines Trump's campaign illegally coordinated with Russia, Attorney General Jeff Sessions \"cannot make this decision\" about whether to pursue prosecutions.\n\nBut he deflected a question about a new Washington Post report that Sessions twice spoke with the Russian ambassador to the United States during the 2016 presidential campaign, saying he needs to know more.\n\n\"If there were contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, they may be legitimate; they may be OK. I want to know what happened between the Trump campaign, the Clinton campaign and the Russians,\" Graham said.\n\nBoth McCain and Graham lambasted Trump over his approach to Russia and the country's President, Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"When it comes to Russia, he has a blind spot. The bottom line is that Putin is disrupting democracy everywhere,\" Graham said.\n\nMcCain, who has called for a select committee to investigate Russia's attempts to influence the US election, said the country's efforts require more attention.\n\n\"Have no doubt, what the Russians tried to do to our election could have destroyed democracy,\" he said. \"And that's why we've got to pay a hell of a lot more attention to the Russians and the things they're doing in Europe -- and right now, they're trying to determine the outcome of the French election, and they're using cyber.\"\n\nOn Trump's plans for Congress\n\nWhile many of their Republican colleagues in Congress have worked to make inroads with the new administration, hoping to capitalize on GOP control over two branches of government, Graham and McCain have repeatedly broken with the White House.\n\nThe two criticized Trump over his calls to cut the budget for foreign aid through the State Department, saying that doing so would undercut the nation's efforts in the Middle East.\n\n\"You're never going to win this war through military force alone. The budget the President's proposing cuts the State Department by over 30%. That is soft power,\" Graham said.\n\nHe said the United States needs a budget for projects such as \"building a small school\" in combat regions like Iraq and Syria. \"An education for a poor young girl is far more damaging than any bomb. That's got to be on the table,\" he said.\n\nThe two argued Congress can pass measures that reform the nation's immigration system, and Graham said Trump is well positioned to pressure conservatives to accept citizenship or some legal status for some immigrants.\n\n\"I think Trump has the ability to tell the right, 'You know, this is a good deal. Take it,'\" Graham said.\n\nGraham pointed to two questioners during the town hall -- one man whose son was killed by an undocumented immigrant and one young man whose mother was deported in January.\n\nTurning to the young man, Graham said, \"I can tell the difference between your mother and the person who killed his son. Don't you think most Americans can tell the difference?\"\n\nHistory with Trump\n\nMcCain and Graham are both unsuccessful former presidential candidates. McCain ran in 2000 and was the GOP nominee in 2008, while Graham was a member of the crowded Republican primary field in 2016 from which Trump emerged. The two are among the Senate's foremost national security hawks, and are typically in lockstep on foreign policy issues -- urging a larger US role in combating terror threats such as ISIS in Iraq and Syria and a tougher approach to Russia.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump feuded with both McCain, whose war-hero status he questioned, and Graham, whose personal cell phone number he read aloud while on national television.\n\nAnd both have frequently criticized Trump during his five weeks in office.\n\nIn Munich on February, McCain fretted about \"the growing inability, and even unwillingness, to separate truth from lies\" -- a clear shot at Trump, who has espoused falsehoods about crowd size, voter fraud and more.\n\nGraham, meanwhile, declared Trump's budget \"dead on arrival\" Tuesday, pointing to its cuts to the State Department and complaining that Trump didn't call for more significant increases in defense spending.\n\nA lasting friendship\n\nMcCain and Graham both ended the town hall wiping away tears.\n\nThe moment came as the two leading Republican foreign policy hawks explained their close, years-long friendship.\n\n\"I feel like I'm on Oprah now,\" Graham joked.\n\nGraham pointed to McCain's loyalty, saying the Arizona senator stuck with him through a tough GOP primary and during his presidential campaign, and has also supported fellow service members who, like McCain, were prisoners of war in Vietnam.\n\n\"He is loyal to his friends. He loves his country. And if he has to stand up to his party for his country, so be it,\" Graham said of McCain. \"He would die for his country. I love him to death.\"\n\nMcCain said the two have \"common ideals, common goals for our country.\"\n\nBut he also pointed to Graham's \"humble\" upbringing -- \"including the fact that he raised his sister after his parents died. It's quite a great American success story.\"\n\nMcCain said their friendship began when Graham, then a House member, was presenting the House's case for impeachment of President Bill Clinton to senators. He recalled a Graham quip that came during a discussion of 2 a.m. White House phone calls to Monica Lewinsky amid fears she would take her affair with Clinton public.\n\n\"Congressman Graham, on the most solemn occasion, said, 'You know, where I come from, any man calling a woman at 2 a.m. is up to no good,'\" McCain said. \"I knew right then that Lindsey Graham was a guy I wanted to spend time with.\"", "date": "2017-03-01 00:00:00", "title": "McCain, Graham give their view of Trump's presidency so far"}
{"sourceurl": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/02/politics/donald-trump-aircraft-carrier-defense-funding/index.html", "sourcename": "cnn", "response_body": "(CNN) Where better to tout a military spending hike than from the deck of the most expensive ship ever built?\n\nPresident Donald Trump will head to the Navy's newest, most sophisticated vessel Thursday as he seeks to prolong the glow from his well-received address to Congress and provide a jolt of momentum to his governing agenda.\n\nThe nuclear-powered USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier is currently berthed in Newport News shipyard, Virginia, as it readies for its final sea trials as the first of a new class of flat-top ships to take to the seas. The hulking giant will provide Trump the showman with a dramatic $13 billion metaphor for his plan to boost the Navy's 270 vessels to around 350.\n\nBut before Trump gets too high on the success of his speech Tuesday night and the projection of power he will use as his backdrop, he might do well to pay heed to the pitfalls that could await him as well. Trump faces challenges to his military ambitions, in part because he has promised to \"demolish and destroy ISIS,\" as he mentioned on Tuesday night, in connection to the plan he has solicited from his generals to combat the terror group.\n\nHe also will have to battle Pentagon bureaucracy to achieve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness he has pledged to deliver and battle Congress to get the funds needed to make the investment he desires in the military.\n\nISIS fight\n\nTrump's plan to crank up the fight against ISIS comes as the long, slower strategy followed by the Obama administration appears to be bearing fruit, with allied Iraqi government and militia forces backed by US air power make progress in their bid to recapture all of the key city of Mosul, Iraq. The ISIS footprint in Syria is also shrinking.\n\nAn intensified plan to finish off ISIS more quickly could mean greater risks to US soldiers, who could be directly sent into Syria under plans currently being considered by US generals. There could also be a prolonged stay for American forces in Iraq to ensure stability after ISIS' expected defeat. Both were scenarios the Obama administration decided to avoid.\n\nJUST WATCHED Graham: We need less of tweeting Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Graham: We need less of tweeting Trump 02:16\n\nTrump's apparent tolerance for risk was highlighted by the first major combat operation of his presidency -- the anti-terror raid in Yemen that killed US Navy SEAL William \"Ryan\" Owens. Owens' father has called the raid \"stupid\" and demanded an investigation. But Trump said in his speech that he had spoken to Defense Secretary James Mattis and received assurances that the raid yielded vital intelligence.\n\nTrump quoted Mattis as telling him: \"Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.\"\n\nThen, in the emotional high point of the address, he singled out the SEAL's widow, Carryn Owens, as the House floor erupted in a prolonged standing ovation. Carryn, with tears streaming down her face, looked to the heavens and joined in the applause.\n\nMany were moved by the episode, but several observers also warned Trump not to be overconfident about the raid's success.\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN, \"One thing I would caution the President to do is don't oversell.\"\n\nHe continued, \"When a raid is being oversold, then you maybe won't learn from what you should learn from. So my advice is celebrate this young man as a hero and not oversell, and I don't know if they're overselling but we'll eventually find out.\"\n\nSequester endures\n\nTrump won't be the only recent president to visit Newport News. His predecessor, Barack Obama, held an event in the submarine manufacturing works in 2013 to lobby against sequester spending limits that cut deep into the Defense Department budget -- curbs that Trump is now trying to remove.\n\nTrump touted his plan to hike military spending by 10%, or $54 billion, to be paid for by cuts to the State Department and other government agencies, in his speech on Tuesday night.\n\n\"To keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war -- if they must -- they have to fight and they only have to win,\" Trump told lawmakers, military brass and members of his Cabinet in the televised address.\n\nJUST WATCHED Report: Massive cuts at State Department Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Report: Massive cuts at State Department 02:20\n\n\"I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.\"\n\nIt will be easier said than done for Trump to fundamentally reshape the balance of defense and domestic spending. To begin with, 60 votes will be required in the Senate to lift the sequester spending caps on military funding, and there is no guarantee Democrats will go along.\n\nSome Republicans -- like Arizona Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee -- argue that Trump's spending hike for defense is not sufficient to make up for the deep cuts that have been made during the time of the sequester.\n\nAnd Senate GOP majority leader Mitch McConnell expressed doubts that a budget that slashes the State Department's funding -- as suggested by the White House -- could pass.\n\n\"I for one, just speaking for myself, think the diplomatic portion of the federal budget is very important, and you get results a lot cheaper frequently than you do on the defense side,\" McConnell told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nCost overruns\n\nAnd while Trump is likely to highlight the Ford aircraft carrier as an example of American military might and advanced technological skill, the ship also provides the President with a warning about the unforeseen development snafus, cost overruns and delays that can accompany defense spending.\n\nTrump has made reforming the procurement process and the high cost of defense articles something of a crusade.\n\n\"We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of fantastic -- and it is a fantastic -- new F-35 jet fighter, and we'll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government,\" Trump said on Capitol Hill on Tuesday night.\n\nThe 100,000-ton, 1,100-foot-long Gerald Ford (CVN 78), named after the president who succeeded Richard Nixon after the Watergate saga, was laid down in 2009.

While Obama's second executive order (DAPA) was untouched by the Trump administration, it has been blocked by the courts and is still tied up in legal action.\n\nThe preservation of the Obama-era policies comes after Trump has attempted to tread carefully on DACA, walking a line between Republicans who want the program cut entirely, and the political and practical impact of eliminating protections for undocumented immigrants.\n\n\"We're gonna show great heart,\" Trump said in a news conference last week. \"DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you.\"\n\nBut he also spoke of possible abuses of the DACA program.\n\n\"To me, it's one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids, in many cases, not in all cases. And some of the cases, having DACA and they're gang members and they're drug dealers, too. But you have some absolutely, incredible kids, I would say mostly. They were brought here in such a way -- it's a very -- it's a very, very tough subject.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer Tuesday explicitly said \"no\" when a reporter asked if the memos could be read as settling the matter for good.\n\n\"Everyone who is here illegally is subject to removal at any time,\" Spicer said of the DHS guidance. \"But the priority that the President's laid forth and the priority that ICE is putting forward through DHS' guidance is to make sure that the people who have committed a crime or threat to public safety are the priority of their efforts, first and foremost.\"\n\nWhile the memos leave DACA and DAPA as an exception, they also make clear that any undocumented immigrant charged with a crime is now eligible for removal and no undocumented immigrants will be exempt from deportation proceedings.\n\nImmigration advocates have long been unsatisfied with Trump's focus on removing \"bad\" people. They point to his aggressive anti-immigrant rhetoric on the campaign trail, including his very first campaign speech identifying many Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists, without evidence.\n\nThey see this guidance as more of the same -- lip service to the good guys, while still maintaining avenues for labeling anyone a \"bad\" guy.\n\n\"The President made clear that they don't yet have a plan on DACA, and the guidance issued today doesn't add anything to that,\" said Kamal Essaheb, director of policy and advocacy at National Immigration Law Center.\n\n\"But we know better than to take DHS at its word on the issue: last week, we saw a breathtaking disregard for the protections promised under DACA or for sensitive locations,\" Essaheb added. \"We cannot at this time offer a confident assessment of whether anyone -- including those with DACA -- are protected from enforcement.\"\n\nThe DACA protections set up a procedure for verifying the roughly 750,000 participants in the program, including background checks. In exchange, the recipients receive permits to work and seek education in the US, though they do not receive citizenship or legal status.\n\nThe goal of the program is to allow such young people -- many of whom have lived the majority of their lives in the US -- to contribute to their communities without living in fear of being deported if caught.\n\nBut despite DHS' assurances that their increased enforcement does not affect DACA recipients, the community remains concerned that everyone is a target.\n\n\"These memos lay out a detailed blueprint for the mass deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants in America,\" said Lynn Tramonte, deputy director of America's Voice Education Fund. \"They fulfill the wish lists of the white nationalist and anti-immigrant movements and bring to life the worst of Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric.\"\n\nSeattle case reverberates\n\nThe arrest of Daniel Ramirez Medina -- a 23-year-old man who came to US illegally as a young child -- became a flash point for immigration-rights advocates earlier this month, as he had twice been granted deferred action and employment authorization under the DACA program.\n\nRamirez's lawyers call him a \"law abiding\" young father, but federal immigration officials say he is a gang member, issued him a \"notice to appear\" at immigration removal proceedings, and have terminated his DACA protection.\n\nConflicting factual accounts aside -- immigration experts say that from a practical standpoint, once the government alleges an immigrant is gang-affiliated, it's challenging to succeed in immigration court.\n\n\"There is no standard that ICE has to put forward to allege gang affiliation -- they can just say it,\" according to Heidi Altman, director of policy at the pro-immigrant National Immigrant Justice Center. \"Evidence can be as little as a picture on social media with someone who is 'gang-affiliated.'\"\n\n\"It's very difficult for judges to look past the allegation once it's been made, and because discretion is paramount in immigration court that's often the end of the story,\" she added.\n\nStephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School, further explained because that immigration courts are considered civil, not criminal, proceedings, regular due process protections do not apply in the same way.\n\nUndocumented immigrants who wind up in removal proceedings \"are not entitled to a court-appointed attorney, the standard rules of evidence do not apply, (and) hearsay can come in,\" Yale-Loehr said.", "date": "2017-02-21 00:00:00", "title": "Trump keeps DACA but chips away at barriers to deportation"}

For once, this most unorthodox of politicians struck a conventional presidential posture as he sought to stabilize his administration after a tumultuous five weeks in office.\n\nThough his language was more lofty and unifying than normal, Trump gave little quarter on the substance of his policies on issues ranging from trade, defense, immigration and counterterrorism. The result was a populist, nationalistic prescription that he said would yield \"a new chapter of American greatness.\"\n\n\"From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears, inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past, and guided by a vision, not blinded by our doubts,\" Trump said, from the Speaker's rostrum in the House of Representatives.\n\nDuring a vitriolic campaign and a raucous start to his term, Trump has done little to reach beyond his base of deeply committed voters who revile the kind of political elites that the President was staring down as he spoke on Tuesday.\n\nBut, beset by the lowest approval ratings of any new commander-in-chief of modern times, Trump made a palpable effort to court voters who didn't support him with an offer to lay down the battles of the past. In fact, his address ticked almost all the boxes of a traditional State of the Union style appearance.\n\n'Embrace this renewal'\n\n\"I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.

The question now is whether the President was previewing a new, more sober political persona or whether he will return to his old habits.\n\nThe change in his tone was evident from the first moments of his speech when he condemned the recent spate of threats against Jewish community centers, vandalism at Jewish cemeteries and the shooting of two Indian men in Kansas.\n\nHe said the violence was a reminder that \"while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its very ugly forms.\"\n\nThe comment followed heavy criticism of Trump for not addressing such violence.\n\nThe new President entered the House chamber to thunderous applause and spoke of the \"renewal of the American spirit.\"\n\nA senior White House official said Trump wrote the speech himself with input from almost every member of his presidential team of advisers.\n\nIn the emotional high point of the speech, Trump turned to the first lady's box and acknowledged Carryn Owens, the widow of a US Navy Special operator, William \"Ryan\" Owens, who was killed in an anti-terror raid in Yemen in the first major military engagement of the new administration.\n\n\"Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero -- battling against terrorism and securing our nation,\" Trump said as the House floor erupted in a prolonged standing ovation.

MUST WATCH McConnell: American's expect Obamacare repeal 01:10\n\n\"Donald Trump did indeed become presidential tonight, and I think we'll see that reflected in a higher approval rating,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said on CNN after the speech.\n\n\"The Donald Trump I heard tonight was a lot more focused and disciplined and subdued, and it was a lot more uneventful in a good way,\" moderate House Republican Charlie Dent told CNN's Tom LoBianco. \"There were not a lot of distractions tonight, this speech was much better than the inaugural speech.\"\n\nNorth Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who is up for re-election next year in a state that Trump carried, said the President delivered a \"very good speech.\"\n\n\"It was delivered with a sense of 'this is who I am, this is what I want to accomplish' and I think the goals are great,\" she said. \"How we get there is the $10,000 question.\"\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on CNN that Trump's \"speeches and the realities are very, very far apart.\"\n\n\"Until his reality catches up with his speeches, he's got big trouble,\" Schumer said.\n\nThough his rhetoric was soaring, Trump still struck hardline notes. He overruled national security adviser H.R. McMaster, according to a senior administration official, to warn of \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" Hitting themes familiar from his campaign, Trump vowed to restore \"integrity and the rule of law to our borders.\"\n\n\"We will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border,\" Trump said, drawing Republican cheers even as he didn't mention his earlier promise that Mexico would pay for construction.\n\n\"As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign\"\n\nSending shockwaves through Washington\n\nWhile such language could please conservatives, Trump sent shockwaves through Washington earlier Tuesday by telling reporters he wants to pass an immigration reform bill that could grant legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants living in the US.\n\n\"The time is right for an immigration bill as long as there is compromise on both sides,\" Trump said at the White House. But he did not provide further clarity on that position during his address.\n\nSo far there is little sign that the new President's legislative agenda, which includes repealing and replacing Obamacare, a big tax overhaul, and a $1 trillion infrastructure program , is anywhere near coming to fruition.\n\nThat explains why he devoted a considerable portion of the address to touting his achievements so far. He argued that his election alone had convinced big firms like Ford, Sprint, SoftBank and Intel to invest billions of job-creating dollars in the US. He noted that stocks have put on $3 trillion in value since his election and claimed to have saved hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars, including on the new F-35 jet fighter.\n\nTrump said he also kept his word by cutting government regulations, clearing the way for the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines and pulling out of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal.\n\nThe President also laid down clear principles for the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, a key policy goal that is threatening to become overwhelmed by the complications of writing health policy. A new system, he said, must retain coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions, should offer plans backed by tax credits and expanded health savings accounts and should preserve Medicaid expansion in the states. Trump also vowed to bring down the high price of drugs \"immediately.\"\n\n'Obamacare is collapsing'\n\n\"Obamacare is collapsing -- and we must act decisively to protect all Americans,\" he said, \"Action is not a choice -- it is a necessity.\"\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who was instrumental in passing the law, shook her head as Trump condemned it.\n\nThe President also signaled action on another key piece of his agenda -- tax reform, promising \"massive\" relief for the middle classes and cuts in corporate tax. Yet Trump also pushed for his $1 trillion infrastructure plan and spoke of his effort to boost military spending. Given that he has also said he will protect entitlements, questions will be asked about how the administration can finance its ambitious plans.\n\nTrump's speech was closely watched around the world, given that his pronouncements on foreign policy have caused alarm and confusion. There were, however, few details on national security policy to clear up misconceptions.\n\nTrump recommitted himself to a strong \"America First\" foreign policy, but also backed NATO -- as long as its members pay their dues -- while bemoaning trillions of dollars the US has spent in foreign wars abroad.\n\n\"My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America,\" said Trump. \"But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world.\"\n\nDespite some positive reviews for Trump in the room on Tuesday, the official Democratic response by former Kentucky Gov. Steven Beshear accused the President of deserting the working people who voted for him by picking a cabinet of millionaires and billionaires.\n\n\"That's not being our champion. That's being Wall Street's champion,\" Beshear said.\n\n\"Real leaders don't spread derision and division. Real leaders strengthen, they unify, they partner, and they offer real solutions instead of ultimatums and blame,\" said Beshear, accusing Trump of waging war on refugees and immigrants and endangering US security by reaching out to Russia.", "date": "2017-02-28 00:00:00", "title": "Donald Trump delivers first speech to Congress"}

It was kind of a normal flow, in and out.\"\n\nPart of what the lawmaker learned, and hopes colleagues will see is that some of this is just Trump's management style: \"His operational style is one of sort of three simultaneous conversations, on the phone quick -- it's run and gun.\"\n\nJust one week into office, Trump signed his travel ban -- catching even his supporters in the Capitol off-guard. And the persistent drip of stories about ties between Russian officials and Trump's campaign has grown into a steady stream in the last two months, finally claiming former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn in the process.\n\nAt times, the national focus has been on actual conservative legislative priorities.\n\nHouse and Senate Republicans have been working steadily behind the scenes at the Capitol, hammering out the details of the proposals they have long sought -- repealing the Affordable Care Act, overhauling the tax code -- and Trump promised them he would sign. And conservatives have applauded his nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court.\n\nWhen asked if he was concerned about the persistent questions about Russia and other problems from the White House, House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions pointed out Thursday that most of the questions he was getting were on their priority: repealing Obamacare.\n\nThe opposition\n\nNow House and Senate Republicans will head back to their districts for the first serious break since the start of January, where most of them will be met by well-organized groups of protesters swarming their town halls.\n\nDemocrats see a ticking clock for the unified Republican government that erodes their support, the longer that they stay distracted from their agenda and dealing with Trump issues.\n\n\"It's certainly making it harder for Republicans to get their domestic agenda through Congress. Every day that they're obsessed about the developing scandal around Flynn and the context of the Russian government, it makes it less likely they're going to be able to get a repeal of the Affordable Care Act or a trickle-down tax cut through Congress,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat.\n\n\"It'd be a risky bet to believe that this administration is going to get radically more functional over the course of the next four years,\" Murphy added.\n\nSenate Democrats are doing everything they can to contribute to that dysfunction.\n\nIn lieu of actual filibusters -- Democrats ended the ability to filibuster typical appointments in 2013 -- they turned to committee walkouts and long, overnight debates, on many nominees.\n\nAlthough Democrats are outnumbered 52-48 in the Senate, they've scored some points -- like Sen. Elizabeth Warren's breaking of Senate rules to lure McConnell into a late-night fight.\n\n\"We have 30 hours post-cloture debate that happens no matter what's happening over here. In one way, we've got plenty to do, but it's certainly not helpful to have the distraction,\" said Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican and routine critic of Trump's actions.\n\nAsked if he thought Republicans would have been struggling with overnight debates and walkouts if Jeb Bush or Rubio had won, Flake said, \"No. I think it's clear we wouldn't.\"\n\nThe Gorsuch pick\n\nThe nomination that may be the most normal is actually Gorsuch.\n\nTrump's presentation of Gorsuch was so exceedingly normal, by White House standards, that it looked like a clear reset after the failure of the travel ban.\n\nYet even the daily, routine tours of Gorsuch through the Senate offices since then have underscored the almost daily stories of White House dysfunction -- and frequent confusion in Congress about what Trump wants.\n\nEven Hill Republicans' shelter from the Trump storm -- Vice President Mike Pence, a de facto member of Congress, complete with a new office below the House chambers -- took a beating this week after it was discovered Trump kept him in the dark for two weeks about Flynn's misleading of him.\n\nOne Republican lawmaker close to the Trump administration floated Pence as a bright spot for Republicans, but then cringed when reminded he had been kept out of the loop for two weeks.\n\n\"Yeah. So I would imagine there are some tough conversations happening,\" the Republican said.\n\nReconnecting with Hill allies\n\nBefore his press conference, Trump invited his closest Hill allies to the White House -- members who endorsed him early on in his campaign when the establishment was still on the fence about the wildcard nominee.\n\nAccording to sources in the meeting, there was a fair bit of reminiscing about the campaign and the connections made in those early days. No talk of voter fraud though, an issue Trump has repeatedly brought up at meetings with lawmakers as he maintains without evidence that he, not Hillary Clinton, won the popular vote.\n\n\"It was very positive,\" a source in the meeting said. \"He talked about health care and getting that going.\"\n\nWhile some on the Hill fear that Trump's White House is divided, sources in the meeting said the administration strongly pushed back against that narrative. At one point, sources in the room said the administration made light of the news coverage of the West Wing.\n\n\"They feel like the image being painted or portrayed is not correct,\" a source in the room said.\n\nFrom the meeting, sources say Trump is still very committed to ensuring he gets his border wall. One member in the meeting suggested that a double fence might work well enough, but Trump pushed back.\n\nSupporters inside the meeting say he touted a bedrock of his campaign -- the border wall -- and emphasized it would be a wall, not a fence.\n\n\"He was going to build it,\" the source said.\n\nThat's a fight yet to come.", "date": "2017-02-17 00:00:00", "title": "Republicans hang on for Donald Trump's wild ride"}

Mark Walker, the head of a group of fiscal conservatives, said after the meeting.\n\nMany conservatives, despite the lack of details, said they are confident that there will be a vote in the first quarter of the year -- a goal that House Speaker Paul Ryan has set.\n\nBut other members said their new target for moving legislation from committees to the House floor was sometime in mid-April.\n\nIn recent weeks, town halls in member's districts have erupted with angry pushback from voters who are uneasy about the Republicans' plans to transform the health care system.\n\nAt Thursday's meeting, there was a PowerPoint presentation and members were supposed to get paper versions to bring home, but they weren't ready in time for the meeting. Instead leaders promised to give each member packets with information so they will be armed with some more answers for voters.\n\nA PowerPoint distributed after the meeting included quotes from Americans who had been negatively affected by the Affordable Care Act and included maps of just how much premiums had gone up in individual states and how few options there were in some places. The slide show included a briefing of the three-part plan to give regulatory relief through administrative action, repeal and replace using reconciliation and then move forward with additional legislation.\n\nMichigan Rep. Bill Huizenga told reporters he wasn't worried they still hasn't seen a bill from leaders yet, noting that the Democrats' efforts to design Obamacare took 14 months.\n\n\"We knew we haven't gotten into this overnight,\" Huizenga said. \"We are not going to get out of it overnight.\"\n\nThe official cost estimate of the GOP proposal is still a work in progress by the Congressional Budget Office. Members are awaiting the results.\n\n\"If it comes back and it's out of the roof then it might take some more time to figure out how to pay for this,\" Walker admitted.\n\nMissouri GOP Rep. Ann Wagner downplayed the fact that leaders didn't unveil actual legislation, telling reporters \"I think we've got the outline of things that will be a part of a bill and part of a reconciliation package going along. We have had this in place for some time, and now we're getting down to some of the very specifics.\"\n\nTrump's man aims to reassure GOP\n\nNewly installed Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who recently resigned his House seat, attended the meeting and pledged \"the president is all-in on this.\"\n\nBut GOP leaders are concerned that the window for action is tight and they are scrambling to corral members around a proposal. The more time they take the more that counter-pressures from the right and left -- to speed up or slow down the process -- are making their job more difficult. They are using a budget procedure known as reconciliation to repeal major planks of the law and begin the process of replacing it. This process allows them to pass the measure with a simple majority in the Senate. But they want to use a similar strategy for tax reform so they are mindful of the need to get bill moving soon so they can tackle other issues this spring.\n\nPrice discussed the need to stick with the timeline the leaders set out. \"Let's not miss this opportunity. Let's go shoulder to shoulder, arm to arm,\" he said.\n\nBut multiple members from across the ideological spectrum stressed that a lot of decisions still hadn't been made on key issues.\n\n\"So there's obviously unanswered questions and -- no shocker here -- we have differences of opinion even within our conference,\" Huizenga told reporters.\n\nFuture of Obamacare taxes, Medicaid programs\n\nCommittee leaders walked through several policy issues they are working through such as how to design tax credits for those who will be shopping for health care in the new system and how to address how money will flow to states that administer the Medicaid program.\n\nThey went over plans for creating high-risk pools and proposals for incentives for broader use of health savings accounts. In the PowerPoint sent out after the meeting, there was a promise to \"deliver relief from the Obamacare taxes,\" \"eliminate the individual and employer mandate penalties,\" and \"repeal Obamacare spending for the Medicaid expansion and the new open-ended subsidies.\"\n\nBut in some areas, there was no clear consensus. For example, the details on how states would handle the Medicaid program are still being worked out. Republicans from Medicaid expansion states have been fighting to keep their expansion money and ensure voters back home who were covered under the program could remain on it, but Medicaid has long been a top target for fiscal conservatives looking to make cuts in the budget. There is wide consensus that states need more flexibility in handling their federal Medicaid dollars, but there still are not clear details on whether that flexibility will come through block grants or per capita allotments is still up in the air.\n\nWays and Means Committee Chairman Brady told reporters that the discussion was also ongoing as to what to do with Obamacare taxes. Conservatives have said the taxes need to be repealed immediately, but others have been arguing that Republicans will need to keep the taxes in place in the short term to fund their own Obamacare replacement.\n\nRep. Pete Sessions of Texas told reporters that he had no actual budget numbers of how each program- from tax credits to health savings accounts- would be funded, a key factor in whether or not Republicans will be able to rally around the plan.\n\n\"They did not overlay the money and that is the big question,\" Sessions said. \"You cannot pass policy, you have to pass money. It's about money.\"\n\nSo far, a leading member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus didn't sound impressed with what he heard from his leadership.\n\n\"So far it just sounds like Obamacare light,\" said Idaho Republican Rep. Raul Labrador.", "date": "2017-02-16 00:00:00", "title": "Republicans have long talk about Obamacare; no bill yet"}

While ICE said 75% of those arrested had criminal records and insisted the \"targeted\" enforcement was consistent with what the Obama administration had done, the department also said officers who encountered individuals not on the list of targets were given latitude to decide whether they should also be arrested for removal.\n\nFear in immigrant communities had already been running high based on Trump's pitched rhetoric against illegal immigration on the campaign trail, and only increased during the ICE enforcement actions.\n\nThe new guidance makes it more difficult to seek asylum in the US, allows the detention of substantially more undocumented immigrants and gives more authority to immigration officers -- all of which could add up to a huge increase in the number of undocumented immigrants held in detention facilities by the US government.\n\nA department spokeswoman, Gillian Christensen, said she could not confirm the guidance is final and would not comment on documents before they are publicly released, but she did not dispute their contents. The documents have yet to be published and could change before they're officially issued.\n\nOn Monday, No. 2 Senate Democrat Dick Durbin put out a statement decrying the new guidelines, calling them \"mass deportation\" implementation.\n\n\"I have called on my counterpart on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Chairman John Cornyn, to hold hearings on these orders -- we need an immediate public examination in Congress of these heavy-handed, anti-family policies,\" Durbin said, calling for legislation he's sponsored repealing Trump's executive orders, which has little hope of advancing.\n\nThe border security guidance expands the use of \"expedited removal\" proceedings for unauthorized immigrants, allowing them to be deported more quickly with limited court proceedings.\n\nIn doing so, the memo allows for the quick removal of immigrants who cannot prove they were in the US continuously for two years before being apprehended and determined to be unauthorized.\n\nPreviously, ICE and Customs and Border Protection had used \"expedited removal\" only for immigrants caught within 100 miles of the border within 14 days of entering the US or by those who arrived by sea but not at a port of entry.\n\nThe border security guidance also expands upon ending the so-called \"catch-and-release\" policies that allow individuals to be paroled from detention while awaiting immigration court proceedings, which can take years. The memo orders a surge in immigration judges and detention facilities to accommodate the holding of these individuals and lays out high thresholds for people to be released pending immigration proceedings.\n\nThe memo gives room to tighten the standard for meeting the initial \"credible fear\" test for immigrants to be considered for asylum in the US, a threshold that tens of thousands of asylum seekers now meet each year.\n\nPast Department of Justice guidance has given some leeway to those who perceive a risk of persecution or torture in their home countries. While the memo does not explicitly raise the standard for finding a \"significant possibility\" that an immigrant could be granted asylum, it places a high bar on whether the perceived threats are credible.\n\n\"The asylum officer shall consider the statements of the alien and determine the credibility of the alien's statements made in support of his or her claim and shall consider other facts known to the officer, as required by statute,\" the guidance states. \"The asylum officer shall make a positive credible fear finding only after the officer has considered all relevant evidence and determined, based on credible evidence, that the alien has a significant possibility of establishing eligibility for asylum, or for withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture, based on established legal authority.\"\n\nFurther, for immigrants to be released pending asylum proceedings after meeting the credible fear threshold, the memo requires that an ICE immigration officer is satisfied the person \"affirmatively establishes\" his or her identity and that he or she presents no security or flight risk and agrees to conditions imposed by ICE for public safety reasons.\n\nThe guidance also makes it more difficult for children entering the country without authorization to be treated as \"unaccompanied alien children.\" Under the law, the designation is for those under 18 years old who do not have a parent with them or available to care for them in the US.\n\nThe executive order notes that in some cases, individuals continued to receive protection as unaccompanied alien children even when they had a parent or guardian living illegally in the US, saying it led to \"abuses\" of the system. Kelly's memo calls for new guidance to end those \"abuses.\"\n\nThe executive order also instructed DHS to enforce of a little-used provision of the law to return asylum seekers to the contiguous territory from which they entered the US, namely Mexico. The measure would potentially send non-Mexican asylum seekers from Central America over the southern border while they await asylum proceedings instead of letting them wait in the US, a policy with which Mexico would likely take issue.\n\nKelly's memo orders the implementation of that policy and the creation of a video conferencing system to allow those removed individuals to appear at hearings without being brought back into the US.\n\nSignificantly, the interior safety order explicitly leaves intact President Barack Obama's executive orders on deferred action for childhood arrivals, known as DACA, which protects undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children from being removed and orders the low prioritization of undocumented immigrants who are parents of US citizens. The memo says, however, that the latter policy \"will be addressed in future guidance.\"\n\nThe memo re-articulates Trump's enforcement priorities from his executive order , which prioritizes for the removal certain serious criminals and others posting public safety threats, but it also broadens the scope beyond the Obama administration's measure to include virtually any undocumented immigrant in the US if they are even suspected of a crime.\n\nAt the same time, the memo declares: \"The Department no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement,\" which could imply that those protected by DACA could still be subject to removal proceedings.\n\nThe memos also expand what's known as the \"287(g)\" program, which allows the federal government to empower state and local law enforcement agencies to perform the functions of immigration officers. The language in the memo authorizes the CBP and ICE \"to accept state services\" on enforcement, but makes no mention of the National Guard, as an early draft reported by The Associated Press on Friday had done.\n\nThe memo gives broad leeway to immigration officers to make immediate decisions about whom to arrest and says officers should begin actions against individuals they meet in the course of their official duties.\n\n\"This includes the arrest or apprehension of an alien whom an immigration officer has probable cause to believe is in violation of the immigration laws,\" the implementation guidance reads, giving officers broad authority to arrest those they suspect of being undocumented.\n\nThe guidance also takes any money being used by DHS to advocate on behalf of undocumented immigrants to establish the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) Office, which is mandated by the executive order to report crimes committed by undocumented immigrants and to advocate for victims of those crimes.\n\nThis story was updated with additional details.", "date": "2017-02-18 00:00:00", "title": "DHS guidance on immigration executive orders tighten policies on credible fear, unaccompanied minors"}
{"sourceurl": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/28/politics/trump-immigration-bill/index.html", "sourcename": "cnn", "response_body": "(CNN) President Donald Trump wants to pass an immigration reform bill that could grant legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants living in the US.\n\n\"The time is right for an immigration bill as long as there is compromise on both sides,\" Trump told reporters Tuesday at the White House.\n\nThe President is eager to pass a compromise immigration bill in his first term that would stop short of granting a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, but would allow undocumented immigrants who aren't serious or violent criminals to live, work and pay taxes in the US without fear of deportation, a senior administration official said.\n\nTrump included the idea of a compromise in his address to a Joint Session of Congress on Tuesday night.\n\n\"I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation's security and to restore respect for our laws,\" Trump told lawmakers. \"If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.\"\n\nBut Trump also signaled he stands behind some of his most controversial pledges from the campaign cycle, including the \"extreme vetting\" behind his travel ban that was blocked by the courts, and a call to cut back on low-skilled workers entering the country with a \"merit-based\" immigration system.\n\nA path to citizenship for those in the country illegally would not be part of Trump's vision for this deal, with the possible exception of \"Dreamers\" -- those brought into the US illegally as children.\n\nNews of the President's support for a comprehensive reform of the US's immigration system fell against a backdrop of increasingly aggressive actions by immigration authorities across the US, who under Trump's administration have found new freedom to deport undocumented immigrants who have not been convicted of a serious crime -- the bar they were told to abide by under President Barack Obama's tenure.\n\nBut Trump's new apparent desire to grant legal status to many undocumented immigrants living in the US also marks a startling reversal from the positions he championed during his campaign for president. Trump focused on the need to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, and for much of his campaign, called for deporting all estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US. The closest he came to calling for a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants was in his calls to allow the \"good ones\" who had been deported to reenter the US through an expedited, legal process.\n\nDemocrats on the Hill may be open to working with the administration on a compromise, sources said -- but healthy skepticism remained about Trump's true intentions on Tuesday and lawmakers signaled they'd want to see more from the President, and less aggressive immigration enforcement actions, before they believed him.\n\nTackling immigration reform would be another massive legislative endeavor, piling on top of Trump's already ambitious goals of repealing and replacing Obamacare and passing a tax reform package.\n\nIt would perhaps be the ultimate test of Trump's deal-making credentials, which he touted daily on the campaign trail.\n\nSupporting a pathway to legalization for millions of undocumented immigrants could roil his base of supporters, many of whom flocked to Trump early on due to his controversial and hardline position on immigration.\n\nBut the official said Trump does not see the bill as something that would necessarily upset Trump's base, stressing that there would need to be \"a softening on both sides.\"\n\n\"It has to be a negotiation,\" the official said, arguing that the bill theoretically could make people on both the \"far right\" and \"far left\" happy -- and it's a negotiation the President believes he could successfully broker, the official said.\n\nThe President believes that the nation is now in a position where it can pass immigration legislation after decades of failed efforts, and he believes the country is \"exhausted.\"\n\n\"There's got to be a coming together,\" the official said.\n\nIn private, immigration activists on both sides of the spectrum believe that compromises can be made during Trump's tenure, although the inclusion of a \"pathway to citizenship\" for the millions of people living in the US illegally remains a tough sticking point.\n\n\"People would be willing to discuss it,\" one senior Democratic Hill aide who works on immigration issues said.\n\nFor Democrats, \"there is openness to discussing options that may fall short of a full path to citizenship,\" the aide added.\n\nStill, healthy skepticism remains about whether the White House is being genuine.\n\n\"It's just hard to believe this President,\" the Democratic staffer said. \"He says things in one room to one group of people and then the next day he does things that are the opposite.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump still has work to do to gain Democrats' trust.\n\n\"He's got a lot to undo,\" Schumer said. \"The immigrant community is rightfully scared of what President Trump has done. His executive order goes far beyond what anyone proposed. People are cowering. It's going to hurt us economically. ... (The administration doesn't) seem to know what they are doing. They simply come up with these proposals that sound good and then they can't implement them.\"\n\nSchumer was echoed by fellow Democrat Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, who said Trump would have some walking back to do.\n\n\"I would have to see the details of any proposal,\" Wyden said. \"Certainly if he is looking at something bipartisan, he's going to have to walk back some of the statements that he has made time after time after time, which in effect would say that there'd be a lot of focus by immigration authorities like ICE on people who have not committed any serious crimes.\"\n\nThe Congressional Hispanic Caucus, mainly made up of Democrats, released a statement in response to Trump's Tuesday remarks, essentially welcoming him to the immigration reform club.\n\n\"We've been ready,\" said Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, chairwoman of the caucus.\n\nAs always with immigration reform, the devil is in the details. In 2013, the Gang of Eight's immigration reform bill passed with wide bipartisan support in the Senate only to die in the House, where leadership did not move it forward.\n\nMany of the compromises in that bill still enjoy wide support in Washington, but the pathway to citizenship has remained toxic for the Republican base, which labeled it \"amnesty.\"\n\nTrump has taken a hardline position on immigration -- with charged rhetoric against illegal immigration throughout the campaign.\n\nIn the later stages of the campaign and after, he softened slightly, signaling empathy toward Dreamers and saying that deportations for some undocumented immigrants are not necessarily a priority.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the President has been clear about his openness to conversations about a compromise on immigration, but added the focus at the moment is \"border control\" and \"deporting criminals.\"\n\nFor both Democrats and Republicans, the sequencing matters greatly in negotiating a compromise on immigration.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers endorsed the idea of reform compromises, but said they would like to see efforts to move forward come in pieces. Colorado Republican Sen. Cory Gardner said there are areas of \"common ground,\" but that it would have to be done piecemeal.\n\n\"I think that's something I've been asking for for a very long time,\" Gardner said. \"I think we can find there is a way forward on an immigration package that Democrats and Republican can support. ... (But) the American people have expressed whether it's through the Affordable Care Act or through the Gang of Eight bill that they would rather see a series of package of bills that Congress can use to gain the trust of the American people as we implement the reform.\"\n\nFlorida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, one of the members of the 2013 Gang of Eight who suffered politically for his participation, said that he thinks legalization is better than the status quo, though he originally supported a pathway to citizenship in his bill.\n\n\"I personally have always believed that it's not a good idea to have millions of people in your country that can never become citizens but I certainly think legalization is better than what they have now,\" Rubio said. \"And if that's what we need to do to get progress, I would be able to accept that.\"\n\nBut he also said the path forward exists through smaller pieces.\n\n\"Immigration reform is something most people are in favor of,\" Rubio said. \"It's what's in that immigration reform that can quickly become controversial. So we'll see. It will take a lot of work. It's a tough issue. And I truly believe it has to be done in multiple steps, piecemeal approach.\"\n\nOther Republicans didn't want to discuss the possibility until border security was addressed.\n\n\"It's an important discussion and one we've been trying to resolve for many years now, so I welcome the opportunity to have that discussion,\" said No. 2 Senate Republican and Texan John Cornyn. \"For my own part, I believe we need to regain the public's confidence that we're actually serious about enforcing the law and securing the border, and to me those are the most important priorities.\"\n\nRepublicans have for years insisted they would be open to immigration reform -- if border security and enforcement of existing laws come first. They blamed President Barack Obama for not enforcing laws, and said they did not trust him enough to send him any bill that would be lenient toward undocumented immigrants, alleging he would ignore any enforcement provisions of such a bill.\n\nNow, with Trump as president, the winds have shifted and that argument is off the table, since Trump has made enforcing immigration laws on the books that have been unused for years a priority in his first month as President.\n\nBut Democrats are also concerned about sequencing, and while they would agree to certain enhanced enforcement and border-security measures, they are concerned that if they agree to too much compromise, Republicans will never return to working out something to give security to the undocumented immigrants living in the US peacefully who have often have families that are American citizens.\n\nThe difficulty has extended even to the narrow BRIDGE Act, proposed by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, which would give the undocumented Dreamers currently protected by Obama administration policies formal reprieve from deportations, should the policy be ended by the Trump administration.\n\nThe legislation enjoys generally wide support among lawmakers and could likely have the votes to pass Congress, but leadership has been hesitant to move the bill forward, with Republicans concerned that it would be viewed by their base as too lenient and Democrats concerned that agreeing to pass the BRIDGE Act along with another compromise would mean other undocumented immigrants would not be given any such relief in the future.", "date": "2017-02-28 00:00:00", "title": "Trump envisions bill allowing many immigrants to stay in US"}

First, it could press Mexico to do more to stop the flow of Central American and other migrants north through its territory as they seek a way into the US.\n\nSecond, they argue, it would begin to stop what they see as a persistent issue of immigrants seeking a life in the US presenting themselves at the border, claiming a right to asylum and then disappearing as they await final judgment on their case.\n\nThe provision in question is Section 7 of Trump's border security order last week. \"The Secretary shall take appropriate action, consistent with the requirements of section 1232 of title 8, United States Code, to ensure that aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came pending a formal removal proceeding.\"\n\nA US government source familiar with the draft implementation documents for the order confirms that the intent is to use US law to send asylum seekers to Mexico, or potentially Canada if that's where they arrive from, to await their formal hearing.\n\nA Trump administration official would not say how often the White House intends to use the maneuver. \"'Appropriate action' does nothing more than preserve our options with respect to many different policies and procedures,\" the official said.\n\nBut the policy could impact tens of thousands of people per year, according to government statistics.\n\nThe Trump administration has already kicked off under tense relations with Mexico -- from threatening tariffs on products manufactured there, to insisting the government will reimburse the US for a wall along its border.\n\nAdding on an attempt to force Mexico to accept tens of thousands of non-Mexican families to wait for years on a decision in the US could further damage the already tense relationship -- at a time when the US still needs Mexico's cooperation on a host of issues including border security and drug trafficking.\n\n\"I can't see the Mexicans accepting that,\" said Jeffery Davidow, a senior counselor at the Cohen Group and former career foreign service officer and ambassador to Mexico from 1998 to 2002. \"Asylum seekers should be the concern and responsibility of the country in which they're seeking asylum, and if they make it to the United States, I don't see the Mexican government taking on that responsibility.\"\n\nHow it works\n\nWhen migrants present themselves at the border with the US without valid entry documents, they are usually placed in expedited removal proceedings. But if they say they are seeking asylum, they are given what's called a \"credible fear\" interview. If after a series of questions an immigration officer determines they may have a claim to asylum, they are given a court date, often years in the future.\n\nIn fiscal year 2016, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services numbers, 92,990 decisions were made nationwide on credible fear, and in 73,081 cases, fear was established -- almost 80% of the cases.\n\nImmigration hawks argue that too many of these individuals never show up for court, instead living illegally in the US.\n\nRather than keeping these people in detention centers in the US for years, Section 7 would allow the US to send them back to the contiguous territory from which they entered.\n\n\"Mexico has not really been forced to deal with this stream of migration through their country as long as the US was accepting them, so this change in policy is going to force them to have to rethink their policy on these people,\" said Jessica Vaughan of the conservative immigration policy Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThe US government official who works on border security, who spoke on condition of anonymity to not get ahead of the administration, said the policy change would likely go over well enough on Capitol Hill, even among more moderate Republicans.\n\n\"This helps put Mexico on the hook for holding and detaining these people until their asylum claims are adjudicated, and what that means is it's a great incentive for the Mexicans to actually cooperate with us to secure our Southern border, so Mexico has skin in the game,\" the official said. \"Right now Mexico can take these people and send them north and it's not Mexico's problem. This makes it Mexico's problem.\"\n\nThe official cited Customs and Border Patrol numbers of more than 16,000 family units and more than 7,000 unaccompanied children apprehended at the southwest border in December alone, part of a steady uptick in the last quarter of 2016.\n\n'Flashpoint of provocation'\n\nIt's not clear, however, why Mexico would agree to the change in policy. Mexicans can already be sent back to Mexico, but the majority of asylum seekers at the border come from elsewhere, often fleeing violence and cartels in Central America. If Mexico were to decline to accept migrants, the situation could escalate if the US were to try to force them to.\n\nThe Mexican embassy in Washington and President's office in Mexico City did not respond to a request for comment on the policy shift.\n\nKaren Musalo, a professor at University of California Hastings law school specializing in refugee studies, says that Mexico has already been doing \"dirty work for the US\" in terms of intercepting migrants making their way north and working to shut down drug smugglers.\n\n\"This could be another flashpoint of provocation,\" Musalo said. \"Treating these people like lawbreakers, it's not the appropriate narrative, because people fleeing persecution, they're entitled to seek protection. And if they don't qualify for protection, then they're likely to be returned, but let's not start from the assumption that these people are criminals.\"", "date": "2017-02-03 00:00:00", "title": "Trump asylum policy could upend US-Mexico relations"}

MUST WATCH Party rivals spar over Trump immigration policy 02:05\n\nThe guidance explains how the administration plans to put in place the goals dictated in Trump's executive orders, including vastly increasing the resources to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, building a wall along the southern border and taking a hard-line position on undocumented immigrants.\n\nDHS officials repeatedly tried to emphasize that the policies are not an expansion of existing law.\n\n\"We're just simply trying to execute what Congress and the President has asked us to do,\" an official said. \"We're going to do so professionally (and) humanely ... but we are going to execute the laws of the United States.\"\n\nDACA impact\n\nLanguage was included explicitly saying Obama's executive orders protecting young undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children and undocumented parents of US citizens would be an exception to a mandate that \"the Department no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.\"\n\nA DHS official briefing reporters on the orders made note from the top that the policies would not be affected.\n\n\"No. 1: None of this affects DACA. No. 2, none of this affects DAPA/expanded DACA,\" the official said, adding that the latter policy is currently being blocked by the courts either way.\n\nThe guidance is still unclear in many respects. It rescinds Obama executive orders besides the deferred action for children and parents of citizens -- but notes that only \"to the extent of the conflict\" with new guidance, meaning some policies will remain in place.\n\nFor example, a fact sheet released by the department says that rules keeping churches and schools as off-limits from enforcement actions remain in operation.\n\nAsked about the confusion over which policies do and do not remain in place, an official said, \"There are a lot of internal policies and memoranda and procedures that have to be worked out individually and analyzed by the legal departments. ... That's a very deliberate project that will be conducted.\"\n\nBut the official emphasized the \"sensitive locations\" policy remains in place, and a second official said the rescinding of previous guidance largely applies for now to policy about prosecutorial discretion.\n\nThrough the memos, Kelly expands the government's immigration enforcement by instructing agencies to implement unused parts of existing law and by clarifying standards for certain protections, which add up to having sweeping implications for the processing of undocumented immigrants in the US.\n\nBroad discretion\n\nWhile DHS officials stressed that the agency will use its limited resources to target \"criminals,\" as Trump has said, they also acknowledged that people who were not targeted for deportation under Obama could be eligible in this administration -- giving broad latitude to agents in the field and regional offices to make decisions.\n\n\"The fact that you are not a priority does not exempt you from potential enforcement,\" an official said, adding that people with crimes like DUIs and status violations, or noncriminal histories but a final order of removal could be subject to deportation.\n\nThe Trump administration has set new enforcement priorities that could apply to virtually every undocumented immigrant in the US -- whereas the Obama administration had focused on serious and violent criminals -- sending fear through immigrant communities about indiscriminate arrests. Stepped-up ICE enforcement earlier this month, which netted nearly 700 arrests nationwide, only amplified fears. While similar enforcement actions were conducted under the Obama administration, anecdotes spread of nonthreatening undocumented immigrants being caught up amplified fears.\n\nThe memos reinforce giving broad leeway to immigration officers to make immediate decisions about whom to arrest and says officers should begin actions against individuals they meet in the course of their official duties.\n\nThe goal is to free immigration officers and law enforcement to make decisions, after critics of Obama's policies described them as having their hands tied.\n\nBut the administration also explicitly reserves the right to expand and prioritize targets, such as \"against removable aliens who are convicted felons or who are involved in gang activity or drug trafficking.\"\n\nChanges to use of laws\n\nThe new plan vastly grows the number of individuals who can be deported using \"expedited removal\" procedures, which affords immigrants almost no court proceedings.\n\nUnder the new policy, if someone can't prove he or she has been living in the US continuously for two years, he or she could now be eligible for expedited removal. Previously, this was limited in practice to people apprehended within 100 miles of the border and who had arrived within the past two weeks.\n\nThe memos also make a series of changes as part of ending so-called \"catch and release,\" where undocumented immigrants awaiting court proceedings are granted parole and leave to enter the country pending court dates that can be years in the future.\n\nIt places stricter limits on who can be paroled instead of detained, making detention pending court proceedings the default for thousands of immigrants. In an attempt to deal with the potential strain on limited detention resources, Kelly orders a surge in immigration judges and facilities.\n\nMore difficult for asylum seekers\n\nAlong these lines, the guidance also makes it more difficult to receive asylum protections, a key exception to \"expedited removal\" that often lets people stay in the US as they await a final ruling on their eligibility for asylum.\n\nWithout explicitly changing the standard for \"credible fear\" -- the threshold at which asylum seekers are granted permission to continue to pursue court hearings on their asylum claim -- the guidance makes clear that asylum officers can use more discretion in determining an individual's credibility, and use their own knowledge to weigh against what migrants claim about potential persecution or torture back home.\n\nAnother change: Once people reach the credible fear point, instead of waiting for their full hearings on asylum in the US, the new guidance makes use of a law that allows non-Mexican migrants to be sent to Mexico to wait, provided they arrived through Mexico. The change could send potentially tens of thousands of non-Mexican migrants back over the border, and would largely apply to Central Americans who flee violence, gangs and drug cartels to seek refuge in the US.\n\nDHS will also explore a video conference system to potentially keep these individuals in Mexico even for their court hearing, which could be conducted remotely.\n\nUnaccompanied minors\n\nIn further tightening of protections that allow more leniency to certain immigrants, the administration is also looking to limit protections for unaccompanied minors that seek to enter the US.\n\nThe executive order notes that in some cases, individuals continued to receive protection as unaccompanied alien children even when they had a parent or guardian living illegally in the US, saying it led to \"abuses\" of the system.\n\nKelly's memo calls for new guidance to end those \"abuses\" -- which could restrict the eligibility that was previously given to all minors under 18 who arrived without a parent or guardian in the US able to care for them.", "date": "2017-02-21 00:00:00", "title": "Trump admin sets stage for mass deportations"}

{"sourceurl": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/28/politics/donald-trump-reality-check-round-up/index.html", "sourcename": "cnn", "response_body": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump welcomed governors and insurance company executives to the White House on Monday to discuss Obamacare and other matters. But not all his claims held up well against scrutiny.\n\nHere's a look at some of his eyebrow-raising comments.\n\nVAT's a lot of bull\n\nDuring his presentation of his budget outline Monday at a meeting of the National Governors' Association, Trump railed against what he considers unfair trade practices with other countries.\n\n\"We're one of the only countries in the world that can -- people can sell their product into us and have no tax, no nothing,\" he said. \"And they get rich. And yet, if you want to do business with them, you'll have taxes, I've seen as high as 100%.\"\n\nHere's the reality: Trump is very likely referring to the value-added tax -- or VAT -- that 164 countries have but the US does not. Trump says this is an unfair advantage but the evidence suggests it's not.\n\nFirst, companies in countries with a VAT pay the same tax on products sold within their borders that US companies selling into those countries pay. So everyone is paying the tax and the US is not at any disadvantage at all.\n\nYes, it is true that no VAT gets paid on goods exported to the US. But that's because there is no VAT paid by American companies on goods produced for the US market. So, once again, everyone is paying -- or not paying -- the same thing. As a result, the World Trade Organization considers a VAT to be perfectly legal.\n\nUltimately, Trump is trying to argue that a VAT helps create a trade deficit and causes jobs to go to other countries. But the United States has trade surpluses in goods with some countries, such as the United Kingdom, Argentina, Brazil, Columbia, and Chile, that have a VAT.\n\nThis has been pointed out to the President many times in different fact checks. Yet he keeps repeating it. When an American company and a Mexican company sells the same type of goods in Mexico, both pay the same VAT to the Mexican government. Trump's claim that that is an unfair advantage is false.\n\nCNN's Patrick Gillespie contributed to this item.\n\nLook out for falling tiles!\n\nYou are taking your life in your hands every time you drive through one of those tunnels in New York -- at least according to Trump.\n\nIn decrying the state of the nation's infrastructure, the President Monday remarked on the number of tiles missing from the roof of tunnels in New York City.\n\n\"Our tunnels -- I mean, we have tunnels in New York ... and you see many tiles missing,\" he said. \"And you wonder -- you know, you're driving 40 miles an hour, 50 miles an hour through a tunnel, you take a look at the Lincoln Tunnel and the Queens Midtown Tunnel, and you're driving and you see all this loose material that's heavy.\"\n\nThis phenomenon caused him to wonder aloud about the danger of falling tiles. \"Every time I drive through, I say, 'Man, I wonder how many people are hurt or injured when they're driving at 40, 50 miles an hour through a tunnel and a tile falls off.\"\n\nHere's what the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey says about the tunnels it operates under the Hudson River connecting those two states: \"The tile structures in the various Lincoln and Holland Tunnel tubes are intact, regularly inspected and pose no danger to the public. In the last 12 months there have been no reported incidents involving falling tiles.\"\n\nAnd this from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the Queens Midtown Tunnel:\n\n\"Not a single person has been injured by any falling tiles because no tiles are falling -- they are being replaced by workers as part of an infrastructure project to repair the tunnel from Hurricane Sandy damage.\"\n\nNow, to be fair, this was just a question from Trump, not a definitive statement. So it's hard to call it true or false. But the answer to his musings over how many people have been hurt driving through these tunnels under the threat of tumbling tiles is none -- at either 40 or 50 miles per hour.\n\nMisquoting Mark Dayton -- again\n\nThe President is fond of quoting Minnesota's Democratic governor, Mark Dayton, on the failures of the Affordable Care Act. He did it again Monday when speaking to the governors' association.\n\n\"If you go to Minnesota, where they had a 66% increase (in insurance premiums), and the governor of Minnesota, who is with us today, said, Obamacare -- the Affordable Care Act -- is no longer affordable -- something to that effect. I think that might be it exactly.\"\n\nIt is not exactly.\n\nWhat Dayton said last year was that \"the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable to increasing numbers of people.\" Dayton did not say it was unaffordable to everyone, or even the majority of people in his state.\n\nHowever, state authorities noted that most people in Minnesota got their insurance through their job or bought policies on the Obamacare exchanges and were shielded from the premium increases because their premiums were subsidized by the federal government. So how big was the population that was finding the law unaffordable? \"The law isn't working well for the 2% of Minnesotans in the individual market who don't receive any financial assistance to pay for their coverage,\" Dayton said.\n\nWe would say that Trump is being misleading in describing Gov. Dayton's feelings. But this point has been made in the past\n\nSo in this case, by repeating a claim that has been shown to be misleading, Trump's assertion gets bumped up to be considered false.\n\nPeople are opting out!\n\nTrump argues virtually every day in virtually every forum that Obamacare is failing. He cites disparate pieces of evidence to bolster his point. Here's one he referred to Monday when he met with a group of insurance company executives.\n\n\"It's gotten so bad that nearly 20 million Americans have chosen to pay the penalty or received an exemption rather than buy insurance,\" Trump said.\n\nObamacare's individual mandate requires nearly all Americans to have health insurance. Those who are not covered by an employer's insurance plan or by Medicaid or Medicare must purchase insurance on the individual market, often on the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nThose who fail to buy insurance must pay a penalty unless they qualify for one of a number of exemptions. One can be excused from the mandate if you are experiencing financial hardships or if the cheapest plan in your area costs more than 8.13% of your household income. Among those also exempt are the very low-income, homeless, domestic violence victims and members of American Indian tribes.\n\nIn 2015 -- the last year for which complete figures are available -- approximately 6.5 million people paid the penalty for not having insurance and another 12.7 million were granted exemptions. That's a total of 19.2 million who fit Trump's description.\n\nIt should be noted that the number of people who paid the penalty dropped by about 20% in 2015 from the 8 million who paid it the year before. Still the President's assertion is close enough to be considered true.", "date": "2017-02-28 00:00:00", "title": "Fact-checking Trump's claims from White House meetings"}

The reports of the contacts were first published by The New York Times and CNN on February 14.\n\nThe direct communications between the White House and the FBI were unusual because of decade-old restrictions on such contacts. Such a request from the White House is a violation of procedures that limit communications with the FBI on pending investigations.\n\nLate Thursday night, White House press secretary Sean Spicer objected to CNN's characterization of the White House request to the FBI.\n\n\"We didn't try to knock the story down. We asked them to tell the truth,\" Spicer said. The FBI declined to comment for this story.\n\nThe discussions between the White House and the bureau began with FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus on the sidelines of a separate White House meeting the day after the stories were published, according to a US law enforcement official.\n\nThe White House initially disputed that account, saying that McCabe called Priebus early that morning and said The New York Times story vastly overstates what the FBI knows about the contacts.\n\nBut a White House official later corrected their version of events to confirm what the law enforcement official described.\n\nThe same White House official said that Priebus later reached out again to McCabe and to FBI Director James Comey asking for the FBI to at least talk to reporters on background to dispute the stories. A law enforcement official says McCabe didn't discuss aspects of the case but wouldn't say exactly what McCabe told Priebus.\n\nComey rejected the request for the FBI to comment on the stories, according to sources, because the alleged communications between Trump associates and Russians known to US intelligence are the subject of an ongoing investigation.\n\nThe White House did issue its own denial, with Priebus calling The New York Times story \"complete garbage.\"\n\n\"The New York Times put out an article with no direct sources that said that the Trump campaign had constant contacts with Russian spies, basically, you know, some treasonous type of accusations. We have now all kinds of people looking into this. I can assure you and I have been approved to say this -- that the top levels of the intelligence community have assured me that that story is not only inaccurate, but it's grossly overstated and it was wrong. And there's nothing to it,\" Preibus said on \"Fox News Sunday\" last weekend.\n\nCNN has previously reported that there was constant communication between high-level advisers to then-candidate Trump, Russian officials and other Russians known to US intelligence during the summer of 2016.\n\nSeveral members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees tell CNN that the congressional investigations are continuing into those alleged Russian contacts with the Trump campaign, despite Priebus' assertion that there is nothing to those reports.\n\nIt is uncertain what the committees will eventually find and whether any of the information will ever be declassified and publicly released. But the push to investigate further shows that Capitol Hill is digging deeper into areas that may not be comfortable for the White House.\n\nThe Trump administration's efforts to press Comey run contrary to Justice Department procedure memos issued in 2007 and 2009 that limit direct communications on pending investigations between the White House and the FBI.\n\n\"Initial communications between the [Justice] Department and the White House concerning pending or contemplated criminal investigations or cases will involve only the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General, from the side of the Department, and the Counsel to the President, the Principal Deputy Counsel to the President, the President, or the Vice President from the side of the White House,\" reads the 2009 memo.\n\nThe memos say the communication should only happen when it is important for the President's duties and where appropriate from a law enforcement perspective.\n\nA Department of Justice spokesman said Attorney General Jeff Sessions is reviewing the memos and that \"the Department is following the guidelines in its communications with the White House.\"\n\nThe effort to refute the CNN and New York Times stories came as increasing numbers of congressional members were voicing concern about Russia's efforts to influence individuals with ties to Trump.\n\nOn February 17, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence held a briefing with Comey. It's unclear what was said, but senators suggested there was new information discussed about Russia.\n\n\"Every briefing we go through we gain new information,\" said Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, a member of the committee. Lankford declined to be more specific about the briefing.\n\nSen. Angus King of Maine also declined to reveal what was discussed during the Comey briefing. In response to a question on Priebus' strong denial of the claims, King said he was \"surprised\" that Priebus would be \"that categorical.\"\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell of California, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the goal of his panel's inquiry is to follow \"leads wherever they go even if they may be uncomfortable to Republicans.\"\n\n\"The American public will want to know if the President had personal or financial ties to the Russian government,\" Swalwell said.\n\nUPDATED: This story has been updated to reflect new information and comment from the White House.", "date": "2017-02-23 00:00:00", "title": "FBI refused White House request to knock down recent Trump-Russia stories"}

The country donated roughly $6.4 billion -- or 29% of the $22.1 billion spent globally -- for emergencies alone in 2016, a spokesman for the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which oversees international emergency relief efforts, told CNN.\n\nThis money is given directly to governments or though multilateral institutions like the UN High Commission for Refugees, the children's charity UNICEF and the World Food Programme.\n\nForeign aid cut comes at dire time\n\nInternational charities and humanitarian agencies contacted by CNN say that the US policy shift could not have come at a worse time.\n\nThere are currently more refugees in the world than at any time since World War II with around 65 million people displaced, according to the UNHCR, fleeing war and terrorism from several conflicts including Syria and Iraq.\n\nThere is famine in South Sudan, caused by the civil war there. Famine also threatens northern Nigeria, Yemen and Somalia. An estimated 22 million people are in urgent need of aid in these four countries alone.\n\nGayle Smith, the last United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator under former President Barack Obama, expressed concern over the effects that cuts could have on emergency assistance from the US.\n\n\"If we were to significantly recede, it would be a matter of life and death for a lot of people,\" Smith told CNN.\n\nJan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, also expressed dismay over the proposed cuts.\n\n\"How could this be justified in today's world where over 65 million people are displaced, and we are faced with multiple humanitarian crises?\" he told CNN. \"To abandon the vulnerable for armaments would not make America greater but would make her smaller\".\n\nJohn Glaser, an Associate Director of Foreign Policy Studies at the CATO Institute, said cuts were not likely to significantly worsen the plight of people facing famine and war, because a lot of the aid comes in the form of military aid to foreign countries.\n\n\"While cutting the foreign aid budget may generate some gaps in resources for people in need, US foreign aid largely does not target the most in need,\" Glaser told CNN.\n\nTrump: It's about public safety\n\n\"With 20 trillion dollars in debt, the government must learn to tighten its belt,\" Trump said.\n\nThe budget blueprint would have to be approved by Congress and it's unlikely to be passed without changes.\n\nWhile foreign aid has long been a target for many conservatives, cuts to these programs are unlikely to get the Trump administration close to the $54 billion in proposed overall cuts.\n\n\"Yes, it is a fairly small part of the discretionary budget, but it is still consistent with what the President said,\" Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said of the foreign aid cuts . \"We are taking his words and turning them into polices and dollars.\"\n\nThe budget, one OMB official said , expects \"the rest of the world to step up in some of the programs this country has been so generous in funding\" over the years.\n\nPresident Trump signaled his intention to slash foreign aid in his June 2015 speech announcing his candidacy. He said the United States should \"stop sending foreign aid to countries that hate us\" and to spend the funds to \"invest in our infrastructure ... our tunnels, roads, bridges, and schools.\" In August, he said he would end \"our current strategy of nation-building\" abroad.\n\nGenerals weigh in too\n\nConcern about aid budget cuts is not limited to the offices of aid agencies and international charities.\n\nOn Monday, 121 retired US generals and admirals, including Ret. General David Petraeus, the former CIA director, signed a letter to Congress calling for foreign aid to be ring-fenced in the budget.\n\n\"The State Department, USAid, Millennium Challenge Corporation, Peace Corps and other development agencies are critical to preventing conflict and reducing the need to put our men and women in uniform in harm's way,\" they wrote.\n\nForeign Aid is not charity. We must make sure it is well spent, but it is less than 1% of budget & critical to our national security. \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) February 28, 2017\n\n\"Foreign Aid is not charity. We must make sure it is well spent, but it is less than 1% of budget & critical to our national security.\" said Republican Sen. Mario Rubio in a tweet.\n\nAside from emergencies like earthquakes, war, floods and famine, the US is also the biggest donor by far to global health efforts, contributing roughly $2.6 billion to basic health projects through USAID in 2015 alone.\n\nThe US was heavily involved in combating the recent Ebola crisis in West Africa. Had there not been the global response there could have been an international pandemic.\n\nAid agencies wait and see\n\nWhere exactly Trump proposes to make the cuts will be revealed over the coming weeks.\n\nThe UN and its partners estimate it needs $22.2 billion in 2017 to meet the needs of those countries around the globe most in crisis. Even in good years when aid money flows, the UN targets are rarely met.\n\nAn official from one of the larger UN agencies, which depends on voluntary donor funding and asked not to be named, told CNN the biggest concern was the uncertainty.\n\n\"We don't know what to expect and that is never a comfortable position to be in,\" the official said.", "date": "2017-02-28 00:00:00", "title": "Alarm as Trump pledges to slash foreign aid"}

He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student; former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He's a member and has been a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed; did very, very well.\n\nAnd so Alex, I've wished him the best. We just spoke. And he's going to be -- I think he'll be a tremendous secretary of labor.\n\nAnd also as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved weeks late, I have to say that, weeks, weeks late, Office of Management and Budget. And he will be I think a fantastic addition.\n\nPaul Singer just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump or as they say, \"never Trump.\" And Paul just left and he's given us his total support. And it's all about unification. We're unifying the party and hopefully we're going to be able to unify the country. It's very important to me. I've been talking about that for a long time. It's very, very important to me.\n\nSo I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally. And I appreciate that.\n\nI think I'll say a few words, and then we'll take some questions. And I had this time. We've been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible; just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we've done some really good work. We're very proud of that.\n\nAnd then right after that, you prepare yourselves, we'll do some questions, unless you have enough questions. That's always a possibility.\n\nI'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done.\n\nA new Rasmussen poll, in fact -- because the people get it -- much of the media doesn't get it. They actually get it, but they don't write it. Let's put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is -- to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, \"Oh, that's good.\" Now it means, \"That's good for jobs.\" Very different.\n\nPlants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States, and big league -- Ford, General Motors, so many of them. I'm making this presentation directly to the American people, with the media present, which is an honor to have you. This morning, because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit -- a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that's possible. Maybe it's not, and that's OK, too.\n\nTRUMP: Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. Tremendous disservice. We have to talk to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control.\n\nI ran for president to present the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking -- and really talking on this very entrenched power structure, and what we're doing is we're talking about the power structure; we're talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through too often times distort - not all the time - and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say - they're honest and fantastic.\n\nBut much of it is not a - the distortion -- and we'll talk about it, you'll be able to ask me questions about it. But we're not going to let it happen, because I'm here again, to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It's a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country; you see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The middle east is a disaster. North Korea - we'll take care of it folks; we're going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess.\n\nBeginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you've covered, to move forward towards stability, security and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many. We have had great conversations with the United Kingdom, and meetings. Israel, Mexico, Japan, China and Canada, really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand.\n\nWe've even developed a new council with Canada to promote women's business leaders and entrepreneurs. It's very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka. I have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis. He's over there now working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, now it's in large sections of the world.\n\nThey've spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer - another mess I inherited. And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, whose totally taken advantage of our previous administration, and they're the world's top sponsor of terrorism, and we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it's not properly solved now, it's one of the worst agreements I've ever seen drawn by anybody. I've ordered plan to begin building for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. Had great support from the Senate, I've had great from Congress, generally.\n\nWe've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military, and I will tell you that is my - I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment and their equipment is old. I used it; I talked about it at every stop. Depleted, it's depleted - it won't be depleted for long. And I think one of the reason I'm standing here instead of other people is that frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.\n\nWe have to have a strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war, we really are searching for peace, but its peace through strength. At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I'm keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we're having strong borders.\n\nWell, that's what I've been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They're so surprised, oh, he having strong borders, well that's what I've been talking about to the press and to everybody else. One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I'm doing probably aren't popular but they're necessary for security and for other reasons.\n\nAnd then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests which is more important to many politicians. I'm here following through on what I pledged to do. That's all I'm doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 electoral college votes. I wasn't supposed to get 222. They said there's no way to get 222, 230's impossible.\n\n270 which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before so that's the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media's trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made and they're not happy about it for whatever reason.\n\nAnd - but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I'll be in Melbourne, Florida five o'clock on Saturday and I heard - just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there. I turn on the T.V., open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine- tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my cabinet approved.\n\nAnd they're outstanding people like Senator Dan Coats who's there, one of the most respected men of the Senate. He can't get approved. How do you not approve him? He's been a colleague - highly respected. Brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it. We're waiting for approval. So we have a wonderful group of people that's working very hard, that's being very much misrepresented about and we can't let that happen.\n\nSo, if the Democrats who have - all you have to do is look at where they are right now. The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally, believe me. Let me list to you some of the things that we've done in just a short period of time. I just got here. And I got here with no cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.\n\nI'll go over just some of them and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks - in the weeks coming. We've withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans Pacific Partnership. We're going to make trade deals but we're going to have one on one deals, bilateral. We're going to have one on one deals.\n\nWe've directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and call for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit, it's many, many years. And then at the end of the process -- they spend 10s of millions of dollars on nonsense and at the end of the process, they get rejected.\n\nNow, they may be rejected with me but it's going to be a quick rejection. Not going to take years. But mostly it's going to be an acceptance. We want plants built and we want factories built and we want the jobs. We don't want the jobs going to other countries. We've imposed a hiring freeze on non-essential federal workers. We've imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.\n\nWe've issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody's ever seen regulations like we have. You go to other countries and you look at indexes (ph) they have and you say \"let me see your regulations\" and they're fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental - all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It's very important to me. But you don't need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.\n\nWe've stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation -- take a look at Chicago and others, taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible.\n\nWe've ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We're becoming a drug infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars. We are not going to let it happen any longer.\n\nWe've undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe. And are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border, met with general -- now Secretary Kelly yesterday and we're starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall and it's going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down just like it has on everything else I've negotiated for the government. And we are going to have a wall that works, not gonna have a wall like they have now which is either non-existent or a joke.\n\nWe've ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we have ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release. No matter who you are, release. We have begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day.\n\nThe court system has not made it easy for us. And are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, which there are many. We have taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. No parts are necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, and unsafe ruling. Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe, including reporters safe. And is vigorously defending this lawful order.\n\nI will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are, I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place and it already is in place in many places.\n\nIn fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is -- that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further.\n\nWe're issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country. So we'll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that, at the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people. That will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part. We have also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines. Thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn and they didn't say that.\n\nTRUMP: And I'm reading the order, I'm saying, why aren't we using American steel? And they said, that's a good idea, we put it in. To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C., I've started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.\n\nWe've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It is's disaster. I know you can say, oh, Obamacare. I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the Republican people our that representatives are representing.\n\nSo we've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare, and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back, to bring our jobs back to this country. Big league. It's already happening. But big league.\n\nI've also worked to install a cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You've seen what they've done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history.\n\nYou look at Rex Tillerson. He's out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people.\n\nAmong their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.\n\nNow look, fair trade. Not free, fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us almost. I may be able to find a couple that don't. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.\n\nJobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.\n\nFiat Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know you were here.\n\nGeneral Motors likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I'm announcing would never have come here.\n\nIntel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs.\n\nWalmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more, many more, these are a few that we're naming.\n\nOther countries have been taking advantage of us for decades -- decades, and decades, and decades, folks. And we're not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen.\n\nAnd one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution, highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats. You may not see that. But he'll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.\n\nThis last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it. There has never been a presidency that's done so much in such a short period of time. And we have not even started the big work yet. That starts early next week.\n\nSome very big things are going to be announced next week. So we are just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m. I hope to see you there.\n\nAnd with that, I just say, God bless America, and let's take some questions.\n\nMara (ph), Mara (ph), go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.\n\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\n\nTRUMP: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given.\n\nHe didn't have to do that, because what he did wasn't wrong -- what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That's the real problem.\n\nAnd, you know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a, you know, fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this -- that they know nothing about it; they weren't in Russia; they never made a phone call to Russia; they never received a phone call.\n\nIt's all fake news. It's all fake news. The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal -- I think it's very important -- the illegal, giving out classified information. It was -- and let me just tell you, it was given out like so much.\n\nI'll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very, very confidential, classified call. But I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that's -- I spoke to the president of Mexico; I had a good call. All of a sudden, it's out there for the world to see. It's supposed to be secret. It's supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case.\n\nSame thing with Australia. All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place. The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this. And I'm saying -- the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that's classified? How do they do it?\n\nYou know why? Because it's an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed.\n\nYes, go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\n\nTRUMP: Because when I looked at the information, I said, \"I don't think he did anything wrong; if anything, he did something right.\" He was coming into office. He looked at the information. He said, \"Huh, that's fine.\" That's what they're supposed to do. They're supposed to -- he didn't just call Russia. He called and spoke to both ways, I think there were 30-some-odd countries. He's doing the job.\n\nYou know, he was doing his job. The thing is, he didn't tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn't remember. So either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position. And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.\n\nBut he didn't tell the vice president of the United States the facts. And then he didn't remember. And that just wasn't acceptable to me.\n\nYes?\n\nQUESTION: (inaudible) clarification here. During your campaign, did anyone from your team (inaudible) Russian government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations (inaudible)? TRUMP: The failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was -- it's a joke. And the people mentioned in the story, I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren't even a part, really -- I mean, they were such a minor part. They -- I hadn't spoken to them.\n\nI think the one person -- I don't think I've ever spoken to him. I don't think I've ever met him. And he actually said he was a very low-level member of I think a committee for a short period of time. I don't think I ever met him. Now, it's possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don't think I ever met him. I didn't talk to him ever. And he thought it was a joke.\n\nThe other person said he never spoke to Russia; never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries. That's what he does. I mean, people know that.\n\nThat's Mr. Manafort, who's -- by the way, who's by the way a respected man. He's a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody -- people knew that. Everybody knew that.\n\nSo, these people -- and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don't print it because that's not good for their stories.\n\nTRUMP: So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.\n\nHe then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country. So that's the extent.\n\nRussia is fake news. Russia -- this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they're there, because we have our new people going in place, right now.\n\nAs you know, Mike Pompeo has -- has now taken control of the CIA, James Comey at FBI, Dan Coats is waiting to be approved, I mean he is a senator and a highly respected one and he's still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in.\n\nAnd just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Time's story, yesterday. And it talked about -- these are (ph) front page.\n\nSo director of national intelligence just put out, acting a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community, this was just given to us, is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true.\n\nSo they took this front page story out of The Wall Street Journal top and they just wrote the story that its not true. And I'll tell you something, I'll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth that I guess I have all my life but I've never seen more dishonest media than frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.\n\nBut I will say that, I never get phone calls from the media. How did they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page?\n\nThat was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story. And it was nasty and then they called, they said we never said that, we like Mr. Trump. They called up my office, we like Mr. Trump, we never said that.\n\nAnd it was totally -- they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you, totally misrepresented. I said give us the retraction. They never gave us a retraction and frankly, I then went on to other things.\n\nOK, go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) said today that you have big intellectual margins (inaudible) 300 or more (ph), or 350 (ph) electoral (ph) votes. President Obama about 365 (OFF-MIKE).\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: Obama (OFF-MIKE) 426 on (OFF-MIKE). So why should Americans...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: ...I'm skipping that information, I don't know, I was just given (ph) we had a very, very big margin.\n\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) why should Americans trust you (OFF-MIKE) the information (OFF-MIKE)?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I don't know, I was given that information. I was given -- I actually, I've seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that? OK thank you, that's...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Go ahead Sir, yes?\n\nQUESTION: Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn did -- whether there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you ask for transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly the Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who he was communicating with?\n\nWhat-- what evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing? Further to that, Sir, you said on a couple of locations this morning, you are going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks.\n\nTRUMP: We are.\n\nQUESTION: Can we ask what you're going to do and also, we've heard about a -- a review of the intelligence community headed up by Steven Feinberg, what can you tell us about that?\n\nTRUMP: Well, first of all about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo and James Comey and they're in position so I hope that we'll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.\n\nThe gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man and he's offered his services and you know, it's something we may take advantage of. But I don't think we're need that at all because of the fact that you know, I think that we are gonna be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.\n\nAs far as the general's concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn't sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn't think anything is wrong, you know, really didn't think.\n\nIt was really, what happened after that but he didn't think anything was done wrong. I didn't either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said \"well I don't see\" -- to me, he was doing the job.\n\nThe information was provided by -- who I don't know, Sally Yates. And I was a little surprised because I said \"doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there.\" But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as -- as far as the actual making the call, fact I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job.\n\nThat was very normal. You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So -- and I do. And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.\n\nQUESTION: Sir, if I could, on the leaks -- on the leaks, sir...\n\nTRUMP: ...Go ahead. Finish off then I'll get you.\n\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. What will you do on the leaks? You've said twice today...\n\nTRUMP: ...Yes, we're looking at them very -- very, very serious. I've gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies and we're -- I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They're put out by people either in agencies -- I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don't have our people in because we can't get them approved by the Senate.\n\nWe just had Jeff Sessions approved. Injustice, as an example (ph). So, we are looking into that very seriously. It's a criminal act. You know what I say, when I -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was -- honestly, I was really, really surprised.\n\nBut I said \"you know, it doesn't make sense. That won't happen\" but that wasn't that important a call, it was fine, I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world, the president who's a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said \"that's terrible that it was leaked\" but it wasn't that important. But then I said to myself \"what happens when I'm dealing with the problem of North Korea?\"\n\nWhat happens when I'm dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information, very important, very -- you know, I mean at the highest level? Are you going to be reporting about that too? So, I don't want classified information getting out to the public and in a way that was almost a test.\n\nSo I'm dealing with Mexico, I'm dealing with Argentina, we were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the \"Washington Post\" and gets put into the \"New York Times\" and I'm saying \"what's going to happen when I'm dealing on the Middle East? What's going to happen when I'm dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?\n\nWe got to stop it. That's why it's a criminal penalty.\n\nQUESTION: I just want to get you to clarify this very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?\n\nTRUMP: Well the leaks are real. You're the one that wrote about them and reported them, I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake. So one thing that I felt it was very important to do -- and I hope we can correct it. Because there's nobody I have more respect for -- well, maybe a little bit but the reporters, good reporters.\n\nIt's very important to me and especially in this position. It's very important. I don't mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true and, you know, over a course of time, I'll make mistakes and you'll write badly and I'm OK with that. But I'm not OK when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN, it's so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.\n\nI don't watch it any more because it's very good -- he's saying no. It's OK, Jim (ph). It's OK, Jim (ph), you'll have your chance. But I watch others too. You're not the only one so don't feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be -- I think it would be frankly more interesting. I know how good everybody's ratings are right now but I think that actually -- I think that'd actually be better.\n\nPeople -- I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that's right. I don't know, Peter (ph), is that one right? Because you know I think they have lower -- I heard lower than Congress. But honestly, the public would appreciate it, I'd appreciate it -- again, I don't mind bad stories when it's true but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.\n\nTRUMP: I think we're setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I'm looking, some of them had them approved immediately.\n\nI'm going forever and I still have a lot of people that we're waiting for. And that's all they're doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he's got over there and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And, you know, I think that they'd be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they're happy and everybody's good.\n\nAnd sometimes -- I mean, I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that's OK. That's fine. But I think it would -- I think they would be much better served, John, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics.\n\nAnd they say it, and everybody understands it. Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.\n\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\n\nTRUMP: Well, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there, I have no anything. Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they're not giving classified information. They're giving stuff -- what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates.\n\nWhich, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine -- seriously -- can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair. OK, he should be put in the electric -- you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, OK. Maybe not you John. Yes? We'll do you next Jim, I do you next(ph).\n\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) clarify --\n\nTRUMP: Yes, yes, sure\n\nQUESTION: Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador --\n\nTRUMP: No, I didn't.\n\nQUESTION: -- prior to your -- TRUMP: No, I didn't.\n\nQUESTION: -- inauguration.\n\nTRUMP: No, I didn't.\n\nQUESTION: And then fired him --\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me.\n\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\n\nTRUMP: No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn't doing it.\n\nI didn't direct him, but I would have directed him because that's his job. And it came out that way -- and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job and I agreed with him. And since then, I've watched many other people say that.\n\nNo, I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn't do it. OK? Jim?\n\nQUESTION: Thank you very much, and just for the record, we don't hate you. I don't hate you.\n\nTRUMP: OK.\n\nQUESTION: So, pass that along --\n\nTRUMP: Ask -- ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job. OK?\n\nQUESTION: If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far here, sir --\n\nTRUMP: Well, that's -- well, you know, we do have other people. You do have other people and your ratings aren't as good as some of the other people that are waiting.\n\nQUESTION: It's pretty good right now, actually.\n\nTRUMP: OK, go ahead, John.\n\nQUESTION: If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that. At one time --\n\nTRUMP: I was OK with it.\n\nQUESTION: -- you said -- you said that you loved WikiLeaks. At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 e-mails. I'm wondering, sir, if you -- TRUMP: Well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a pile after that.\n\nQUESTION: Then(ph), your(ph) numbers(ph) were off too.\n\nTRUMP: No -- no, but I did say 30. But it was actually higher than that.\n\nQUESTION: If -- if I may ask you, sir, it -- it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged during(ph) the campaign --\n\nTRUMP: OK, fair question. Ready?\n\nQUESTION: Well, if I may ask you that --\n\nTRUMP: No -- no, but let me do one at a time.\n\nQUESTION: If I may as a follow up?\n\nTRUMP: Do you mind?\n\nQUESTION: Yes, sir.\n\nTRUMP: All right. So, in one case, you're talking about highly classified information. In the other case, you're talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss. I will say this, if John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.\n\nHe said terrible things about her. But it wasn't classified information. But in one case, you're talking about classified -- regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong -- at my suggestion -- and I give Reince great credit for this -- at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.\n\nI don't want to be hacked. And we did that. And you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed. The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked and terrible things came in. And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so -- they were -- when I heard some of those things I picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page, it wasn't even in the papers.\n\nAgain, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been headline in every newspaper. I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions to a debate and she -- and she should have reported herself.\n\nWhy did Hillary Clinton announce that, \"I'm sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it's inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job.\" QUESTION: And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl (ph) was asking you about. You said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don't understand. It seems that there's a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?\n\nTRUMP: The reporting is fake. Look, look...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: You know what it is? Here's the thing. The public isn't -- you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don't know if it's true or false because they're not involved. I'm involved. I've been involved with this stuff all my life. But I'm involved. So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not. I just see many, many untruthful things.\n\nAnd I'll tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word \"tone.\" The tone is such hatred. I'm really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such -- I do get good ratings, you have to admit that -- the tone is such hatred.\n\nI watched this morning a couple of the networks. And I have to say, Fox & Friends in the morning, they're very honorable people. They're very -- not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That's all I can say. It's the most honest.\n\nBut the tone, Jim. If you look -- the hatred. The, I mean, sometimes -- sometimes somebody gets...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o'clock in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump. The good news is he doesn't have good ratings. But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump. And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth; the hatred coming from other people on your network.\n\nNow, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. I'm amazed by it. And I just think you'd be a lot better off, I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN. You know.\n\nI -- I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it's -- it's brutal.\n\nNow, they'll take this news conference -- I'm actually having a very good time, OK? But they'll take this news conference -- don't forget, that's the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day. OK?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: No, that's how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people. That's for sure. But I'm having a good time.\n\nTomorrow, they will say, \"Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.\" I'm not ranting and raving. I'm just telling you. You know, you're dishonest people. But -- but I'm not ranting and raving. I love this. I'm having a good time doing it.\n\nBut tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, \"Donald Trump rants and raves.\" I'm not ranting and raving.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQUESTION: If I may, just one more followup...\n\nTRUMP: Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter? Peter, should I have -- let him have a little bit more?\n\nSit down. Sit down. We'll...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nQUESTION: Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir...\n\nTRUMP: I'm changing it from fake news, though.\n\nQUESTION: Doesn't that under...\n\nTRUMP: Very fake news.\n\nQUESTION: ... I know, but aren't you...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nTRUMP: Go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Real news, Mr. President, real news.\n\nTRUMP: And you're not related to our new...\n\nQUESTION: I am not related, sir. No. I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.\n\nTRUMP: I looked -- you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta.\n\nQUESTION: I'm sure you checked that out, sir.\n\nTRUMP: OK. Now I checked it -- I said -- they said, \"No, sir.\" I said, \"Do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.\"\n\nQUESTION: But aren't you -- aren't you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press, the press in this country, when you call stories you don't like \"fake news\"? Why not just say it's a story I don't like.\n\nTRUMP: I do that.\n\nQUESTION: When you call it \"fake news,\" you're undermining confidence in our news media (inaudible) important.\n\nTRUMP: No, no. I do that. Here's the thing. OK. I understand what you're -- and you're right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I'll say, \"Wow, that's going to be a great story.\" And I'll get killed.\n\nI know what's good and bad. I'd be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you. But I know what's good. I know what's bad. And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive -- sometimes something that should be very positive, they'll make OK. They'll even make it negative.\n\nSo I understand it. So, because I'm there. I know what was said. I know who's saying it. I'm there. So it's very important to me.\n\nLook, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press. The press -- the public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don't know. But they don't believe you. If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?\n\nOf course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster. I would be your biggest fan in the world, including bad stories about me. But if you go - as an example, you're CNN, I mean it's story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing, chaos because zero chaos. We are running - this is a fine-tuned machine and Reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press (ph).\n\nYou know, I said to him yesterday this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don't talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks, but I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I'm saying \"here's my chief of staff,\" a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, he won the election, right?\n\nWe won the presidency. We got some senators, we got some - all over the country, you take a look, he's done a great job. And I said to myself, you know - and I said to somebody that was in the room, I said \"you take a look at Reince, he's working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires.\" I mean, they're fake. They're not true. And isn't that a shame because he'd rather be working on healthcare, he'd rather be working on tax reform, Jim (ph).\n\nI mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. I sort of understand there's a certain bias maybe by Jeff (ph) or somebody, you know - you know, whatever reason. But - and I understand that. But you've got to be at least a little bit fair and that's why the public sees it. They see it. They see it's not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.\n\nAnd the public is smart, they understand it. Go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: (inaudible) ...for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over the last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn't fake news? And second...\n\nTRUMP: ...I think they don't believe it. I don't think the public - that's why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don't think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I'm here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing, that's a ruse. That's a ruse. And by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.\n\nNow tomorrow, you'll say \"Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible.\" It's not terrible. It's good. We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? This thing called nuclear weapons like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things.\n\nNobody talks about that. I didn't do anything for Russia. I've done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember? With the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks. Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?\n\nHillary Clinton - that was the reset, remember it said reset? Now if I do that, oh, I'm a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that's a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who's going to be meeting with them shortly and I told him. I said \"I know politically it's probably not good for me.\" The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles off shore right out of the water.\n\nEveryone in this country's going to say \"oh, it's so great.\" That's not great. That's not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia. Now, you've had a lot of presidents that haven't taken that tack. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So, if I can - now, I love to negotiate things, I do it really well, and all that stuff. But - but it's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin.\n\nMaybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably Putin said \"you know.\" He's sitting behind his desk and he's saying \"you know, I see what's going on in the United States, I follow it closely. It's going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he's got with this fake story.\" OK?\n\nAnd that's a shame because if we could get along with Russia - and by the way, China and Japan and everyone. If we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.\n\nQUESTION: Is tax reform on the line (ph)?\n\nQUESTION: Mr. President? Mr. President? Mr. President, since you...\n\nTRUMP: Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We're doing Obamacare. We're in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It's not like, frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the healthcare sooner.\n\nSo we'll be submitting healthcare sometime in early March, mid- March. And after that, we're going to come up, and we're doing very well on tax reform.\n\nYes?\n\nQUESTION: Mr. President, you mentioned Russia. Let's talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as president of the United States.\n\nTRUMP: OK.\n\nQUESTION: You mentioned the vessel -- the spy vessel off the coast of the United States.\n\nTRUMP: Not good.\n\nQUESTION: There was a ballistic missile test that many interpret as a violation of an agreement between the two countries; and a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.\n\nTRUMP: Not good.\n\nQUESTION: I listened to you during the campaign ...\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. When did it happen? It happened when, if you were Putin right now, you would say, \"Hey, we're back to the old games with the United States; there's no way Trump can ever do a deal with us.\" Because the -- you have to understand. If I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, \"Oh, isn't that wonderful.\" But I know you well enough.\n\nThen you would say, \"Oh, he was too tough; he shouldn't have done that.\" Look, all of the...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nQUESTION: I'm just trying to find out your orientation to those...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal. So Hillary Clinton tries a re-set. It failed. They all tried. But I'm different than those people.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQUESTION: How are you interpreting those moves? And what do you intend to do about them? Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?\n\nTRUMP: I have. I have. And I'm so beautifully represented. I'm so honored that the Senate approved him. He's going to be fantastic.\n\nYes, I think that I've already...\n\nQUESTION: Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?\n\nTRUMP: No, I don't think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician, but I guess that's what I am now.\n\nBecause, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we're not going to make a deal.\n\nNow, I don't know that we're going to make a deal. I don't know. We might. We might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough -- the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what? I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.\n\nIf Russia and the United States actually got together and got along -- and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There's no up-side. We're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. I have been briefed. And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other.\n\nThey're a very powerful nuclear country and so are we. If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.\n\nQUESTION: So when you say they're not good, do you mean that they are...\n\nTRUMP: Who did I say is not good?\n\nQUESTION: No, I read off the three things that have recently happened. Each one of them you said they're not good.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: No, it's not good, but they happened.\n\nQUESTION: But do they damage the relationship? Do they undermine...\n\nTRUMP: They all happened recently.\n\nNo...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nQUESTION: ... this country's ability to work with Russia?\n\nTRUMP: They all happened recently. And I understand what they're doing because they're doing the same thing.\n\nNow, again, maybe I'm not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don't, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump? Does anybody in this room really believe that? OK?\n\nBut I tell you one thing, she tried to make a deal. She had the re-set. She gave all that valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I'm close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She's close to Russia.\n\nQUESTION: Can we...\n\nTRUMP: I gave -- you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing.\n\nQUESTION: Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?\n\nTRUMP: I'm not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don't talk about military response. I don't say I'm going into Mosul in four months. \"We are going to attack Mosul in four months.\" Then three months later, \"We are going to attack Mosul in one month.\" \"Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because I don't talk about military, and I don't talk about certain other things, you're going to be surprised to hear that. And by the way, my whole campaign, I'd say that. So I don't have to tell you. I don't want to be one of these guys that say, \"Yes, here's what we're going to do.\" I don't have to do that. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Wait a minute. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea. And I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn't know. And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.\n\nTRUMP: So when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I'm not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won't have to do anything, but I'm not going to tell you.\n\nOK.\n\nQUESTION: Could I just ask you -- thank you very much, Mr. President. The trouble...\n\nTRUMP: Where are you from?\n\nQUESTION: BBC.\n\nTRUMP: Here's another beauty.\n\nQUESTION: That's a good line. Impartial, free and fair.\n\nTRUMP: Yeah. Sure.\n\nQUESTION: Mr. President...\n\nTRUMP: Just like CNN right?\n\nQUESTION: On the travel ban -- we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government...\n\nTRUMP: Yeah, I do. I do. Let me tell you about this government...\n\nQUESTION: Were there any mistakes...\n\nTRUMP: Wait. Wait. I know who you are. Just wait.\n\nLet me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision. We had a court that's been overturned. Again, may be wrong. But I think it's 80 percent of the time, a lot.\n\nWe had a bad decision. We're going to keep going with that decision. We're going to put in a new executive order next week some time. But we had a bad decision.\n\nThat's the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban. You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice busses, and they were put out at various locations.\n\nDespite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect.\n\nNow, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing. I said this to my people. Give them a one-month period of time. But Gen. Kelly, now Sec. Kelly, said if you do that, all these people will come in and (inaudible) the bad ones.\n\nYou do agree there are bad people out there, right? That not everybody that's like you. You have some bad people out there.\n\nKelly said you can't do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it I said wow, never thought of it. I said how about one week? He said no good. You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don't have time to come in.\n\nNow nobody ever reports that. But that's why we did it quickly.\n\nNow, if I would've done it a month, everything would've been perfect. The problem is we would've wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would've come into our country.\n\nNow in the meantime, we're vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help. And we need help by getting that executive order passed.\n\nQUESTION: Just a brief follow-up. But if it's so urgent, why not introduce...\n\nTRUMP: Yes? Go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. I was just hoping that we could get a yes or no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?\n\nTRUMP: Well I told you, Gen. Flynn obviously was dealing. So that's one person. But he was dealing, as he should have been.\n\nQUESTION: During the election?\n\nTRUMP: No. Nobody that I know of. Nobody...\n\nQUESTION: So you're not aware of any contact during the course..\n\nTRUMP: Look, look, look...\n\nQUESTION: ... of the election?\n\nTRUMP: How many times do I have to answer this question?\n\nQUESTION: Can you just say yes or no? TRUMP: Russia is a ruse.\n\nI know you have to get up and ask a question. It's so important.\n\nRussia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven't made a phone call to Russia in years. Don't speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn't. I just have nobody to speak to.\n\nI spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago.\n\nWe had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time. I'm sure you probably get it because it was classified. So I'm sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk.\n\nI have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does.\n\nNow, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that -- whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that.\n\nQUESTION: But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?\n\nTRUMP: You know what? He said no. I could only tell you what he -- now he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right?\n\nHe was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But Paul Manafort, who's a good man also by the way, Paul Manfort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time.\n\nQUESTION: Mr. President...\n\nTRUMP: How much longer should we stay here, folks?\n\nQUESTION: Mr. President...\n\nTRUMP: Five more minutes. Is that OK? Five?\n\nQUESTION: Mr. President, on national...\n\nTRUMP: Wait. Let's see. Who's -- I want to find a friendly reporter.\n\nQUESTION: Mr....\n\nTRUMP: Are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait. Wait. Watch how friendly he is. Go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)...\n\nTRUMP: Go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: So first of all, my name is (Inaudible) from (Inaudible) Magazine. I (inaudible). I haven't seen anybody in my community, including yourself or any of the -- anyone on your staff of being (OFF-MIKE).\n\nBecause (OFF-MIKE). However, what we've already heard about and what we (OFF-MIKE) is (OFF-MIKE) so you're general forecast (ph) like 48 (OFF-MIKE). There are people who are everything (ph) happens through their packs (ph) is one of the (OFF-MIKE)...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP:...he said he was gonna ask a very simple, easy question. And it's not, its not, not -- not a simple question, not a fair question. OK sit down, I understand the rest of your question.\n\nSo here's the story, folks. Number one, I am the least anti- Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican -- quiet, quiet, quiet.\n\nSee, he lied about -- he was gonna get up and ask a very straight, simple question, so you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something, that I hate the charge, I find it repulsive.\n\nI hate even the question because people that know me and you heard the prime minister, you heard Ben Netanyahu (ph) yesterday, did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I've known Donald Trump for a long time and then he said, forget it.\n\nSo you should take that instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, I'm Lisa (ph) from the...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: See, it just shows you about the press, but that's the way the press is.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Lisa Dejardown (ph) from the PBS News Hour. On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you plan for next week? Even its broad outlines?\n\nTRUMP: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: Will it be focused on specific...\n\nTRUMP: It's a very fair question.\n\nQUESTION: ...countries? And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration.\n\nTRUMP: Right.\n\nQUESTION: What is your plan, do you plan to continue that program or to end it?\n\nTRUMP: We're gonna show great heart, DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it's one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids.\n\nIn many cases, not in all cases. And some of the cases, having DACA and they're gang members and they're drug dealers, too. But you have some absolutely, incredible kids, I would say mostly. They were brought here in such a way -- it's a very -- it's a very, very tough subject.\n\nWe're gonna deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is -- is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that.\n\nBut the DACA situation is a very, very -- it's a very difficult thing for me because you know, I love these kids, I love kids, I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and you know, the law is rough.\n\nI'm not talking about new laws, I'm talking the existing law, is very rough, it's very, very rough. As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the what I consider to be a very bad decision.\n\nBut we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways, more. But we're tailoring it now to the decision, we have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.\n\nAnd the new executive order, is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. OK?\n\nQUESTION: Mr. President...\n\n(CROSSTALK) QUESTION: ...reopening of the White House Visitors Office?\n\nTRUMP: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: And she does a lot of great work for the country as well (ph). Can you talk a little bit about what's first for (ph) Melania Trump does for the country and (inaudible) so opening White House Visitors Office, what does that mean...\n\nTRUMP: Now, that's what I call a nice question. That is very -- who are you with?\n\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\n\nTRUMP: Good, I'm gonna start watching, all right? Thank you very much. Melania's terrific, she was here last night, we had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife who is by the way, lovely.\n\nAnd we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election, as you know the Cuban Americans. And I think that Melania's gonna be outstanding, that's right, she just opened up the visitors center, in other words, touring of the White House.\n\nShe, like others that she's working with, feel very, very strongly about women's issue, women's difficulties. Very, very strongly, she's a very, very strong advocate. I think she's a great representative for this country.\n\nAnd a funny thing happens, because she gets -- she gets so unfairly -- Melania, the things they say. I've known her for a long time, she was a very successful person, she was a very successful model. She did really well.\n\nShe would go home at night and didn't even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you'll ever find. And the things they say -- I've known her for a long time -- the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she's been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.\n\nI'll just tell you this. I think she's going to be a fantastic first lady. She's going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they're not doing this for money.\n\nThey're not doing this for pay, they're doing this because they feel it; both of them. And Melania goes back and forth and after Barron finishes school -- because it's hard to take a child out of school with a few months left -- she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. OK, thank you, that's a very nice question.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Yes, oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that's OK.\n\nQUESTION: It doesn't(ph) have(ph) to be a bad question.\n\nTRUMP: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television. Go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Well, thank you so much. Mr. President, I need to find out from you, you said something as it relates to inner cities. That was one of your platforms during your campaign. Now you're --\n\nTRUMP: Fix the inner cities.\n\nQUESTION: -- president. Fixing the inner cities.\n\nTRUMP: Yep.\n\nQUESTION: What will be that fix and your urban agenda as well as your HBCU Executive Order that's coming out this afternoon? See, it wasn't bad, was it?\n\nTRUMP: That was very professional and very good.\n\nQUESTION: I'm very professional.\n\nTRUMP: We'll be announcing the order in a little while and I'd rather let the order speak for itself. But it could be something that I think that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we'll talk to you about that after we do the announcement. As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.\n\nI think it's probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did, you know, much higher than people thought I was going to get. And I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.\n\nAnd by the way, if I might add, including the women's vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get. So, we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities, having to do with education, having to do with crime. We're going to try and fix as quickly as possible -- you know, it takes a long time.\n\nIt's taken more a hundred years and more for some of these places to evolve and they evolved, many of them, very badly. But we're going to be working very hard on health and healthcare, very, very hard on education, and also we're going to be working in a stringent way, in a very good way, on crime.\n\nYou go to some of these inner city places and it's so sad when you look at the crime. You have people -- and I've seen this, and I've sort of witnessed it -- in fact, in two cases I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day.\n\nThey're living in hell. We can't let that happen. So, we're going to be very, very strong. That's a great question and -- and it's a -- it's a very difficult situation because it's been many, many years. It's been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix.\n\nWe have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there. Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities and their living in hell. I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know.\n\nThere's one Chicago that's incredible, luxurious and all -- and safe. There's another Chicago that's worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk, and that you talk about, every night on the newscasts. So, we're going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.\n\nI have great people lined up to help with the inner cities. OK?\n\nQUESTION: Well, when you say the inner cities, are you going -- are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your -- your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as --\n\nTRUMP: Am I going to include who?\n\nQUESTION: Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional --\n\nTRUMP: Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?\n\nQUESTION: -- Hispanic Caucus --\n\nTRUMP: Do you want to set up the meeting?\n\nQUESTION: No -- no -- no. I'm not --\n\nTRUMP: Are they friends of yours?\n\nQUESTION: I'm just a reporter.\n\nTRUMP: Well, then(ph) set up the meeting.\n\nQUESTION: I know some of them, but I'm sure they're watching right now.\n\nTRUMP: Let's go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it's great, the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it's great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings and he was all excited. And then he said, well, I can't move, it might be bad for me politically. I can't have that meeting.\n\nI was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him. And he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone, very nice guy.\n\nQUESTION: I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.\n\nTRUMP: He wanted it, but we called, called, called and can't make a meeting with him. Every day I walk and say I would like to meet with him because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that, some other lightweight. He was probably told - he was probably told \"don't meet with Trump. It's bad politics.\"\n\nAnd that's part of the problem in this country. OK, one more.\n\nQUESTION: (inaudible)\n\nTRUMP: No, no, one question. Two we can't handle. This room can't handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two.\n\nQUESTION: (inaudible) ...not about your personality or your beliefs, talking about (inaudible), some of it by supporters in your name. What do you...\n\nTRUMP: ...And some of it - can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You don't think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs you'll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they're put up by the other side and you think it's like playing it straight?\n\nNo. But you have some of those signs and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They'll do signs and they'll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won't be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. OK.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Go ahead, go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: You're the president now. What are you going to do about it?\n\nTRUMP: Who is that? Where is that?\n\nQUESTION: What are you going to do about - what are you going to do about (inaudible).\n\nTRUMP: Oh, I'm working on it. I'm working on it very - no, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years and long before that. In all fairness to President Obama, long before President Obama we have had a very divided - I didn't come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here.\n\nWe're going to work on it very hard. One of the questions I was asked, I thought it was a very good question was about the inner cities. I mean, that's part of it. But we're going to work on education, we're going to work on - you know, we're going to stop - we're going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials, we're going to try and stop crime.\n\nWe're not going to try and stop, we're going to stop crime. But it's very important to me - but this isn't Donald Trump that divided a nation. We went eight years with President Obama and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try - I will do everything within my power to fix that. I want to thank everybody very much.\n\nIt's a great honor to be with you. Thank you.

MUST WATCH Trump: We have to start winning wars again 01:21\n\nMonday's announcement is only a budget blueprint and federal agencies will begin working with the White House to determine how to comply with their new budget. The proposals from the White House will also go to the agencies with suggestions on what to cut.\n\nMulvaney said Monday that the White House intends to have a budget to Congress by March 16 and have a final budget finished by \"the first part of May.\"\n\nA Trump administration official told CNN that all $54 billion will be cut in fiscal year 2018. Multiple officials have also made clear over the last 48 hours that the EPA and foreign aid will be cut significantly under the new plan.\n\nThe budget, one OMB official said, expects \"the rest of the world to step up in some of the programs this country has been so generous in funding\" over the years.\n\nForeign aid makes up roughly 1% of the federal budget and includes a host of programs meant to help implement national security policy. While foreign aid has long been a target for conservatives, cuts to these programs are unlikely to get the Trump administration close to the $54 billion in proposed overall cuts.\n\nThe budget blueprint, which will outline in the clearest terms to date what Trump's policy priorities will be as president, fits with Trump's pledges to increase defense spending and cut government waste as a candidate.\n\n\"Yes, it is a fairly small part of the discretionary budget, but it is still consistent with what the President said,\" Mulvaney said of the foreign aid cuts. \"We are taking his words and turning them into polices and dollars.\"\n\nMulvaney said Trump's proposed 2018 budget will include funds for the US-Mexico border wall, an issue that animated the President's 2016 campaign.\n\nTrump, in addition to the 2018 increase, will also seek a $30 billion in supplemental defense money for the fiscal year 2017, a senior administration official told CNN. Mulvaney said some funding for the border wall will be included that measure.\n\nSen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, criticized the defense numbers as not robust enough. McCain was the lone member of his party to vote against Mulvaney and indicated he would do so during Mulvaney's consideration because he did not believe Mulvaney would offer the level of commitment to defense spending that he wanted.\n\n\"President Trump intends to submit a defense budget that is a mere 3% above President Obama's defense budget, which has left our military underfunded, undersized and unready to confront threats to our national security,\" McCain said in a statement on Monday.\n\n'No more wasted money'\n\nCongress is not mandated to follow Trump's budget plan and in the coming weeks, Republicans on Capitol Hill are expected to call administration officials to Congress to explain their proposal.\n\nTrump said throughout the 2016 campaign that he would focus on spending cuts and tax reform, rhetoric that helped woo Republicans who questioned his commitment to other conservative principles.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump: Health care plan will be 'very special' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Health care plan will be 'very special' 01:03\n\n\"I want the American people to know that our budget will reflect their priorities,\" Trump said in a budget meeting earlier this month. \"We'll be directing all of our departments and agencies to protect every last American and every last tax dollar. No more wasted money.\"\n\nTrump's closest advisers have also previewed dramatic changes to the federal government budget. At the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday, Steve Bannon, a top Trump aide, said that new administration's aim was \"deconstruction of the administrative state,\" a comment many federal workers saw as a pledge to weaken regulatory agencies.\n\nMonday, Trump vowed \"a budget of great rationality\" that would be unveiled in \"great detail\" during his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening.\n\nHe wasn't specific about where he planned to cut spending, saying only he aimed for a more streamlined federal government without listing any specific agency or program that might see its budget slashed.\n\n\"We're going to do more with less,\" Trump said, promising a government that's \"lean and accountable to the people.\"\n\n\"With 20 trillion dollars in debt, the government must learn to tighten its belt,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's proposed cuts have already been met with concern inside the federal government's bureaucracy. EPA employees have told CNN that many inside the agency are still in denial about the incoming cuts to their budget, despite the fact that Trump and Scott Pruitt, the newly approved EPA administrator, pledged to trim the agency.\n\n\"It is clear to me, and will be to most agency employees very soon, that Mr. Scott Pruitt has been nominated and confirmed as administrator of the US EPA in order to make significant and substantial changes to the agency,\" John O'Grady, the president of the union that represents EPA employees, said in response to the proposed cuts.\n\nState Department spokesman Mark Toner said State is \"working with the White House and OMB to review its budget priorities.\"\n\n\"The department remains committed to a US foreign policy that advances the security and prosperity of the American people,\" Toner added.", "date": "2017-02-27 00:00:00", "title": "Trump proposes $54 billion in cuts to 'most federal agencies'"}

Penned by Alice Paul, the Equal Rights Amendment was first introduced to Congress in 1923 by Rep. Daniel R. Anthony, nephew of women's suffrage leader Susan B. Anthony.\n\nAnthony's 1923 proposal didn't pass. In fact, it was very polarizing, even among women. Eleanor Roosevelt, for instance, opposed the ERA for many years. One of the major objections at the time was questioning how the ERA would impact protective labor legislation, rules that guarded against issues like unfair hours or dangerous work conditions for women.\n\n\"If you have an amendment that says men and women are completely equal under the eyes of the law, what does that do to those protections that have then been instilled specifically based on gender?\" Jennifer Krafchik, deputy director of the National Woman's Party, explained to CNN.\n\nThe ERA was introduced in the next 49 consecutive sessions of Congress until 1972, when it passed and was sent to the states for ratification.

Numerous officials told CNN the traditional inter-agency process had been side-stepped and the White House largely worked on the order in isolation.\n\nHow to deal with US green card holders shifted as the order was put in place. At first, DHS interpreted the order to not apply to legal permanent residents and issued that to airlines. The White House overruled that on Friday night, before later clarifying that judgments would be made on a case-by-case basis and legal permanent residents would be allowed in barring other concerns.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection Acting Commissioner Kevin McAleenan acknowledged Tuesday that communication broke down, after he faced repeated questions from the press about why airlines were given contradictory guidance, why individuals were detained for hours, and about reports that some individuals were given forms to sign giving up their residency status, as well as why the Department of Defense was not aware as of Monday that Special Immigrant Visa holders were allowed to enter.\n\n\"I think it's fair to acknowledge that communications, publicly and inter-agency, haven't been the best in the rollout of this process,\" McAleenan said, in the only instance in the news conference that implementation could have been better handled.\n\nKelly said on Tuesday that he had seen \"at least two\" drafts of the order, and that he was aware the order would be signed Friday as of Thursday night.\n\n\"I did know it was under development, had an opportunity to look at at least two, as I recollect, drafts as it got closer to Friday,\" Kelly said, when asked for specifics on who was involved. \"Don't exactly know other than my legal shop representatives were involved, I would imagine some, on the landing team (from the transition), I would imagine some of them, but the point is, it came to the department, it was on a close-hold basis.\"\n\nKelly said \"only the people that needed it,\" including himself and agency lawyers, were given access. \"It was a back-and-forth process, I did talk to a representative in the White House oh probably earlier in the week about where it was going,\" he said. \"Pretty busy week, I didn't get involved in correcting grammar or reformatting the thing.\"\n\nAfter his confirmation hearing, Kelly was briefed on all the immigration executive orders under consideration by the administration and then was given the text a few days before inauguration, a White House source told CNN. Briefings also included senior department heads and staffs, as well as \"beachhead\" teams from the administration in agencies.\n\nThe order was also signed off on by the Office of Legal Counsel and the Homeland Security Council and National Security Council, the source said.\n\nKelly said anyone who had been following Trump's campaign wouldn't be surprised by the travel ban order, but he remained vague on the extent of the involvement of the interagency process.\n\n\"I knew he was going to sign an order about a year and half or two years before he became President-elect,\" Kelly said. \"From Day 1, in terms of the inauguration, finishing touches, I have to put it that way, were being put on the executive order. ... People on my staff were generally involved.\"\n\nDepartment officials also gave updated numbers on the impact of the order.\n\nMcAleenan said in the first 72 hours, 1 million travelers came to the US by air, including 500,000 foreign nationals. He said 721 individuals were denied boarding, but 1,060 legal permanent residents of the US were processed for waivers to enter the US and an additional 75 waivers were given to visa holders.\n\nThat went beyond the 109 that the White House said were affected because they were in transit when the order was signed -- numbers that the department officials said only applied to the first day of the order.\n\nKelly also pushed back strongly on any characteristic of the order as targeting Muslims.\n\n\"This is not -- I repeat -- not a ban on Muslims,\" Kelly said. \"Religious liberty is one of our most treasured values\"\n\nHe noted that the seven countries in the order were the same designated by Congress and the Obama administration for special attention in the past, saying some are in \"various states of collapse.\" The goal, Kelly said, was to allow the US to better screen travelers for terror risk.\n\n\"It is easier to play defense on the 50 yard line than the one yard line,\" Kelly said. \"I will not gamble American lives.\"", "date": "2017-01-31 00:00:00", "title": "DHS chief defends rollout of Trump's executive order"}

The communications were intercepted during routine intelligence collection targeting Russian officials and other Russian nationals known to US intelligence.\n\nAmong several senior Trump advisers regularly communicating with Russian nationals were then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and then-adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nOfficials emphasized that communications between campaign staff and representatives of foreign governments are not unusual. However, these communications stood out to investigators due to the frequency and the level of the Trump advisers involved. Investigators have not reached a judgment on the intent of those conversations.\n\nAdding to US investigators' concerns were intercepted communications between Russian officials before and after the election discussing their belief that they had special access to Trump, two law enforcement officials tell CNN. These officials cautioned the Russians could have been exaggerating their access.\n\nTrump dismissed the claims that his advisers had close ties to Russia in a tweet Wednesday.\n\n\"This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nCNN has reached out to Flynn for comment. In an interview, Manafort emphatically denied that he was in contact with Russians known to US intelligence.\n\n\"That is 100% not true, at least as far as me,\" he said. \"I cannot believe that they are including me in anything like that. I have not been involved in any of these activities.\"\n\nManafort said he did not know where US officials got the idea that he was in contact with suspected Russian operatives during the campaign but said he never spoke with any Russian officials during that time.\n\n\"I don't remember talking to any Russian officials, ever. Certainly during the time we're talking about,\" he said, calling the allegations \"boggling.\"\n\n\"I have knowingly never talked to any intelligence official or anyone in Russia regarding anything of what's under investigation,\" he said. \"I have never had any connection to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin or the Russian government before, during or after the campaign.\"\n\nManafort said the FBI has not contacted him about the allegations and said he was not aware of any other Trump campaign officials or people close to Trump being in touch with Russians known to US intelligence.\n\nManafort, who has held business ties with Russian and Ukrainian individuals, also emphasized that his work for the Yanukovich government in Ukraine should not be interpreted as closeness to the Russians. He said he worked for Yanukovich during a time when Ukraine was \"moving into the European orbit.\"\n\nThe extensive contacts drew concerns of US intelligence and law enforcement officials in part because it came at a time of Russian cyberactivities targeting mostly Democratic Party political organizations\n\nPost-election intelligence briefings on Russian meddling in the US elections included details of those communications, which included people involved in Trump's businesses.\n\nThe communications were gathered as part of routine US intelligence collection and not because people close to Trump were being targeted.\n\nThe FBI and US intelligence agencies continue to try to determine what the motive for the communications were.\n\nOne concern was whether Trump associates were coordinating with Russian intelligence operatives over the release of damaging information about the Hillary Clinton campaign.\n\n\"If that were the case, then that would escalate things,\" one official briefed on the investigation said.", "date": "2017-02-14 00:00:00", "title": "Trump aides were in constant touch with senior Russian officials during campaign"}

MUST WATCH Trump: We have to start winning wars again 01:21\n\nMonday's announcement is only a budget blueprint and federal agencies will begin working with the White House to determine how to comply with their new budget. The proposals from the White House will also go to the agencies with suggestions on what to cut.\n\nMulvaney said Monday that the White House intends to have a budget to Congress by March 16 and have a final budget finished by \"the first part of May.\"\n\nA Trump administration official told CNN that all $54 billion will be cut in fiscal year 2018. Multiple officials have also made clear over the last 48 hours that the EPA and foreign aid will be cut significantly under the new plan.\n\nThe budget, one OMB official said, expects \"the rest of the world to step up in some of the programs this country has been so generous in funding\" over the years.\n\nForeign aid makes up roughly 1% of the federal budget and includes a host of programs meant to help implement national security policy. While foreign aid has long been a target for conservatives, cuts to these programs are unlikely to get the Trump administration close to the $54 billion in proposed overall cuts.\n\nThe budget blueprint, which will outline in the clearest terms to date what Trump's policy priorities will be as president, fits with Trump's pledges to increase defense spending and cut government waste as a candidate.\n\n\"Yes, it is a fairly small part of the discretionary budget, but it is still consistent with what the President said,\" Mulvaney said of the foreign aid cuts. \"We are taking his words and turning them into polices and dollars.\"\n\nMulvaney said Trump's proposed 2018 budget will include funds for the US-Mexico border wall, an issue that animated the President's 2016 campaign.\n\nTrump, in addition to the 2018 increase, will also seek a $30 billion in supplemental defense money for the fiscal year 2017, a senior administration official told CNN. Mulvaney said some funding for the border wall will be included that measure.\n\nSen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, criticized the defense numbers as not robust enough. McCain was the lone member of his party to vote against Mulvaney and indicated he would do so during Mulvaney's consideration because he did not believe Mulvaney would offer the level of commitment to defense spending that he wanted.\n\n\"President Trump intends to submit a defense budget that is a mere 3% above President Obama's defense budget, which has left our military underfunded, undersized and unready to confront threats to our national security,\" McCain said in a statement on Monday.\n\n'No more wasted money'\n\nCongress is not mandated to follow Trump's budget plan and in the coming weeks, Republicans on Capitol Hill are expected to call administration officials to Congress to explain their proposal.\n\nTrump said throughout the 2016 campaign that he would focus on spending cuts and tax reform, rhetoric that helped woo Republicans who questioned his commitment to other conservative principles.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump: Health care plan will be 'very special' Replay More Videos ...

No more wasted money.\"\n\nTrump's closest advisers have also previewed dramatic changes to the federal government budget. At the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday, Steve Bannon, a top Trump aide, said that new administration's aim was \"deconstruction of the administrative state,\" a comment many federal workers saw as a pledge to weaken regulatory agencies.\n\nMonday, Trump vowed \"a budget of great rationality\" that would be unveiled in \"great detail\" during his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening.\n\nHe wasn't specific about where he planned to cut spending, saying only he aimed for a more streamlined federal government without listing any specific agency or program that might see its budget slashed.\n\n\"We're going to do more with less,\" Trump said, promising a government that's \"lean and accountable to the people.\"\n\n\"With 20 trillion dollars in debt, the government must learn to tighten its belt,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's proposed cuts have already been met with concern inside the federal government's bureaucracy. EPA employees have told CNN that many inside the agency are still in denial about the incoming cuts to their budget, despite the fact that Trump and Scott Pruitt, the newly approved EPA administrator, pledged to trim the agency.\n\n\"It is clear to me, and will be to most agency employees very soon, that Mr. Scott Pruitt has been nominated and confirmed as administrator of the US EPA in order to make significant and substantial changes to the agency,\" John O'Grady, the president of the union that represents EPA employees, said in response to the proposed cuts.\n\nState Department spokesman Mark Toner said State is \"working with the White House and OMB to review its budget priorities.\"\n\n\"The department remains committed to a US foreign policy that advances the security and prosperity of the American people,\" Toner added.", "date": "2017-02-27 00:00:00", "title": "Trump proposes $54 billion in cuts to 'most federal agencies'"}

It's a disaster.\"\n\nFor mainstream Republicans, Trump's remarks were a welcome departure from his preoccupation with the crowd size at his inauguration last week or his rehashing of debunked claims of voter fraud.\n\nIn his first meeting with lawmakers at the White House on Monday, Trump repeated baseless claims that millions of votes were cast illegally in November's election, which he has not been able to provide any evidence for his allegation. Some in the room said they were surprised Trump maintained his insistence on the matter, hoping he'd move on now that he's in office.\n\nTrump avoided mentioning the false voter fraud Thursday, saying only he would work toward keeping \"the ballot box safe from illegal voting.\" But he was slated to sign an executive action at the White House later Thursday tasking his administration with investigating the claims of widespread illegal voting.\n\nTrump was originally scheduled to take questions from lawmakers following his half-hour remarks. But he departed shortly after his speech ended, leaving no time for queries from members of his party. Spicer said he was \"running way behind\" and needed to return to Washington.\n\nTrump will rely on Republican members of Congress to advance areas of his agenda that aren't possible by executive action, like appropriating funds for the border wall and making changes to laws governing refugees and visas.", "date": "2017-01-26 00:00:00", "title": "Trump tells Hill GOP: Meeting Mexican president 'fruitless'"}

By Monday evening, White House press secretary Sean Spicer issued a statement saying Trump was \"evaluating the situation.\" His departure was confirmed hours later.\n\nThe former general's resignation -- at the start of only the fourth week of the new administration -- is an embarrassment for Trump and a blow to a White House already embroiled in internal political dramas. It deprives Trump, who has no foreign policy experience and a barely formed national security team, of his most important White House adviser charged with keeping Americans safe from foreign threats.\n\nHis departure sent shockwaves around the world, raising questions about the administration's readiness to confront any sudden national security crisis. And since Trump frequently boasted that he would install a governing team of the highest caliber, Flynn's fall from grace is certain to raise questions about the judgment of the President himself.\n\nPotential ramifications\n\nThe potential ramifications of the Flynn saga deepened as Monday night wore on. It emerged that the Justice Department warned the White House last month that Flynn had not been truthful about the calls with the Russian envoy and could be susceptible to Russian blackmail.\n\nThat information, disclosed to CNN by sources familiar to the matter, exposed the White House itself to questions about what officials did with the Justice Department warning and whether Trump himself was told.\n\nAlso unknown is whether Trump was aware that Flynn spoke to the Russian ambassador to the US about American sanctions imposed on Moscow late in the Obama administration to punish the Kremlin's alleged intervention in the presidential election.\n\n\"What did the President know and when did he know it?\" senior CNN political analyst David Axelrod said, using a phrase made famous by the Watergate scandal.\n\nThat unanswered question will fuel bipartisan congressional concerns about the administration's relationship with Russia and conduct in the Flynn affair.\n\nBefore Flynn's resignation, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio told CNN's Manu Raju that his contacts with the Russian embassy should form part of a Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the presidential election.\n\nAdam Schiff, the ranking Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said Flynn's departure had become inevitable, but also warned that the controversy was far from over.\n\n\"Flynn's departure does not end questions over his contacts with the Russians, which have been alleged to have begun well before December 29,\" Schiff said in a statement. \"These alleged contacts and any others the Trump campaign may have had with the Kremlin are the subject of the House Intelligence Committee's ongoing investigation.\"\n\nHe went on: \"Moreover, the Trump Administration has yet to be forthcoming about who was aware of Flynn's conversations with the Ambassador and whether he was acting on the instructions of the President or any other officials, or with their knowledge.\"\n\nPersonal aspects\n\nApart from the national security and even legal ramifications of Flynn's conduct, there is also a personal aspect for Trump.\n\nThe former general was picked for the role of national security adviser despite his controversial past. He was fired from the Obama administration from his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency over claims he was a poor manager. Conservatives, however, complained that the real reason for his clash with the previous administration was over differences on Islamic terrorism.\n\nFlynn emerged as a loyal and outspoken supporter of Trump, warning graphically on the campaign trail about the dangers America faces from terrorism. Administration officials indicated Trump did not fire Flynn.\n\nIn the end, after the revelations about Flynn and the fact that the national security adviser had embarrassed the vice president, he had little choice but to step down. Had he remained in the administration, Pence's credibility would have been seriously eroded.\n\nFlynn said in his letter of resignation that he had apologized to both the Pence and the Trump and that his apology had been accepted.\n\n\"Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador,\" Flynn said in his letter of resignation.\n\nTrump must now move quickly to find a new national security adviser both to steady his reeling administration and the morale of his NSC and to send a signal of foreign policy continuity to US allies and enemies.\n\nTrump on Monday named Gen. Keith Kellogg, who is already serving as NSC Chief of Staff as the interim national security adviser. A senior administration official said Kellogg, retired Gen. David Petraeus and former Vice Admiral Bob Harward are possible replacements for Flynn. A senior official told CNN Tuesday that Harward is considered the top contender for the job.\n\nPetraeus presents an intriguing dilemma for Trump, since he is widely respected in Washington over his stewardship of the Iraq war surge, is a consummate political player, a former CIA director and would confer immediate gravitas and credibility on a rudimentary White House foreign policy shop.\n\nBut Petraeus fell from grace over the mishandling of classified information and remains on probation. Though he would not require Senate confirmation, his appointment would open Trump to claims of inconsistency given that he lambasted his Democratic foe Hillary Clinton over her private email server during the election campaign to make the case that she was careless with the nation's top secrets.\n\nFlynn's departure from the administration also adds new uncertainty about the direction of its foreign policy, particularly towards Russia.\n\nThe former general was seen as an advocate of Trump's plans to seek to ease the estrangement in relations with Moscow -- a stance that has mystified both Republican and Democratic foreign policy experts in Washington.\n\nBut the President has in recent days reversed some of his most searing rhetoric -- embracing the so-called one-China policy that governs US relations with Taiwan after earlier warning that it was on the table in trade talks with Beijing.\n\nHe also offered a red carpet welcome to Japan's Prime Minster Shinzo Abe -- and apparently did not follow up on his demand for Tokyo to pay more for US security protection.\n\nSo a reversal on his position on Russia should not be ruled out if a new national security adviser takes a different approach.\n\nPolitically, meanwhile, Trump's decision to let Flynn go will fuel new speculation about how he will handle other feuds that are rocking his administration. It may be too early to rule out other departures.", "date": "2017-02-14 00:00:00", "title": "Flynn's resignation doesn't end controversy surrounding White House"}

CNN's Reality Check Team put her statements and assertions to the test.\n\nThe team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the speech and selected key statements, rating them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it's complicated.\n\nReality Check: Clinton on Affordable College\n\nAugust 11, 2016\n\nBy Amy Gallagher, CNN\n\nIn her speech on the economy, Clinton spoke to a deep concern for many working parents - how they'll afford college for their kids.\n\n\"It's crucial that every American has access to the education and skills they need to get the jobs of the future. So we will fight to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for everyone.\"\n\nSome context here: Clinton's final plan is the direct result of the push and pull between her and Senator Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary. Sanders touted his plan for \"tuition-free college for all\" - defining this as free tuition at public universities in a student's home state. Clinton at first countered that she would make community college tuition-free. When it was clear that Clinton was losing younger voters to Sanders, she shifted her position and offered a new proposal for free tuition at public colleges, but she was clear \"I don't want to make college free for Donald Trump's kids.\"\n\nAccording to her campaign website, her proposed plan does not cover families with household incomes over $125,000 a year. That means her plan does cover about 80% of American families. What constitutes \"middle class\" is debatable, but if you accept her definition of the middle class, the math checks out, so we rate the tuition portion of her claim: TRUE.\n\nBut what about \"debt-free for everyone\"? Her tuition plan would not cover room and board, fees, books or supplies and these are often a significant portion of the cost of college. Even families that can afford tuition may still have to take out loans to cover all the other costs of college, so we rate this portion of her claim FALSE.\n\nReality Check: Clinton on North Carolina teachers and blame\n\nJune 22, 2016\n\nBy Eve Bower, CNN\n\nSpeaking in Raleigh Wednesday about both economic conditions and the quality of public education in the state of North Carolina, Clinton blamed the state's Republican governor, Pat McCrory, and Republican-majority legislature for low teacher salaries.\n\n\"For many years,\" Clinton said, \"North Carolina was a leading state when it came to education. Now, unfortunately, thanks to your governor and the legislature, the average teacher salary can barely support a family.\"\n\nClinton's claim about current teacher salaries, on average, appears true. Using numbers from the last Census, the average North Carolina household has 2.48 people. For the purpose of this analysis, we will use the Living Wage Calculator developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Department of Urban Studies and Planning, and explore how two different possible family structures would fare on a public school teacher's salary.\n\nFirst, assuming a family consists of one adult and two children, using the Living Wage Calculator , this household in North Carolina requires $54,197 in annual pre-tax income in order to cover basic expenses including things like food, housing, and medical care.\n\nIf we instead assume that a family consists of two adults -- only one of whom earns an income, and one who is responsible for child care -- this household in North Carolina requires $43,033 in annual pre-tax income to cover basic expenses.\n\nThe major difference between the two consists of the average $9,611 per year a single parent spends on child care for two children. But neither amount affords teacher-headed families a luxurious life: according to the National Education Association's latest data, in the 2015-16 school year, the average salary for classroom teachers in North Carolina was just $47,985 -- more than $6,200 less than what is required for a \"living wage\" for the first family, and just a few thousand dollars more than what is required by the second.\n\nBut Clinton's claim is misleading where it places the blame for this solely on the Republicans currently in North Carolina state government. A recent report from the National Education Association found North Carolina third among states with the largest real decline in average teacher salaries over the decade from 2004-2015, with an inflation-adjusted decrease in salary of 10.2%. McCrory may be partially responsible for this, as he was elected in 2012, but he has only had influence over teacher salaries since 2013. McCrory was preceded by almost 20 years of Democratic governors, during which time the Senate was controlled by Democrats the entire time, and Democrats controlled the state House from 1999-2010.\n\nClinton was correct that public school teachers, on average, have a difficult time making ends meet today in North Carolina. We rate that portion of her claim true. But by placing the blame for this exclusively on the state's current Republican leadership, when the trends have existed through several Democratic administrations, we must rate the second portion of her claim as FALSE.\n\nReality Check: Clinton on states disinvesting from higher education\n\nDecember 19, 2015\n\nBy Tami Luhby, CNNMoney\n\nState finances were crushed in the wake of the Great Recession, which began in late 2007. States were forced to enact steep funding cuts, since they are required to balance their budgets annually.\n\nOn Saturday, Clinton said \"states have been disinvesting in higher education.\" She's right: The ax fell heavily on higher education budgets, forcing public colleges in many states to hike tuition and fees.\n\nSome 47 states spent less per student in the 2014-15 school year than they did in 2008, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. Only Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming spent more.\n\nStates are spending 20% less per student than they did in the 2007-08 school year, on average, according to the center. In Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana, Pennsylvania and South Carolina, spending per student is down by more than 35%.\n\nAs a result, tuition at public colleges has soared. Tuition at four-year state colleges has risen by $2,000, or 29% percent, since the 2007-08 school year. In Arizona, tuition spiked more than 80%, while in California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii and Louisiana, tuition is up more than 60%.\n\nMost states have started spending more on higher education. The trend reversed in 2013, according to a report from the State Higher Education Executive Officers.\n\nSome 35 states have increased higher ed budgets for fiscal year 2016, which started in July in most states, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. Some 12 states have cut funding for colleges.\n\nSo while most states have a ways to go before they get back to pre-recession funding levels, the trend is for more spending on colleges.\n\nVerdict: TRUE, BUT MISLEADING", "date": "2016-09-25 00:00:00", "title": "Hillary Clinton on education: CNN's Reality Check vets the claims"}

The incident was a tragedy -- Root had graduated from college hours before the wreck with a 4.0 grade point average -- but Trump's description of the undocumented immigrant's background had inaccuracies. Mejia did not recently arrive in America, as Trump suggested -- he has been here since at least 2013. And Mejia did not have a criminal record in Honduras, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. These claims are false.\n\nReality Check: Trump says Clinton money for refugees could rebuild every inner city in America\n\nJune 22, 2016\n\nBy Sonam Vashi and John Newsome, CNN\n\nDuring a 40-minute speech in New York, Trump said, \"Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration. For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.\"\n\nFirst: how much do we spend on refugees, and how much more does Clinton want to spend?\n\nIn fiscal year 2015, the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), which is under the Department of Health and Human Services, had about 1.6 billion to spend on services such as medical assistance, employment services, and English language training, among others.\n\nMore than half of the ORR's budget, or about $950 million, goes to temporary custody and care of tens of thousands of unaccompanied children, who are almost all from Central America and Mexico\n\nIn fiscal year 2015, the State Department spent about $3 billion on Migration and Refugee Assistance, and it spent $50 million on Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance.\n\nOn CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" last September, Clinton was asked if the current U.S. plan to increase the number of admitted Syrian refugees to 10,000 was enough. She replied, \"I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in.\"\n\nThere's no clean or accurate way to estimate how much each refugee costs the U.S. For an overly simplistic estimate: if we look at the part of ORR's budget that is not dedicated to the custody of Central American children (about $611 million in FY2015), the total number of refugees admitted (about 70,000), and then add in the 55,000 more Syrian refugees Clinton is proposing, the cost to the U.S. government might look something closer to $1.1 billion per year (about $500 million more than what ORR spends now), plus the $3 billion per year from the State Department.\n\nThat $4.1 billion doesn't include resettlement services funded by the private sector; NGOs like the International Rescue Committee , which helps resettle refugees in the U.S., are heavily funded by private donations. It also doesn't include the positive economic impact refugees have on their communities once resettled, according to studies.\n\nMeanwhile, the amount of money required, both from public and private sources, to revitalize all of America's inner-cities is so massive it is hard to quantify.\n\nThe Initiative for a Competitive Inner City organization, a Boston-based incubator and accelerator for inner-city growth, calls such an undertaking enormous.\n\n\"We cannot put a price tag on the vast long-term public and private investment required to revitalize America's inner cities. We know that there are at least 328 inner cities in the United States with high levels of poverty and unemployment. They demand enormous public and private resources to deal with the profound challenge of economic inequality that plagues our cities,\" the group's CEO, Steve Grossman, tells CNN.\n\nGiven how massive the price tag would be to revitalize all of America's inner cities, it's clear that it would be much larger than the approximate $4.1 billion per year that the U.S. spends on refugees.\n\nVerdict: False.\n\nReality Check: Trump on 'Operation Wetback'\n\nNovember 10, 2015\n\nBy Sonam Vashi, CNN\n\nBillionaire Donald Trump claimed Dwight Eisenhower successfully deported 1.5 million immigrants after sending them deep across the border.\n\nDuring the GOP debate in Milwaukee, Trump said, \"Dwight Eisenhower ... moved a million and a half illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border. They came back. Moved them again, beyond the border. They came back. Didn't like it. Moved them way south. They never came back.\"\n\nEisenhower's policy, named \"Operation Wetback,\" was implemented in 1954 and deported undocumented immigrants deep into Mexico. Many of the undocumented had come through wartime Bracero programs, when American labor needs led to a policy that allowed Mexicans to come to the U.S. for temporary agricultural work. When the temporary contracts were not renewed, many workers became illegal.\n\nThe exact number that the operation deported is unclear. Eisenhower's attorney general, Herbert Brownell, Jr., said in 1955 that the operation had deported 1 million people, but other researchers put that number closer to 250,000. Between 1953 and 1955, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service recorded more than 800,000 apprehensions, according to Mae M. Ngai's \"Impossible Subjects: Illegal Aliens and the Making of Modern America.\" Some research shows that more Mexicans may have left the U.S. voluntarily due to fears of apprehension.\n\nHowever, Trump never mentioned the inhumane practices that occurred when the INS deported the workers back into Mexico in the 1950s. The transfer process was widely criticized as inhumane. Some deportees were transported in over packed trucks or were dropped off without resources in the desert and died from heat stroke; others drowned after transport on overloaded ships, according to Ngai's book.\n\nVerdict: True, but misleading\n\nFact check: Donald Trump says Mexico sends its criminals across the border.\n\nAugust 6, 2015\n\nTrump said that Mexico sends its criminals across the border while the U.S. does nothing.\n\n\"They send the bad ones over because the stupid leaders of the United States will take care of them and that's what's happening, whether you like it or not,\" he said.\n\nBut the Pew Center shows that the number of undocumented immigrants coming from Mexico has actually declined after the recession of 2008 and the undocumented population is stable at 11 million people.\n\nThe Pew report also notes that the deportations hit a record high in 2013, around 400,000 per year, and many were criminals.\n\nWe find Trump's claim to be False.", "date": "2016-09-25 00:00:00", "title": "Donald Trump on immigration: CNN's Reality Check vets the claims"}

Your rates are going up 25, 35, 45, 55%.\"\n\nIt's a claim Trump has made several times before in his campaign. But an October 2015 analysis of premium changes from 2015 to 2016 by the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research organization, shows some slightly different numbers\n\nCompiling data from health marketplaces in major cities of 50 states and Washington, D.C., KFF used as a benchmark rates from the second-lowest cost plan category known as \"Silver.\" The analysis used a 40-year-old non-smoker making $30,000 a year as an example.\n\nThe year-over-year changes in plan costs varied, with some cities experiencing reductions while others showed increases. The KFF reported the \"benchmark premium ranges from -10.6% in Seattle, Washington, to 38.4% in Nashville, Tennessee.\" The group went on to say \"the simple average of the rate changes was 10.1% before accounting for the premium tax credit.\"\n\nSo, looking at individual rate changes in specific cities, there were indeed increased rates as Trump claimed, with the largest increase being 38.4% in Nashville. An increase, yes, but not as high as the 45% and 55% increases Trump alleged. And, in fact, some regions saw rate decreases.\n\nVerdict: True, but misleading.\n\nReality Check: Trump on insurance companies getting rich on Obamacare\n\nFebruary 6, 2016\n\nBy Tami Luhby, CNNMoney\n\nAsked about his plan for health care, Donald Trump lashed out at insurers.\n\n\"The insurance companies are getting rich on Obamacare. The insurance companies are getting rich on health care and health services and everything having to do with health,\" he said during the eighth Republican debate.\n\nCertainly, insurers have been doing pretty well in recent years. Health care has been one of the \"healthier\" sectors of the economy, particularly as the nation ages and needs more medical services. Obamacare was expected to be a boon for insurers, bringing them millions of new customers who would obtain coverage on the individual insurance exchanges.\n\nBut whether insurers are actually getting rich on Obamacare is another matter. UnitedHealth likely wouldn't agree with Trump. The insurance titan just reported it expects to lose nearly $1 billion on the individual health exchanges for 2015 and 2016, in large part because Obamacare enrollees are proving to be sicker and costlier than expected. To limit enrollment for 2016, it increased prices, eliminated marketing and commissions and withdrawn its top-tier products. And it is weighing exiting Obamacare next year.\n\nOther large players, including Aetna and Anthem, have said recently that they are disappointed with their Obamacare exchange businesses.\n\nSome smaller insurers have also suffered. At least a dozen cooperative insurers set up and funded by Obamacare failed in 2015.\n\nIn its third year, Obamacare has yet to prove yuuugely profitable for many insurers.\n\nVerdict: False.", "date": "2016-09-25 00:00:00", "title": "Donald Trump on health care: CNN's Reality Check team vets the claims"}

At town halls spanning the country , angry constituents criticized GOP congressmen and senators for their allegiance to President Donald Trump and demanded to know how they intend to overhaul the Affordable Care Act -- and what will happen to the 20 million people insured under the law.\n\nIt's a question that Republicans can't afford to waste much more time answering.\n\nOne of the most pressing agenda items for GOP leaders: Getting the President's full backing.\n\nWhen Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell meet with Trump Monday afternoon in the Oval Office, the duo plans to urge the President to embrace the House GOP plan publicly in his joint congressional address Tuesday night.\n\n\"This is a critical moment for him to get behind this,\" a senior Republican congressional aide told CNN.\n\nThe House GOP leadership team is growing increasingly concerned by the President's unwillingness to embrace -- or many believe, fully understand -- the congressional approach to health care. House leaders believe if Trump doesn't better articulate his support for their plan, \"it is in trouble,\" another GOP Hill aide said.\n\nAnd selling the proposal will be a tough task, especially if people stand to lose coverage.\n\nAccording to a draft of the bill obtained by CNN on Friday, Republicans plan to replace Obamacare's subsidies with less generous tax credits, hike the amount that insurers can charge older Americans and effectively eliminate Medicaid for low-income adults.\n\nThis package would leave many of those who gained coverage under Obamacare without coverage -- a direct contradiction to Trump's promise to provide \"insurance for everybody.\"\n\nTrump is also likely to address the health care law in his first prime time address to Congress on Tuesday night. As with any public remarks from the President, it has the potential to catch Republican lawmakers off guard and include unexpected promises or policy ideas that deviate from party line thinking.\n\nHouse GOP lawmakers are preparing to introduce their bill to repeal major portions of Obamacare, with a committee markup expected the week of March 6, leadership sources told CNN.\n\nRepublicans are still planning to include \"replacement\" measures in the repeal bill that involve the expansion of Health Savings Accounts, significant changes to Medicaid and tax credits, sources said.\n\nThe strategy allows the GOP to move simultaneously on repealing and replacing some parts of the healthcare law and attempt to quell widespread opposition to rolling back Obamacare without any clarity on an alternative.\n\nTop policy aides last week continued drafting legislative language while consulting with the Congressional Budget Office on how much elements of the bill would cost and how many people would be insured, according to sources. The price tag of the Obamacare repeal legislation and the impact on coverage will be critical to whether party leaders can sell the proposal to rank-and-file members across the board.\n\nThey are aiming to save $2 billion. Leaders are using a similar framework as a 2016 measure that directed two House committees crafting the bill to find a $1 billion each in savings from the current law -- a key promise that conservatives are sticking to.\n\nSelling the changes will be difficult, especially as Republicans make promises the health care system will improve.\n\nSpeaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, Trump argued that Obamacare \"covers very few people\" and took coverage away from \"millions of people\" who were happy with their previous plans.\n\n\"The bottom line -- we're changing it,\" Trump said. \"We're going to make it much better. We're going to make it less expensive. We're going make it much better. We're going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\"\n\nFuture of Medicaid\n\nMeanwhile, efforts to weaken Medicaid are already facing deep resistance from governors, including some Republicans who hail from states that expanded the program. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, for example, is publicly lobbying the Trump administration to preserve Medicaid expansion under Obamacare.\n\nAccording to the draft GOP repeal bill, Republican lawmakers are proposing eliminating the enhanced federal reimbursement for new Medicaid enrollees starting in 2020. This would cut the number of people covered under expansion over time.\n\nThe future of Medicaid was a prominent topic of discussion at a gathering of governors over the weekend in Washington. A group of governors sat down with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price to air their concerns about Obamacare repeal and potential changes Medicaid, though governors leaving the meeting said there were no concrete decisions.\n\nKasich, along with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam and Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, are also currently in talks to come up with a Medicaid plan that Republicans lawmakers and the White House could endorse.\n\nMedicaid is expected to be the focus of a meeting between governors and Trump at the White House on Monday.\n\nSelling the bill\n\nBoth Trump and GOP congressional leaders have the tough task of reassuring nervous lawmakers with a range of concerns about Obamacare.\n\nFor some lawmakers, the fear is that the recent explosion of angry town halls will begin to turn their colleagues against a wholesale repeal of the health care law.\n\n\"I don't know if we're going to be able to repeal Obamacare now because these folks who support Obamacare are very active, they're putting pressure on congressmen and there's not a counter-effort to steel the spine of some of these congressmen in tossup districts around the country,\" Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama said\n\n\"But this monstrosity needs to be repealed, and right now, in my judgment, we don't have the votes in Congress to pass a repeal bill, in part because of what these people are doing,\" he added.\n\nAt a raucous town hall, Rep. Tom Cotton of Arkansas was asked a pointed question about whether he would commit to replacing Obamacare.\n\n\"You talk a lot about the repeal, but you have not gone into specifics on replacement,\" the woman asked. \"Will you commit today to replacement protections for those Arkansans like me who will die or lose their quality of life or otherwise be unable to be participating citizens trying to get their part of the American dream?\"\n\nWhen Cotton attempted to move on to others in the audience without addressing the question, the crowd erupted into jeers and chants of \"Do your job! Do your job!\"\n\nCotton then responded: \"I'm committed to making sure that people with conditions as serious as yours or young healthy people all have access to affordable, quality, personalized care.\"", "date": "2017-02-27 00:00:00", "title": "GOP returns to daunting task of dismantling Obamacare, selling its plan to Trump"}

People are at risk of falling into this coverage gap when they are make too much money to qualify for Medicaid programs in states that chose not to expand their programs, but not enough to qualify for subsidized insurance on the federal health care exchanges.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was engineered to help people who were not covered by Medicaid expansion be able to afford coverage in the market place, but there are 19 states that had not expanded Medicaid eligibility . It is in those states that the coverage gap appears.\n\nAccording to a study by the Pew Charitable Trusts, 1.4 million of the 4 million Americans in the coverage gap are black. At the time of the study published in January 2015, 23 states had not expanded Medicaid, so the coverage gap may have shrunk since then.\n\nWhen Obamacare first rolled out, Latinos were less likely to enroll in the federal exchange , even though the administration put a lot of emphasis on reaching the Latino community -- with a Spanish-language site and a call center with representatives fluent in Spanish.\n\nIt would certainly be unfair to say that the Affordable Care Act has not helped many African-Americans gain coverage, but the legislation has helped more Latinos get coverage than any other group.\n\nVerdict: FALSE\n\nReality Check: Clinton on drug overdose deaths in New Hampshire\n\nFebruary 3, 2016\n\nBy Lisa Rose, CNN\n\nAfter taking a question on the topic of medical marijuana, Clinton expressed concern about substance abuse in New Hampshire.

About three-quarters of the slowdown was due to the weak economy, the Kaiser Family Foundation and Altarum Institute, a health research group, concluded in a 2013 report. The rest stemmed from efforts to keep spending down, including measures introduced under Obamacare.\n\nAlso, the growth rate of health care spending is on the rise. In 2014, expenditures grew by 5.3%, driven primarily by the 8.7 million people who gained health insurance through Obamacare and by rapidly rising prescription drug costs.

They come from the states that don't have the kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in New York.\"\n\nThe statistics on where guns used in crimes come from are complicated.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives recovered a total of 7,686 guns in 2014, but only 4,585 of those were traced back to the states where they were last registered. That means that a full 40% of those guns cannot be linked definitively to any state at all -- a fact that severely limits the validity of Clinton's claim.\n\nOf the 4,585 that can be linked to a state, more than 30% come from inside New York state itself.\n\nFurthermore, the ATF's database of traced weapons is itself limited to begin with. The ATF says \"not all firearms used in crime are traced and not all firearms traced are used in crime.\" So we don't even know that all of the guns traced were used in violent crimes, as Clinton implies. Because of the imperfections in the data set, the ATF says the data \"should not be considered representative of the larger universe of all firearms used by criminals.\" Even though the ATF's data is incomplete, it is still the best record of weapons that have been recovered by law enforcement and then traced.\n\nClinton avoided wading into more trouble by staying away from her statement earlier in the week that \"the state that has the highest per capita number of those guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont.\"\n\nOf the guns traced to a state, only 55, or just over 1%, were traced to Vermont. Her emphasis on the phrase \"per capita\" makes all the difference: just 55 of the 4,585 guns that the ATF traced in New York in 2014 came from Vermont. As a share of Vermont's total population of some 626,000, that ends up being 8.7 guns per 100,000 residents. South Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia are the next closest states with 5.3, 4.74, and 3.82 per capita, respectively.\n\nBoth during Thursday night's debate and in her comments last week, Clinton is making a claim that is a big leap based on the evidence available. But because the evidence is too incomplete to prove her wrong, our verdict has to be IT'S COMPLICATED.\n\nReality Check: Clinton on toy guns\n\nApril 14, 2016\n\nBy Lisa Rose, CNN\n\nDuring a contentious discussion of gun control, Clinton criticized Sanders for his vote supporting a 2005 law that protects firearms dealers and manufacturers from consumer lawsuits. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act limits the liability of gun companies when crime victims try to sue.\n\nClinton described the law as a \"gift\" to the gun industry. She declared, \"We have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.\"\n\nThere actually are not rigorous rules for toy gun manufacturers and sellers, beyond the usual consumer product safety protections. Imitation firearms like air rifles and BB guns must be marked with an orange tip, in accordance with a law passed in 1990, but there are no further federal regulations on the controversial toys.\n\nAlthough it's clear that Clinton was trying to punctuate her point by comparing manufacturers of real guns with those of fake guns, her suggestion that there are tough standards for toy guns is, at the very least, an overstatement.\n\nVerdict: FALSE.\n\nReality Check: Clinton on gun used in Sandy Hook shootings\n\nMarch 3, 2016\n\nBy Sonam Vashi, CNN\n\nSpeaking about the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Hillary Clinton said, \"I want people in this audience to think about what it must feel like to send off your first-grader, little backpack maybe on his or her back, and then the next thing you hear is that somebody has come to that school using an automatic weapon, an AR-15, and murdered those children.\"\n\nOn December 14, 2012, 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed 20 first-graders and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\nLanza brought three guns into the school and left one in his car , according to search warrants and a statement from a top prosecutor.\n\nThe weapons were:\n\n- A semiautomatic Bushmaster XM-15 rifle , which is a brand name of a type of an AR-15, was the primary rifle used;\n\n- A Glock 10 mm handgun;\n\n- A Sig Sauer P226 9 mm handgun;\n\n- And a 12-gauge shotgun that Lanza left in his car.\n\nAll of the weapons were purchased legally by Lanza's mother, who Lanza shot and killed at their home before the shooting at Sandy Hook.\n\nWhen the trigger of an automatic weapon is pulled , the gun will constantly fire bullets until pressure is removed from the trigger, or until the magazine is empty. In semiautomatic mode, only one bullet is released when the trigger is pulled. To fire another bullet, the trigger must be pulled again.\n\nClinton says that Lanza used an automatic weapon, when the AR-15 used by Lanza was a semi-automatic.\n\nVerdict: FALSE.\n\nReality Check: Clinton on incarceration rate of black men in Wisconsin\n\nFebruary 11, 2016\n\nBy Eve Bower, CNN\n\nIn response to a question about the high rate of incarceration of black men in Wisconsin, Clinton said, \"the statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.\"\n\nA 2013 study from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee supports Clinton's claim. The study found that in April 2010 \"12.8% (or 1-in-8) African-American working age men were behind bars in state prisons and local jails,\" and that this rate was \"the highest for African-American men in the country and nearly double the national average of 6.7% (or 1-in-15).\"\n\nThe study further found that Wisconsin incarcerated Native American men at a higher rate than any other state, with 7.6% of working age men behind bars, compared to an average 3.1% of Native American men incarcerated nationwide.\n\nWisconsin's white men were incarcerated at a slightly lower rate than their counterparts nationwide, at 1.2% and 1.3%, respectively, the study found.\n\nThe NAACP lists policies that promoted \"get tough on crime\" and the \"war on drugs\" as being among the chief contributing factors to the racial disparities in incarceration rates in the United States today.\n\nDuring her tenure as first lady, during a period of high crime rates, Clinton spoke in support of these policies. In an August 1994 speech promoting then-President Bill Clinton's crime bill, Hillary Clinton \"applauded\" the New York City Police Department for its efforts \"driving drug dealers out of New York,\" and highlighting the \"many dollars in the crime bill to build more prisons.\"\n\nOnce Clinton became a senator from New York, she appears to have changed her view.\n\nIn 2007, she co-sponsored a bill to eliminate the five-year mandatory minimum sentence for first-time possession of crack cocaine and increase funding for drug treatment programs for incarcerated people. While campaigning for president later that year, she also advocated programs to divert non-violent drug offenders away from prison.\n\nVerdict: TRUE", "date": "2016-09-25 00:00:00", "title": "Hillary Clinton on criminal justice: CNN's Reality Check vets the claims"}

Trump's selection to run the Housing and Urban Development Department, Ben Carson, said he was disappointed in the move during his confirmation hearing. What's more, it was a decision, announced by Obama's HUD Secretary Julian Castro, which was made without consulting Trump's team first, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nBut the speed with which it occurred -- less than an hour after Trump took the oath of office last week -- surprised even plugged-in lobbyists, congressional staffers and housing officials, according to a series of interviews with stakeholders by CNN.\n\n\"Had no idea,\" said one lobbyist with a laugh. \"None.\"\n\n\"Wasn't expecting it -- and have absolutely no insight into how it all happened,\" said another.\n\n\"Knew it was coming eventually, but damn,\" mused a congressional staffer. \"That was quick.\"\n\nCarson hasn't been confirmed yet. Trump still hasn't even named his own Federal Housing Administration commissioner -- the individual responsible for overseeing the portfolio the fees effect. Most interviewed were perplexed as to who at the agency actually had the power to pull the trigger on something like this.\n\nThe content of the Trump administration's decision to reverse the decision, at least according to Democrats, was even more problematic. The cut itself is designed to ease the home buying process for first time and low-income homebuyers. It was a decision made amid intense pressure from advocacy groups, according to two people familiar with the process -- one final effort by the administration to bolster that specific group of borrowers on Obama's way out the door.\n\nThe Trump team's move, especially so quickly after inauguration, infuriated Democrats.\n\n\"It took only an hour after his positive words on the inaugural platform for his actions to ring hollow,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor just a few hours later. \"One hour after talking about helping working people and ending the cabal in Washington that hurts people, he signs a regulation that makes it more expensive for new homeowners to buy mortgages.\"\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Banking Committee, tweeted shortly after: \"Making it more expensive for Americans to buy their first homes is not the way to make Washington work for people.\"\n\nBut Trump's team, in part out of necessity, and in part, according to sources, to make a point to the departing team at the organization, was prepared to pull the trigger on the shift as soon as Trump placed his hand on the two bibles he used for his swearing in.\n\nThe primary reason the action was taken immediately was simple, according to multiple people familiar with the process: because it could be done immediately. Unlike most federal rule changes, HUD can operate not only unilaterally on the decision, but without going through traditional rule-making process of doing things like placing the change in the Federal Register for review. A simple letter informing stake holders is all it took to take the action. No official rule-making. No executive orders. Just a letter.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump signs 3 executive actions Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump signs 3 executive actions 02:07\n\nIt was also done for marketplace reasons. The cut was supposed to take effect on January 27. If the decision was going to be made, better to make it before lenders started utilizing the cut than after.\n\n\"They did it this way so, quite frankly, all the lenders brokers and machinery didn't bake the wrong premiums into the cake,\" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the former chief economist of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic advisers and then director of the Congressional Budget Office. \"This is the efficient way to get it fixed as opposed to put it into effect\" and having lenders have to backtrack later.\n\nThe move was also deliberately telegraphed in advance, according to one official who worked on the process.\n\nTwo GOP senators made a point of asking Carson questions about the issue during his confirmation hearing -- an effort to lay the groundwork for the eventual move, the official said.\n\nRepublicans had made no secret of their disdain for the Obama administration's decision. The reasons are two-fold: The cut reduces the government's cushion backing the mortgages. By targeting lower-income borrowers, it also makes the makeup of the risk pool worse. Even lobbyists whose members would benefit from the cut knew where things were headed under Trump.\n\n\"It was relatively clear where a lot of Republicans in Congress stood,\" one told CNN.\n\nTrump's landing teams, which had arrived at HUD weeks ago, had targeted the reversal early on the process, a person familiar with the process said.\n\nApart from the logistical and policy reasons, another was general frustration with Obama's decision to make the cut at all. Obama's team hadn't consulted with Trump's before making the move -- or even told them it was coming, the person said. Carson hinted at that frustration during his confirmation hearing.\n\n\"I was surprised to see something of this nature done on the way out the door,\" he told lawmakers.\n\nAs to who actually did it?\n\nGenger Charles, HUD's general deputy assistant secretary for Housing, signed the letter and is one of the agency's staffers the Trump administration has asked to stay on for at least the near term. Widely respected internally, Charles sent the letter because of her position at the agency. The decision itself was made by Trump's incoming team explicitly, even as where many will end up is still largely unknown or still in the works.\n\nStill, as one put it bluntly (and accurately): \"We're in charge now.\"", "date": "2017-01-23 00:00:00", "title": "How (and why) Trump's first formal policy action actually happened"}

The Department of Homeland Security was left making a legal analysis on the order after Trump signed it. A Border Patrol agent, confronted with arriving refugees, referred questions only to the President himself, according to court filings.\n\nSaturday night, a federal judge granted an emergency stay for citizens of the affected countries who had already arrived in the US and those who are in transit and hold valid visas, ruling they can legally enter the US.\n\nTrump's unilateral moves, which have drawn the ire of human rights groups and prompted protests at US airports, reflect the President's desire to quickly make good on his campaign promises. But they also encapsulate the pitfalls of an administration largely operated by officials with scant federal experience.\n\nIt wasn't until Friday -- the day Trump signed the order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspending all refugee admission for 120 days -- that career homeland security staff were allowed to see the final details of the order, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe result was widespread confusion across the country on Saturday as airports struggled to adjust to the new directives.

Gang members, drug dealers & others are being removed!\n\nIt was the uncertainty, the publicity of the raids and the high tensions raised by public comments on immigration by Trump administration officials that had Democrats asking for more information.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Lou Correa fsent a letter to immigration officials, outlining the unanswered questions related to the latest immigration enforcement actions.\n\n\"These activities have caused fear and uncertainty for many of constituents,\" Correa wrote, and listed 10 questions for ICE, among them \"What are the agency's priorities for removal? and \"How far in advance were these enforcement activities planned?\"\n\nDavid Marin, Los Angeles field office director for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said planning for the immigration operation carried out this week began during the Obama administration.\n\n\"This operation was in the planning stages before the current administration issued its executive order,\" Marin told reporters Friday. Trump signed an executive order regarding detention of undocumented immigrants on January 25. Marin said generally it takes weeks of planning before an operation is carried out because the agency needs the time to develop case targets and leads.\n\nOfficials are trying to stress that these actions are consistent with regular enforcement.\n\n\"We do these operations two to three times a year,\" Marin said. \"This is on par with past operations.\"\n\nImmigration activists are concerned, however, that these raids may have targeted a wider scope of individuals than had been common in the Obama administration.\n\nSeparately, a former Obama administration ICE official said that administration \"targeted felons,\" and noted that under the Trump administration, the enforcement priorities laid out in his interior executive order were much broader and could include a wider range of targets than the Obama administration's enforcement priorities.\n\nThe official also questioned the Trump administration including in its general targets individuals with previous deportation orders. These are undocumented immigrants who went through court proceedings before and had a final order of removal, but had not been deported by the previous administration. The Los Angeles ICE office confirmed among its arrests five had no criminal histories but prior orders of removal.\n\n\"We ultimately decided those people were not a priority as there are literally millions of them and most have never committed any crime,\" the official said referring to violent crimes or felonies.\n\nThe official said that one appeal of targeting individuals with removal orders is that they can be deported \"quickly,\" because no further court action would be necessary.\n\nOperation leads to nationwide arrests\n\nICE in Los Angeles said it had conducted a five-day operation targeting criminals and fugitives, and said that the vast majority of those arrested had criminal histories.\n\nSeeking to push back on reports of indiscriminate raids, ICE released the results of the operation from its Los Angeles office, saying about 160 foreign nationals were arrested during the week. Of those, 150 had criminal histories, and of the remaining arrests, five had final orders of removal or were previously deported. Ninety-five percent were male, they said.\n\nA Homeland Security official told CNN on Saturday that 37 of those detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in California this week as part of the enforcement crackdown have now been deported to Mexico. The official said they had already been deported and had come back to the country illegally or had deportation orders against them. This group did not have to go through the adjudication process because they had already received deportation orders, the official said.\n\nWhile specific numbers weren't available, ICE said \"many\" of the arrested individuals had prior felony convictions including violent charges like child sex crimes, weapons or assault charges.\n\nAn ICE official confirmed Atlanta had conducted a similar surge this week, and roughly 200 arrests were made in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina in a similar routine enforcement action. Texas Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro said in a statement that he had confirmed with ICE's San Antonio field office that similar actions were conducted across Texas, calling the action \"Operation Cross Check.\" He said he would be following up to make sure the actions were targeting the worst offenders.\n\nThe Chicago ICE office said similar actions in the Midwest netted more than 200 arrests in the states of Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Kansas and Missouri. While Chicago said the targets were fugitives and criminals, the only data available about the individuals arrested was that the \"majority\" had prior criminal convictions.\n\nSome arrested during the Midwest sweep \"will face criminal prosecutions by the US attorney's office for illegal entry and illegal re-entry after deportation,\" the office said.\n\nDemocrats, immigrant activists react\n\nStill, as Trump continues to talk about cracking down on illegal immigration, advocates remain concerned that the new administration could be stepping up enforcement against otherwise peaceful undocumented immigrants.\n\nOn Thursday, protests sprang up at the deportation of Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, a 35-year-old mother of two, who had checked in with ICE at an office in Phoenix the day before, as she had regularly since a 2008 conviction of using a fake Social Security number.\n\nFriday, Democrats decried the actions nationwide as needlessly causing fear for immigrant communities.\n\n\"These reports show the serious consequences of the president's executive order, which allows all undocumented immigrants to be categorized as criminals and requires increased enforcement in communities, rather than prioritizing dangerous criminals,\" California Sen. Dianne Feinstein said in a statement responding to media reports of the stepped up enforcement, including some accounts that the actions were targeting low-priority undocumented immigrants, including family men and women.\n\n\"The President wants to show off and it appears he has unleashed the Department of Homeland Security to kick-out large numbers of immigrants and anyone they encounter, without much oversight, review or due process,\" said Illinois Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez. \"The goal of such policies is to inject fear into immigrant communities, frighten families and children, and drive immigrants farther underground. It damages public safety and the fabric of American communities while putting a burden on local social services and the foster-care system.\"\n\nGutierrez's concerns were echoed by Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, a Democrat from California.\n\n\"I am outraged to hear of the recent ICE arrests in southern California. If the Trump administration is genuinely concerned about threats to American security, it should prioritize violent felons and others who pose real danger,\" Roybal-Allard said in a statement. \"My office has been working to get detailed information from ICE.\"\n\nAnd a city councilman from Austin, Texas, said he was concerned that ICE was making a public show of force in his city as retribution for being a sanctuary city.\n\n\"ICE actions like these are beyond reprehensible,\" Greg Casar said in a statement. \"They instill fear in the community, and they make everyday people fear for their lives.\"\n\nTrump's campaign promises on immigration\n\nTrump made cracking down on illegal immigration a central focus of his presidential campaign.\n\nWhile ICE characterized the actions as routine, fear remains that the Trump administration's recent executive order beefing up interior enforcement of immigration laws could mean a vast expansion of deportations of undocumented immigrants.\n\nWhile the Obama administration had clear guidance prioritizing deportation of high-level criminals, an executive order signed by Trump in his first week set up enforcement priorities that could include virtually any undocumented immigrant living in the US.\n\nOn Saturday, the President defend another part of his campaign promise on immigration, vowing to keep costs down on a border wall that would span the US southern border with Mexico.\n\n\"I am reading that the great border WALL will cost more than the government originally thought, but I have not gotten involved in the ... design or negotiations yet. When I do, just like with the F-35 FighterJet or the Air Force One Program, price will come WAY DOWN!\" Trump wrote in two consecutive tweets.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said overall about the agency's actions that everything is \"routine,\" and are not part of casting a widespread net.\n\n\"ICE Fugitive Operations teams are out every day as part of routine, targeted enforcement operations,\" said acting press secretary Gillian Christensen. \"These are existing, established fugitive operations teams. ICE does not conduct sweeps or raids that target aliens indiscriminately. ICE only conducts targeted enforcement of criminal aliens and other individuals who are in violation of our nation's immigration laws.\"\n\nDHS secretary John Kelly told reporters at San Ysidro Port of Entry between San Diego and Tijuana on Friday that his department isn't \"rounding anyone up.\"\n\n\"The people that ICE apprehend are people who are illegal and then some,\" he said. \"ICE is executing the law and I would tell you I've been around a lot of pretty darn good men and women in the armed forces and what I saw today, the professionalism that I personally observed in a very potentially dangerous environment gave me great pride.\"", "date": "2017-02-10 00:00:00", "title": "Democrats, advocates question ICE enforcement raids"}

On Friday, President Barack Obama will complete his second term in office and cease to be the sitting president, transferring the authority of his office to his elected successor, Trump.\n\nAt noon, Trump will become the President and Vice President-elect Mike Pence will become the sitting vice president.\n\nTrump will take the oath of office administered by Chief Justice John Roberts and deliver a speech commemorating the occasion.\n\nAnd as is tradition , the President and vice president will lead a parade to the White House after their inauguration.\n\nWhat else is going on this weekend?\n\nThe inauguration ceremony is sandwiched amidst days of events, including lavish dinners, the parade and concerts.\n\nThursday kicks off the first performances organized by Trump's inaugural committee.\n\nAn event billed as \"The Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration\" will be at Lincoln Memorial at 4 p.m. ET and open to the public. Artists including Toby Keith, 3 Doors Down and Lee Greenwood are scheduled to perform.\n\nThe inaugural committee also announced another pre-inaugural celebration, called \"Voices of the People,\" which the team said \"will feature groups from the hundreds of applications received by the Presidential Inaugural Committee to take part in inaugural festivities.\"\n\nAfter Friday's official ceremonies, inaugural balls are also part of the week's traditions. Trump will attend three balls : two inaugural balls and a ball \"saluting armed services and first responders.\"\n\nFirst peek at inaugural week:\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Welcome rally\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Parade\n\n\u2611\ufe0f 2 inaugural balls\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Ball saluting armed services & first responders\n\n#41Days \u2014 Trump Inauguration (@TrumpInaugural) December 9, 2016\n\nDidn't get an invite to one of the official balls but still want a night on the town? A number of organizations sell tickets to their own balls during inauguration week. Here's a list of some of them from USA Today.\n\nThere are also a number of pro- and anti-Trump rallies scheduled for this weekend; the Department of Homeland Security expects as many as 99 groups to gather this weekend. Organizers from the Women's March on Washington said they were expecting upwards of 200,000 people for their event.\n\nHow do I watch on CNN?\n\nCNN will bring full coverage of the inauguration and all the goings-on in the nation's capital that weekend, both online and on TV.\n\nJUST WATCHED Things that come up often in inaugural speeches Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Things that come up often in inaugural speeches 03:22\n\nOfficial inauguration coverage on television begins at 5 a.m. ET live from Washington and will continue through the inaugural events. CNN will carry the official ceremonies like the swearing-in, the parade, the inaugural balls and all the official events as well as coverage of protests, executive actions and everything else that happens throughout the weekend.\n\nTelevision coverage will come on CNN, CNNI and CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. Live streaming will be available right on CNN's homepage and apps starting at 6 a.m. ET on Friday.\n\nAdditionally, CNN Politics will have a live blog for instant coverage and analysis on Inauguration Day and the women's march on Saturday.\n\nCan I still get tickets to go to the inauguration?\n\nIt depends on how close to the action you want to be. Anybody can go watch for free from the National Mall.\n\nBut watching from the West Front of the Capitol Building requires a ticket. The inaugural event itself is a tightly formal affair on Capitol Hill and attendance is managed by a bipartisan team of congressional leaders and the President-elect's inaugural committee. Members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, members of the transition team, family members and other invited guests can attend, with some sitting on the inaugural platform where the President takes the oath office.\n\nFormer presidents and their families have also agreed to attend, including former President Bill Clinton and former secretary of state and first lady Hillary Clinton, who Trump defeated in the election.\n\nFormer President George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara Bush, had agreed to attend, but they have both been in the hospital since Saturday. Their eldest son, former President George W. Bush was still going to attend the inauguration, the senior Bush's spokesman said.\n\nEveryone else has to get tickets from their members of Congress, which are necessarily limited. Members of the House and Senate each receive tickets from the Joint Congressional Committee for the ceremonies. Members of the House and Senate distribute tickets to those who have applied. Competition can be fierce because more people generally apply for tickets than are available.\n\nExact times and methods for distribution vary from member to member, but less than a week ahead of the inauguration, it is unlikely for anyone new to score tickets to the area closest to the inaugural platform.\n\nWhat's the weather forecast look like?\n\nPack your ponchos -- according to the National Weather Service , it's looking like a high of 47\u02da with a 90% chance of rain on Friday.\n\nFor those planning on joining the women's march or looking to do sightseeing, Saturday's forecast is 56\u02da and cloudy.\n\nWhat about the Women's March?\n\nThe Women's March on Washington, a protest against Trump, is on Saturday. It is scheduled to begin with a rally at 10 a.m., followed by the march at 1:15 p.m. The group says not only women are invited -- anyone who thinks \"women's rights are human rights\" is welcome.\n\nThe Women's March starts at the intersection of Independence Avenue SW and Third Street SW. From there, the march will make its way to the area between the Ellipse and the Washington Monument, just south of the White House.\n\nHow is the security situation?\n\nSecurity will be a massive presence in the nation's capital. Homeland Security estimated about 28,000 personnel from many different agencies would join in for the job.\n\nWhere will the Obamas be?\n\nThe president and the first lady will attend the swearing-in ceremony, then they have planned to head to Palm Springs\n\nBut soon, they will settle into their new home in a swanky DC neighborhood , not too far from the White House.\n\nTrump's eldest daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, an incoming White House member, have also reportedly staked out a home in the same neighborhood.\n\nHow have inaugurations gone in the past?\n\nPresident Andrew Jackson is said to have thrown a wild party and even escaped through a White House window to avoid the chaos. President William Henry Harrison caught pneumonia that led to his early death in office.\n\nThe drama is not just limited to Democrats though. Here's a roundup of fun facts\n\nWhat will Trump say?\n\nWe don't know what the speech is yet, and knowing Trump, it could include some improvised moments anyway.\n\nBut the oath of office itself is a short, but solemn affair transferring power to the president.\n\nAnd here's a taste from one of the greats -- both of Lincoln's addresses are highly regarded by historians\n\nWhat will Trump eat?\n\nIn the morning, he'll have tea with the Obamas. Then, after taking the oath, Trump will have lunch with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Here's Trump's inaugural lunch menu . He has said he's not a drinker, but it looks like the rest of the attendees will have plenty of California wine.\n\nWho will not be going?\n\nReps. Barbara Lee and John Lewis, progressive Democrats, announced they would not attend the inauguration. After Lewis said Trump was not a \"legitimate\" president, Trump attacked the Civil Rights icon for days.\n\nCongressman John Lewis chats with audience attending Nashville Public Library Award to Civil Rights Icon\n\nHow many people will be attending?\n\nIt's always hard to estimate crowd sizes, but many hundreds of thousands could show.", "date": "2017-01-17 00:00:00", "title": "Everything you need to know about Trump's inauguration, weekend protests"}

It also noisily disrupted what was meant to be an easygoing weekend of high-level male bonding with the more sobering aspects of global diplomacy.\n\nSitting alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom he'd spent most of the day golfing, Trump took the call on a mobile phone at his table, which was set squarely in the middle of the private club's dining area.\n\nThis was the first missile test by Pyongyang since US President Donald Trump took office.\n\nThis was the first missile test by Pyongyang since US President Donald Trump took office.\n\nKim celebrates with soldiers after the missile test, which North Korean state media claimed was successful.\n\nKim celebrates with soldiers after the missile test, which North Korean state media claimed was successful.\n\nKim was present at the site and personally gave the order for the launch, state media reported.\n\nKim was present at the site and personally gave the order for the launch, state media reported.\n\nThe Pukguksong-2 was launched on Sunday, according to North Korean state media.\n\nThe Pukguksong-2 was launched on Sunday, according to North Korean state media.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un looks on as the country tests a new intermediate-range ballistic missile.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un looks on as the country tests a new intermediate-range ballistic missile.\n\nAs Mar-a-Lago's wealthy members looked on from their tables, and with a keyboard player crooning in the background, Trump and Abe's evening meal quickly morphed into a strategy session, the decision-making on full view to fellow diners, who described it in detail to CNN.\n\nNews of Pyongyang's launch had emerged an hour earlier, as Trump was preparing for dinner in his residence. Officials had concluded the Musudan-level missile flew 310 miles off North Korea's eastern coast before crashing into the Sea of Japan.\n\nFor the new commander in chief, the launch was his first brush with the hermit regime's saber-rattling, which along with heated rhetoric from the young leader Kim Jong-un has spooked the country's neighbors. During his pre-election intelligence briefings, Trump requested supplemental information about North Korea from US intelligence officials. National security analysts have identified the nation's nuclear program as one of the imminent threats facing Trump as he begins his tenure in the White House.\n\nIn his talks with Abe at the White House on Friday, the North Korea threat weighed heavily. Abe said during a concluding news conference that he and Trump had agreed to \"strongly demand\" the country \"abandon (its) nuclear and ballistic missile program.\" They departed a short time later for Florida.\n\nOn Saturday evening, as the two men walked through Mar-a-Lago's ornate wrought-iron doors on their way to dinner, neither responded to questions about the launch from reporters.\n\nSwanning through the club's living room and main dining area alongside Abe, Trump was -- as is now typical -- swarmed with paying members, who now view dinner at the club as an opportunity for a few seconds of face time with the new President.\n\nBut as he sat down for the planned working dinner with Abe, whose country is well within range of North Korea's missiles, it was clear his counterpart felt it necessary to respond to the test. The launch occurred just before 8 a.m. on Sunday morning in Japan.\n\nTrump's national security adviser Michael Flynn and chief strategist Steve Bannon left their seats to huddle closer to Trump as documents were produced and phone calls were placed to officials in Washington and Tokyo.\n\nPresidents always travel with secure communications equipment, even when they're on vacation. A Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, known as a SCIFF, also comes along. The tent-like structure can fit inside a hotel room and allows a president to conduct sensitive phone calls without the risk of being detected by recording devices.\n\nAt Mar-a-Lago on Saturday, it had not been immediately clear whether Trump utilized that equipment, but White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Monday he had.\n\n\"The President was briefed in a SCIFF prior to dinner,\" Spicer told reporters Monday. \"They were reviewing the logistics for the press conference ... President was subsequently briefed in a classified setting.\"\n\nOn Saturday night, the patio was lit only with candles and moonlight, so aides used the camera lights on their phones to help the stone-faced Trump and Abe read through the documents.\n\nJUST WATCHED N.

Earlier in the day, the women had toured a nearby Japanese garden and visited the gothic Bethesda-by-the-Sea church, where Trump and his wife were married in 2005.\n\nEventually Trump and Abe, along with their collection of aides, stood and moved from the dining terrace and toward a marble-trimmed ballroom, whose gilded columns were concealed by more sober-looking black drapes.\n\nStanding in front of an American and Japanese flag, a stern-faced Abe called the launch \"absolutely intolerable,\" and insisted North Korea adhere to United Nations Security Council resolutions barring it from testing of ballistic missiles.\n\nTrump, in his short remarks, didn't mention the launch.

Those remarks did mention the missile test specifically and vowed cooperation between allies to \"safeguard and protect\" against North Korea's \"provocative acts.\"\n\n\"That was a joint statement we decided not to make,\" a senior administration official said afterward, explaining why those remarks were cast aside. Because Abe spoke first, and then Trump, there was \"no need for communique,\" the official said.\n\nTrump left the impromptu briefing room without taking questions, having delivered the first emergency foreign policy statement of his presidency,\n\nBut even as he confronted one of the gravest matters of his office, Trump nonetheless found it impossible to resist dropping in on a nearby wedding reception, already underway in his treasured Grand Ballroom.

You and I have talked about this before. We need an outright repeal of Obamacare and then whatever's gonna come after it, fine, let's have that discussion.

Bill Haslam of Tennessee, whose states did not expand Medicaid under the law; and two governors from states that did: Kasich and Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval.

It truly is up to us. We have to decide whether we all will work together so we all can rise together.\"\n\nTurning to national security, Clinton warned that a president has to make decisions about war and peace, life and death.\n\n\"Ask yourself: Do you really think Donald Trump has the temperament to be commander in chief? Donald Trump can't even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign.\"\n\nShe added: \"A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.\"\n\nTrump hit back -- with a series of tweets.\n\n\"No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes,\" he wrote. \"Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.\"\n\nStephen Miller, Trump's senior policy adviser, blasted Clinton's speech as an \"insulting collection of cliches and recycled rhetoric.\"\n\n\"She spent the evening talking down to the American people she's looked down on her whole life,\" he said.\n\nPersuading Americans\n\nBut Clinton is working to persuade Americans that she understands their frustration and economic anxiety at a time when many of them still do not trust her. Her prime-time televised address is especially crucial because she has not so far generated the kind of passion among her supporters that Trump has garnered from his backers by channeling anger about the direction of the country.\n\nShe spoke of her wholesome middle class upbringing and said her family were builders of the American dream and not people \"with their name on big buildings\" -- another dig at Trump.\n\nClinton took pains to reach out to white blue-collar workers, many of whom have been left behind by economic globalization and technological change and have been attracted by Trump's anti-elite message.\n\n\"Right now, an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do,\" she said, and admitted that politicians had not done a good enough job of showing they understand.\n\nOne of the major themes of the Democratic convention has been an attempt to reintroduce one of the most famous women in the world to the American people. And she admitted that if many Americans knew little of the woman behind the image, it may be her fault.\n\n\"The truth is, through all these years of public service, the 'service' part has always come easier to me than the 'public' part,\" Clinton said.\n\nClinton also indicated she understood the need to reassure Americans shaken by a violent summer at home and an epidemic of terror attacks in Europe and the US. While Clinton and Obama have argued that ISIS is on the run, the economy is on the upswing, and Americans are safer than they have been in years, they are struggling to counter the dark image that Trump has painted of a nation in decline, chaos and disorder that resonates with many voters.\n\nNational security threats\n\nAmid charges by Republicans that the optimistic mood of the Democratic convention has ignored the threat from ISIS and terrorism, Clinton was specific about the global national security threats that loom -- though she didn't use the term Islamic terrorism as the GOP repeatedly has called for.\n\n\"Anyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face,\" Clinton said. \"From Baghdad to Kabul, to Nice to Paris and Brussels. From San Bernardino to Orlando, we're dealing with determined enemies who must be defeated. No wonder people are anxious and looking for reassurance -- looking for steady leadership.\"\n\nFollowing a spate of killings by police of African-American youths and massacres of police officers, Clinton laid out a firm stance on gun control, vowing that America should not have a president in the \"pocket\" of the gun lobby.\n\n\"I'm not here to take away your guns,\" she said. \"I just don't want you to be shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun in the first place.\"\n\nAhead of her speech, retired four star General John Allen, the former head of US and international forces in Afghanistan, delivered a powerful address in which he told delegates that Clinton would be \"exactly the Commander-in-Chief America needs.\"\n\n'America will continue to lead'\n\n\"With her as our Commander-in-Chief, America will continue to lead this volatile world. We will oppose and resist tyranny and we will defeat evil. America will defeat ISIS and protect the homeland,\" said Allen, who was surrounded on stage by 37 military veterans.\n\nClinton delivered her speech at the end of a largely successful convention, which helped mend the party after her divisive primary against Sanders.

{"sourceurl": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/25/politics/governors-medicaid/index.html", "sourcename": "cnn", "response_body": "(CNN) A group of governors huddled Saturday with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in Washington to air their concerns on Medicaid and the effort to repeal Obamacare.\n\nThe meeting comes two days before governors are set to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House, where worries about the Obamacare replacement are expected to dominate the discussion.\n\nPrice only briefly talked about his meeting Saturday as he dashed out of the room, surrounded by staffers, calling it \"a good, candid exchange.\" The Health and Human Services Department later said in a release that \"they discussed real, positive solutions.\"\n\nGovernors said afterward that much of the focus was on how to treat states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and those that didn't fairly.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin told reporters afterward that Price was in a \"listening mode\" and did not say which items Trump would support or oppose.\n\n\"He's in a listening mode right now, and certainly has talked about partnership with the states, listening to different challenges we face as governors,\" she said.\n\nGovernors also heard presentations from consulting firms McKinsey & Co. and Avalere Health. The analyses, first reported by Vox, showed that many people would not be able to afford coverage if the GOP gave them tax credits based on age instead of Obamacare's subsidies based on income. Even more low-income residents would lose access to Medicaid coverage under the Republicans' plan to change federal funding levels. McKinsey also discussed potential options -- such as enhanced federal funding for state innovation grants -- that could lower premiums and boost enrollment.\n\nGovernors discussed whether Medicaid would be turned into a block-grant program or a per capita program, in which states would receive fixed funding based on the number of enrollees. They also discussed possibly compensating states that did not expand Medicaid.\n\nKentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, who has been in regular talks with the Trump White House about how to handle any Obamacare replacement, called the discussions of policy \"gelatinous.\"\n\n\"That's your word of the day,\" said Bevin, who has a proposed overhaul to Kentucky's Medicaid expansion program pending before HHS. \"It is this sort of amorphous thing that has yet to gel up, and until it does, we don't know what it will look like.\"\n\nRepublicans have convened a group of 10 governors (and their Medicaid directors) from five states that expanded Medicaid and five that did not to talk about how they should handle Medicaid, Fallin said.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, started the group a few weeks ago and said that they have been talking regularly by phone. Bevin and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson are also part of the group.\n\nCongressional Republicans have also asked Walker, Ohio Gov. John Kasich , Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval and Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam to come up with a deal to resolve the expansion problem.\n\nChanging Medicaid into a per-capita funding program and eliminating expansion could reduce federal spending by $1.4 trillion over 10 years, according to Avalere's analysis. Governors are wary of overhauling Medicaid because it's the largest source of federal funding for states.\n\nRepublican governors also have grown increasingly skittish about the fate of their low-income residents who gained coverage under Medicaid expansion -- as well as the future. Some 11 million adults are now insured in the 31 states, plus the District of Columbia, that expanded Medicaid. Sixteen of those states are run by Republicans.\n\n\"I think the concern of governors alike, not just Republican governors, but governors on either side of the aisle is: Give us a base, give us a foundation upon which we could help slow the curve. But you can't cut Medicaid. There's no way about it,\" Walker told The Washington Post on Friday.\n\nRepublicans have been feeling pressure across the country as Democratic protesters have flooded town halls hosted by Republican lawmakers -- yelling, screaming and chanting over the legislators and at times telling deeply personal stories about their health care.\n\nHutchinson, who expanded Medicaid, cited the surprising town hall hosted by Sen. Tom Cotton earlier this week in northwest Arkansas.\n\n\"Any time you have 2,000 Arkansans show up at a town hall meeting, that gets people's attention, and particularly politicians. And I think you have to understand that this is reflecting voter intensity. They are very concerned,\" Hutchinson told CNN Saturday.\n\n\"There's nothing more precious to you then health care, whether you have an individual policy or whether it's an employer policy or whether it's Medicaid.\"", "date": "2017-02-25 00:00:00", "title": "Governors mull Medicaid expansion"}

He followed a long tradition of presidents using unilateral moves to bypass resistant lawmakers.\n\nHere are some things to know about President Trump's unilateral moves -- what they can accomplish and what they can't.\n\nExecutive Order\n\nAn executive order is an official document signed by the president that declares government policy. In an executive order, a president is giving instructions to government agencies and departments about how to operate in a certain area.\n\nAn executive order is legally binding, and written into the official journal of the government, the Federal Register . Each executive order is numbered.\n\nExecutive orders cannot reverse a law passed by Congress. Limited in scope, their sweep isn't as broad as a piece of legislation.\n\nPresident Trump can overturn any of President Obama's executive orders, just as Trump's successor can overturn anything he signs while in office.\n\nWhat would this look life in real life?\n\nPresident Obama used a memorandum to start the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which was intended to bring people brought to the US illegally as children the ability to come out of the shadows.\n\nHe couldn't give them citizenship or make them permanently legal without Congress, but he did give them a temporary legal status. President Trump could just as easily rescind this policy.\n\nIt's a two-way street between Republicans and Democrats. President Obama, for instance, in his first days in office, rolled back a ban on types of stem cell research that had been in place by an executive order of President George W. Bush.\n\nHow often are executive orders used?\n\nThe number of executive orders each president has issued varies. President Obama issued 277 executive orders during his two terms in office. George W. Bush issued 291, Bill Clinton 364, and Ronald Reagan 381.\n\nThe most for any presidency was Franklin D. Roosevelt, who issued 3,721 executive orders over his twelve year tenure.\n\nWhat's the difference between and executive order and an executive action?\n\nAn executive action is a broader term, describing all types of unilateral moves by a president. That can include executive orders, but it also includes proclamations, memorandums, and proposals.\n\nExecutive actions carry varying legal weight. Directives and memorandums \u2014 used to inform federal agencies of administration policy \u2014 do carry the same legal effect as an executive order, according to a Justice Department statement from 2009.\n\nBut proclamations are more ceremonial, and often don't carry legal weight.\n\nThe actions are often controversial. Since the Constitution doesn't spell out any specific terms for how and when they can be used, executive actions are ripe for legal challenges.\n\nHow are executive actions used?\n\nPresident Obama utilized some of these other types of executive actions with more frequency than executive orders. Presidential memos aren't always publicly released and they influence policy less overtly than executive orders. He used these types of memos to extend federal benefits to same-sex domestic partners, for instance. The Washington Post charted many of his actions as opposed to his orders.\n\nTrump could easily roll back some of these. He started with reversing Obama's executive order that reversed George W. Bush's policy. Obama's move allowed US funding for some international groups that used non-US funding to provide abortions. Trump's will ban it.\n\nCongress can meddle in a President's executive authority by restricting funding for a certain program or writing a law that explicitly prevents an executive order from taking effect.\n\nEach president also has the authority to reverse executive actions that previous commanders-in-chief have handed down.\n\nExecutive orders and actions pale in comparison to laws passed by Congress\n\nUnlike executive actions, a law begins in Congress as a bill, is passed by both the House and Senate, and is signed by the president.\n\nPresidents have long said they prefer to govern through legislation, since laws passed by Congress can be broader in scope, and have a better chance of standing up over time (since a successive president can't overturn them unilaterally).\n\nLaws also require many more elected officials to sign on in order for them to pass \u2014 meaning the president isn't the sole political owner of any piece of legislation.\n\nBut laws are, by design, very hard to pass. The minority party on Capitol Hill can stop almost anything it organizes against. And interest groups can target lawmakers to influence their votes. It can take years of planning and lobbying to find the right moment to pass a piece of legislation. The president's actions, while temporary and limited, can be enacted with the stroke of a pen.", "date": "2017-01-23 00:00:00", "title": "Executive orders: What Trump can and can't do"}

The Obama administration offered formal protection to a group under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, geared toward undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children who grew up here and were pursuing education or jobs.\n\nTrump has said that such individuals are not his priority, that he wants to focus on removing \"bad dudes.\" Nevertheless, his sweeping executive order would seemingly allow for anyone to be detained for removal proceedings, even if they have only been suspected of committing a crime, including misdemeanors, or of being a threat.\n\n\"I think it covers just about every illegal alien in the country,\" said Hans von Spakovsky, a legal expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, which has been strongly influential on Trump's policy . \"It's also very clear that the No. 1 priority is people who have been charged and convicted with criminal offenses, and that's the kind of violent criminals who should be out of the country.\"\n\nStill, there's nothing in the current order that makes that clear. It places a violent criminal at the same level as a parent of US citizen children who works and contributes to their community, said Washington University law professor Stephen Legomsky.\n\n\"That strikes me as crazy,\" said Legomsky, who has served as a consultant to Obama, former President Bill Clinton and the George H.W. Bush administration.\n\nResources strained\n\nLegomsky and other experts believe the order places tremendous authority on individual ICE agents and divisions.\n\nThe union that represents ICE agents endorsed Trump during the campaign, offering harsh criticism of Obama's enforcement priorities. Under the past administration, officers were \"unable to arrest or are forced to release many of the most dangerous (criminals) back into U.S. communities due to unscrupulous political agendas and corrupt leaders,\" National ICE Council President Chris Crane said in a statement about the endorsement.\n\nThe new enforcement priorities, and the additional 10,000 immigration officers prescribed by the orders, are presumably designed to give ICE what it wants -- more authority.\n\nBut a former acting ICE director under Obama says that the new enforcement priorities risk overwhelming an already stressed system and makes it more difficult for individual officers.\n\n\"The language here, the fact that it says 'in the judgment of an immigration officer,' that doesn't suggest there's going to be supervisory review, it strongly suggests this is going to be the judgment of officers in the field and they'll have broad discretion about when and where to arrest someone and bring proceedings,\" said John Sandweg, now at a crisis management firm.\n\nSandweg said ICE data shows that only a few hundred thousand individuals can be removed per year, and that immigration judges and detention facilities are already overwhelmed by cases. He said that was why the Obama administration set limited priorities and specified types of criminals to target.\n\n\"I think the idea of saying there's a limited number of people can be deported in a given year, let's make sure that they're the most violent and most dangerous, that makes sense,\" he said, \"and this seems to be a reversal of that policy and I think endangers public safety as a result.\"\n\nWhile Trump's orders call for an increase in detention facilities and judges to be assigned to those facilities, it will be up to Congress to determine how much resources go to implementing these measures.\n\nLegal concerns\n\nCritics of the order are also concerned about the legal implications of not just targeting convicted criminals, but including anyone even suspected of crimes.\n\nJUST WATCHED Paul Ryan defends $14 billion border wall Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Paul Ryan defends $14 billion border wall 02:07\n\nHeidi Altman, director of policy at the pro-immigrant National Immigrant Justice Center, said the order would allow \"immigration officials to target undocumented people on the basis of their whims in that moment.\"\n\nShe argues that's problematic because it contradicts principles of the criminal justice system, including the presumption of innocence.\n\n\"An ICE officer is now making the determination to detain and deport someone that no one has adjudicated for veracity,\" Altman said. \"Innocent people get arrested in the United States a lot. ... Especially among communities of color, there are always going to be instances of racial profiling, and minorities face more aggressive policing than white communities -- that's true as well for immigrant communities. This (order) renders presumption of innocence completely meaningless.\"\n\nLegomsky and Cornell law professor Stephen Yale-Loehr said the enforcement provisions likely couldn't be challenged in court simply for how they are written, as undocumented immigrants are eligible to be detained and deported under the law.\n\nBut if the implementation of the law results in racial profiling, for example, critics could have grounds to challenge.\n\n\"I think most of the concerns are policy concerns rather than legal concerns, but if more racial profiling materially increases as a result of this, then yes there could be serious equal protection and even Fourth Amendment -- unreasonable search and seizure -- type of concerns,\" Legomsky said. \"That is speculative though, that really depends on how these orders are implemented.\"\n\nUltimately, von Spakovsky says that activists who fear the persecution of contributing members of society for being undocumented are ignoring the fact that illegal immigration is against the law.\n\n\"I see nothing wrong with deporting individuals who are in the country illegally, and I say that as a son of immigrants,\" he said. \"But my parents followed the rules to come into the country and I, like a lot of Americans, resent people who think they can break the rules and stay in the country and get ahead of people who follow the rules that we set up.\"", "date": "2017-01-28 00:00:00", "title": "Trump's executive orders dramatically expand power of immigration officers"}

Advocates have praised the SEC's pay-to-play rule for policing corruption, and have called on the agency to go further by mandating that corporations disclose all political giving publicly to their investors.\n\n\"The pay to play regulations are a useful safeguard against corruption and improper conflicts of interest,\" Adam Smith, a spokesman for the advocacy group Every Voice, said in a statement. \"With so many changes in campaign finance law in the past few years, it would make sense for the SEC to look into whether it needs to update these rules.\"\n\nUnlike FEC regulations, however, the responsibility to follow the SEC rule rests with the donors, not the campaigns, forcing each company to police their own employees to avoid being penalized.\n\nWhile the rule seems simple enough, there are big compliance questions, especially when considering the many new fundraising vessels that can now support politicians.\n\nSupreme Court\n\nIn the wake of federal and Supreme Court cases -- most notably 2010's Citizens United decision that allowed unlimited corporate and union spending on campaign speech -- today's White House hopefuls enjoy a variety of novel fundraising options that extend beyond their own official campaigns.\n\nInstead of being limited to giving directly to the candidates, donors can aid their chosen contenders indirectly through a patchwork of networks, including political action committees, \"527\" organizations, nonprofit advocacy groups and super-PACs that have the freedom to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections.\n\nIn the 2012 elections, super-PACs spent more than $600 million on political action, according to campaign finance records. The groups are legally barred from coordinating directly with campaigns, but they are often led by former advisers of the candidates they promote and undoubtedly provide support for their campaigns.\n\nBecause of the sheer number of sitting governors who may run for president in the next election cycle, super-PACs could play an even more outsized role in 2016 than 2012 by serving as a convenient way for Wall Street donors to support candidates they otherwise are not allowed to because of the SEC rule.\n\nStrengthen 'outside groups'\n\n\"It could strengthen the hands of the outside groups if this becomes a viable vehicle for Wall Street to participate in the elections,\" said Ken Gross, a former associate general counsel at the Federal Election Commission who advises campaigns on campaign finance law.\n\nSome potential 2016 contenders are already working with organizations that can raise funds before their official campaigns begin.\n\nChristie is the \"honorary chairman\" of \"Leadership Matters for America,\" a political action committee that is \"not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.\" Last year, a PAC affiliated with Jindal called \"Stand up to Washington\" was launched to help support congressional candidates alongside a Jindal-backed nonprofit called \"America Next.\" Walker in January announced the formation of a group, \"Our American Revival,\" that can promote issues and raise unlimited funds.\n\nShould they decide to formally launch presidential bids, groups like these -- as well as unaffiliated super-PACs -- will no doubt be part of their arsenal. It's possible these groups can act as a workaround to the rule, though that's uncertain and potentially risky.\n\nNo clarity from SEC\n\nThe SEC hasn't offered much clarity.\n\n\"A contribution to a political party, PAC or other committee or organization would not trigger a two-year time out,\" reads an SEC explainer published online in 2012, \"unless it is a means to do indirectly what the rule prohibits if done directly (for example, the contribution is earmarked or known to be provided for the benefit of a particular political official).\"\n\nAn SEC spokesperson declined to comment on whether donating groups tied to a governor would count as a violation.\n\nThe question, then, is whether a donation to one of these groups amounts to a contribution toward the sitting governor's electoral efforts in the eyes of the SEC. For many institutions that invest a massive financial stake in their state contracts, the consequences of violating the rule is not worth the risk of finding out after the fact.\n\nGiven the murkiness of the rule's enforcement, some firms are cautious.\n\nThe Blackstone Group, a private equity firm that helps manage the New Jersey state pension fund, has a blanket prohibition against donating to state politicians there.\n\n\"We require that all contributions be cleared and prohibit any to PACs that fund, are controlled by, or primarily benefit state and local candidates or office holders,\" Blackstone spokeswoman Christine Anderson told CNN.\n\nMitrani, the attorney and campaign finance expert, said such restraint is wise.\n\n\"A lot of companies live and breathe based on these government management services. There's so much money involved,\" he said. \"The consequence of losing this business for even a three-figure contribution is not worth the risk for a lot of companies.\"", "date": "2015-02-16 00:00:00", "title": "2016ers could face a bumpy road to Wall Street cash"}

Monday.\n\nIn a speech at times defensive and accusatory, Obama sought to use his favored weapon -- oratory -- to beat back his international challengers as well as conservatives in the U.S. who've branded him a weak leader presiding over a legacy of declining power abroad. He also took the unusual step of harnessing the global stage to rebuke the views of Republican presidential candidates on immigration and religious pluralism, perhaps mindful that this was his penultimate speech to the world body and the last before the race to replace him overwhelms the national dialogue.\n\nObama slammed \"the building of walls to keep out immigrants\" and \"demonizing\" of those of different religions, an oblique reference to some of the incidents that have cropped up on the 2016 presidential campaign trail. He didn't mention Republican candidates Donald Trump or Ben Carson by name, but he seemed to be referencing their campaigns in his remarks.\n\nHe also took direct aim at Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, saying their actions had flouted international rules and brought their countries back in time.\n\nPutin, for his part, put the onus on the U.S. for much of the chaos in the Middle East. In a U.N. address that came within 90 minutes of Obama leaving the stage, Putin blamed the U.S. and its allies for creating a power vacuum in the Middle East and North Africa, including in Libya, and of waging a campaign against Russia using economic sanctions and NATO expansion.\n\nJUST WATCHED Obama: We want a strong Russia that will work with us Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Obama: We want a strong Russia that will work with us 02:12\n\nPutin proposed a global alliance to rebuild the Syrian state and to wage war against ISIS. He also mocked the U.S. failure to deploy moderate opposition fighters in Syria to fight the terror organization, also know as the Islamic State.\n\n\"First they are armed and trained, and then they defect to the so-called Islamic State,\" Putin said.\n\nSpeaking generally about Putin's remarks, a senior U.S. administration official pointed to Obama's own remarks earlier in the day.\n\n\"The best response is what the President said about the need to work collectively through -- and not in contravention of --today's institutions, including the UN,\" the official said. \"The President's remarks laid out in pretty stark terms how our approach differs from what we've seen from Moscow.\"\n\nObama is under fire at home as well as from world leaders such as Putin, however, for the slow progress in the fight against ISIS. He also has failed to dislodge Russian fighters entrenched in Eastern Ukraine through the very measures Putin lambasted.\n\nObama's address was in part an effort to shore up international support for U.S. appraoches to these and other global crises. In particular, he advocated for his efforts to utilize diplomacy to end the crises that have cost lives and displaced millions.\n\n\"We, the nations of the world, cannot return to the old ways of conflict and coercion. We cannot look backwards,\" he said. \"We live in an integrated world, one in which we all have a stake in each other's success. We cannot turn back those forces of integration.\"\n\nDiplomatic wins -- including the Iran nuclear deal and a thaw in U.S.-Cuba ties -- have given Obama a boost. But a year after he announced his plan for airstrikes to combat ISIS terrorists, the President has faced pressure to explain the next steps in the unraveling situation in Syria.\n\nCalling Assad a tyrant, Obama criticized calls from other world leaders, namely Putin, to keep him in power.\n\n\"We're told that such retrenchment is required to beat back disorder -- that it's the only way to stamp out terrorism and prevent foreign meddling,\" Obama said. \"In accordance with this logic, we should support tyrants like Bashar al-Assad who drops barrel bombs to massacre innocent children because the alternative is surely worse.\"\n\nObama made another call for a \"managed transition\" away from Assad's government as a way to end the country's bloody civil war.\n\n\"When a dictator slaughters tens of thousands of his own people, that is not just a matter of one nation's internal affairs,\" he said. \"It breeds human suffering on an order of magnitude that affects us all.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED President Putin addresses terrorism at the U.N. Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH President Putin addresses terrorism at the U.N. 02:41\n\nAnd Obama similarly appealed for adherence to international rules while addressing Ukraine, insisting the world has a responsibility to counter Putin's aggression in the eastern part of the country.\n\n\"We cannot stand by when the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a nation is flagrantly violated,\" Obama stated in his speech. \"If that happens without consequence in Ukraine, it could happen to any nation gathered here today.\"\n\nSyria, along with the crisis in Ukraine, will provide the agenda for Obama's most anticipated meeting of his three-day U.N. visit: Monday evening talks with Putin, the first time the pair have engaged in substantive face-to-face discussion since Russia annexed part of Ukraine in 2014.\n\nObama's aides say the situation in Ukraine is at the top of the agenda, though the Kremlin indicated last week the situation there would only arise if there's time.\n\n\"There will be time,\" asserted White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest last week.\n\nAside from Ukraine, the White House says Obama will seek to gain clarity on the motivations behind Russia's recent military build-up in Syria, which U.S. officials have said is unclear.\n\nObama weighed for weeks whether to meet with Putin, who is attending the U.N. General Assembly for the first time in years. Ultimately, he determined \"it would be irresponsible to not have a face-to-face encounter and to not directly address with President Putin our positions and concerns on these two issues,\" according to Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes.\n\nJUST WATCHED The Iran Deal and Next Commander in Chief Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The Iran Deal and Next Commander in Chief 02:35\n\nThat same commitment to diplomacy also underscored Obama's defense of his Iran deal, which he said Monday was the best way to prevent Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. He said blustery rhetoric from the country's leaders wouldn't help its citizens.\n\n\"The Iranian people have a proud history, and are filled with extraordinary potential,\" he said. \"But chanting 'Death to America' does not create jobs, or make Iran more secure.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Obama will meet with Cuban President Raul Castro to discuss their two countries' renewed diplomatic ties. With relations formally reinstated, the pair want to begin developing economic plans, including an agreement to allow commercial flights to travel between the U.S. and Cuba.\n\n\"I'm confident that our Congress will inevitably lift an embargo that should not be in place anymore,\" Obama said Monday, renewing his call on lawmakers to take the final step in renewing economic ties between the two countries. It was one of the few lines that earned him applause from the assembly during his address.\n\nThe President will end his U.N. stay convening a summit meant to solidify support for the campaign against ISIS, which continues to control large swaths of Iraq and Syria. Last year, Obama came to the U.N. having just announced a strategy to \"degrade and destroy\" the terrorists.\n\nThis time around, officials say Obama is looking to focus on the various elements that lead young people to the group, which has attracted foreign fighters from the Middle East and Europe.\n\n\"The counter-ISIL campaign is going to be measured in years. But what we do have is a significant coalition of countries that are seized with this threat and that are enhancing their capabilities, and that are joining with us in this effort,\" Rhodes said, noting that Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi would join the session.", "date": "2015-09-27 00:00:00", "title": "Obama hits Putin, Republicans in U.N. speech"}

In fact, he warned Iran was more dangerous than ever Thursday, comparing the country to an \"unmuzzled\" tiger.\n\nBut there were also the first signs of a new strategy from Netanyahu to begin to repair relations with the White House ruptured by the long tug of war over the Iran nuclear deal that Obama's foes in Congress, enthusiastically backed by the Israeli leader, have failed to derail.\n\nThe strategy seemed to include holding out an olive branch to Obama and Capitol Hill Democrats by expressing a pragmatic willingness to live with the accord -- for now -- and identifying places of agreement on enforcement, which will be in both nations' interests over the deal's duration.\n\nIf Netanyahu's speech does end up easing some of the hard feelings between the U.S. and Israeli governments, however, there is no sign that any breakthroughs are likely soon on another issue that has divided Obama and Netanyahu -- the elusive search for an Israeli-Palestinian peace.\n\nViolence simmering in West Bank\n\nIn fact, the situation appears to be deteriorating, amid tensions on the sacred Temple Mount in Jerusalem, simmering violence in the West Bank and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' declaration at the United Nations on Wednesday that he would no longer honor the Oslo Accords, the 1993 deal with Israel that was supposed to lead to a permanent peace and a Palestinian state.\n\nAbbas' dramatic statement, however, didn't get the attention he might have hoped for on the international stage amidst the intense focus on Iran, not to mention the chaos in Syria and the Russian attempt to shore up ally President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIt was another sign that while the Palestinian issue was once a cause celebre and at the center of U.S. foreign policy and U.N. gatherings, it has now slipped well down a crowded list of American and international priorities.\n\nIndeed, Netanyahu felt no compulsion to pay any more than scant attention to the issue, while Obama skipped it entirely. The topic, on which the two leaders have starkly divergent approaches, has been a source of friction longer than the Iran deal has been, and the Israeli leader and his White House outreach only benefits from it being consigned to the back burner.\n\nIn his comments on Iran on Thursday, for the first time that close Middle East watchers could remember, Netanyahu uttered a sentence that was not uniformly critical of the Iran nuclear pact.\n\nJUST WATCHED Netanyahu: Iran deal makes war more likely Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Netanyahu: Iran deal makes war more likely 02:30\n\n\"This deal does place several constraints on Iran's nuclear program, and rightly so,\" Netanyahu admitted, focusing his dire warnings that the \"militant Islamic terror regime\" would be \"weeks away\" from amassing an entire arsenal of nuclear bombs only on the period after the deal's restrictions sunset in 10 or 15 years -- rather than repeating his claim that the deal itself would facilitate Iran getting a bomb in the near future.\n\nNetanyahu also called on the United Nations to keep Iran's feet to the fire and fully implement the deal he decried, offering at least the prospect of some common ground that Israel could share with the administration, as the latter also wants to see the world body remain resolute on the issue.\n\n\"Make sure that the inspectors actually inspect. Make sure that the snapback sanctions actually snap back. And make sure that Iran's violations aren't swept under the Persian rug,\" Netanyahu said. \"Of one thing, I can assure you: Israel will be watching closely.\"\n\nHe also had plenty of harsh words for the agreement: \"This deal doesn't make peace more likely. By fueling Iran's aggression with billions of dollars in sanctions relief, it makes war more likely,\" Netanyahu said, before angrily accusing the United Nations of greeting Tehran's threats to destroy Israel with silence and pausing for a chilling 45 seconds in his own speech -- glaring out at the chamber at the General Assembly.\n\nBut he also hinted at conciliation with the United States, and Netanyahu went out of his way to detail all the places where he and Obama agree.\n\nShared effort to stop Iranian proxies\n\nHe said they both wanted to keep arms away from \"Iran's terror proxies\" and to stop Tehran from destabilizing the Middle East, and he thanked Obama for helping to bolster Israeli security and its military edge.\n\nHe even reached out to Democrats, who blocked Republican attempts to kill the Iran deal and who remain furious that Netanyahu used an address to Congress earlier this year to openly criticize the President during the premier's re-election bid.\n\n\"Israel is grateful that this sentiment is widely shared by the American people and its representatives in Congress, by both those who supported the deal and by those who opposed it,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nWhile the headlines will be grabbed by Netanyahu's invective against Iran, it could turn out that the more subtle parts of his speech could be the most significant ahead of planned talks at the White House between Obama and Netanyahu in November.\n\nFormer U.S. Middle East peace negotiator Aaron David Miller told CNN that the passage of the speech about the constraints on Iran was \"curious\" and a new development.\n\n\"I think that reflects a measure of acquiescence -- not to Iran, he made it very clear that was not going to be the case -- but in essence to the agreement itself,\" he said.\n\n\"In many respects, this was an effort I think to move on, and to move on in partnership with President Obama,\" Miller continued. \"We will see if that is going to be possible.\"\n\nAnother former U.S. official, David Makovsky, who worked on the administration's unsuccessful effort to broker a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians in Obama's second term, also agreed that Netanyahu was reaching out to the President.\n\n\"I think that he extended an olive branch to President Obama and, for the first time, I heard him talk about both sides of the aisle,\" he said. \"I think it was a way of Netanyahu pivoting to say ... 'I am not an ostrich putting my head in the sand, but we want to work with the U.S. on implementation.' \"\n\nNetanyahu's speech came four days after Obama spoke in the U.N. chamber and defended the Iran deal as vindication for his strategy of pursuing hard-nosed diplomacy even with America's enemies.\n\nA missing peace deal\n\nBut there was one big omission from Obama's remarks, and that was any mention of his frustrated efforts to forge a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nGiven that it was at the United Nations in 2010 that Obama predicted an agreement could be reached on a Palestinian state within a year, his swerve was especially striking -- appearing to reflect frustration with Abbas and Netanyahu and signal that a new U.S. Middle East peace bid is unlikely during his final year in office.\n\nAbbas' vow, meanwhile, to ignore the Oslo Accords threatens to further deepen antagonism between the Palestinians and Israel.\n\nBut it remains unclear whether Abbas' move was a symbolic measure born of desperation -- and a desire to placate domestic critics of his leadership -- or will be acted upon by cutting coordination with Israel over security and other key arenas.\n\n\"It was really, at the end of the day, a very convoluted statement that does not amount to going all the way to abrogating Oslo,\" said Ghaith al-Omari, a former Palestinian Authority official now with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nThe worsening security situation in Jerusalem and on the West Bank has led to some warnings of a new Intifada, or uprising, similar those that raged in the Palestinian territories between 1987 to 1993 and 2000 to 2005.\n\nWhile some analysts believe tensions could ease in the coming weeks, al-Omari said it was impossible to say whether a crisis would be sparked that could spin out of control.\n\n\"Things are very, very volatile and anything could trigger it -- but by the same token, things could continue to be stable for a time,\" he said. \"We will not know what the trigger is until it happens.\"\n\nIf that trigger is pulled, Obama's efforts to remain aloof will likely prove futile. The administration may have to resume its frustrating role as middleman between Israel and the Palestinians, in a new test for the bruised relations with Israel that Netanyahu tried to at least start repairing on Thursday.", "date": "2015-10-01 00:00:00", "title": "Netanyahu offers olive branch of sorts to Obama on Iran"}

Hide Caption 15 of 15\n\nObama, by his own admission, has now become little more than a grim scorekeeper after mass gun massacres -- a role that on Thursday night he bitterly complained has become routine. He seems destined to turn off the lights at the White House in 16 months without substantial change on gun legislation. In office, the guns issue has been much more nettlesome than it appeared during the 2008 presidential campaign, when Obama said it should be possible to get illegal guns off the streets and prevent them from falling into the hands of the mentally ill.\n\n\"What we have to do is get beyond the politics of this issue and figure out what, in fact, is working,\" Obama said at a presidential primary debate in Philadelphia.\n\nSeven years on, Obama is still struggling to get past those politics -- but some gun-rights advocates believe he has tried his best.\n\n\"The general idea that the president hasn't done enough -- I just don't see that at all -- he was physically sick yesterday,\" said Ladd Everitt, communications director for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.\n\n\"He can't run Congress, he can't cast congressional votes.\"\n\nThough the White House push to overhaul gun legislation failed in 2013, Obama did order 23 executive actions designed to reduce violence with firearms, though he admitted congressional action would be much more meaningful.\n\nThe White House says it has made progress on all the measures, including those requiring federal agencies to share information on the background check system, to trace guns recovered in criminal investigations and to review standards for gun locks and safes.\n\nBut those measures are small ball in a nation swamped by hundreds of millions of guns and where the politics of the issue are shaped by the political muscle of the National Rifle Association.\n\nThe White House has failed to find traction on a middle ground that would allow meaningful reform to thrive while protecting the constitutional right to bear arms -- a compromise that would enjoy broad public support and still represent a practical way of regulating the firearms industry.\n\nAnd Obama seems to know it, allowing a note of self recrimination to creep into his voice on Thursday night.\n\n\"This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America. We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.\"\n\nIn a sense, Obama initially made his own political choice not to pursue gun reform -- at the moment when his political influence was at its apex, when Democrats controlled both the House and the Senate after he took office in 2009.\n\nWith a financial crisis raging and with other priorities, including health care reform, sucking up his political capital, there was no room for firearms reform.\n\nThe consequence of that choice became clear in 2013, when even a watered-down bill on background checks fell victim to a Senate filibuster by four votes -- even with shock still fresh from the gunning down of 6-year-old schoolkids in their classes in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\nEighty-five to 90% of Americans tell pollsters they favor tightening background checks to stop criminals or mentally ill people from getting weapons. Despite those numbers, there is little political momentum for change.\n\nThe chances of meaningful gun control reform are slim to none until the political mix changes in Washington -- and that could take years, since Republicans who rely on a base of voters resistant to such measures control the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nRepublican presidential candidates reacted to Thursday's shooting by uniformly resisting new gun control measures. Sen. Marco Rubio, for instance, said: \"There is just no evidence that these gun laws would prevent these shootings.\"\n\nStill, some gun-control advocates say Obama could do more than talk.\n\n\"We believe that on a few very specific fronts they can do more to crack down on bad-apple gun dealers, the very small percentage of gun dealers who sell almost every crime gun in the U.S.,\" said Dan Gross, president of the Brady campaign.\n\n\"The ATF has the power to crack down on them and pull their licenses if they are responsible for business practices that wind up causing gun crime and gun violence.\"\n\nPhotos: The 2016 candidates stances on gun control Photos: The 2016 candidates stances on gun control Hide Caption 1 of 9 Photos: The 2016 candidates stances on gun control Hide Caption 2 of 9 Photos: The 2016 candidates stances on gun control Hide Caption 3 of 9 Photos: The 2016 candidates stances on gun control Hide Caption 4 of 9 Photos: The 2016 candidates stances on gun control Hide Caption 5 of 9 Photos: The 2016 candidates stances on gun control Hide Caption 6 of 9 Photos: The 2016 candidates stances on gun control Hide Caption 7 of 9 Photos: The 2016 candidates stances on gun control Hide Caption 8 of 9 Photos: The 2016 candidates stances on gun control Hide Caption 9 of 9\n\nThe White House could also lead a national conversation on the public health and safety risks associated with gun ownership, said Gross. After all, the administration does have a campaign on healthy eating, so why not guns?\n\n\"In our opinion, they haven't done all that they can do to really lead that conversation that could result in safer homes and saving a lot of lives,\" Gross said.\n\nLooking outside Washington could also work.\n\nIncreasingly, gun-reform advocates are turning away from the impasse at the federal level to the states -- eight of which have now introduced expanded criminal background checks on private gun sales.\n\nNevada has scheduled a ballot initiative in November 2016 which would require background checks and close loopholes on online sales and at gun shows. Maine is also expected to follow suit.\n\nSuch developments hint at the reality that political change is often the work of generations rather than years -- and can span a number of presidencies.

Among Democrats, the figures were almost exactly reversed.\n\nWhile such data explain Republican caution, it may offer an opportunity for Democrats, and one -- Hillary Clinton -- has noticed.\n\n\"I think that what we need is a national movement,\" Clinton said Thursday.\n\n\"We're going to go at this from the top down, namely go back to the Congress, go back to try and put together a sensible, bipartisan position that was supported before in the Senate to get to universal background checks.\n\n\"But we're also going to go from the bottom up. I'm going to make this a voting issue, because what the NRA does in their single-minded, absolutist theology about the Second Amendment being sacrosanct.\"\n\nGun-control advocates are also taking heart from other sweeping political transformations -- including the stunning shift of opinion on same-sex marriage -- which started in the states and left federal politicians racing to keep up.\n\n\"I think, I very much believe now, that on the gun issue we are going to have our Confederate flag or our gay-marriage moment, when there is a cultural break,\" Everitt said.\n\nBut for all the optimism, the NRA has a 30-year head start in perfecting how to frame the gun argument -- in which every modest gun-regulation effort is spun as an attempt by the federal government to snatch away the guns of law-abiding Americans.\n\n\"The politics has to change,\" Obama said, still fuming, in the aftermath of the Oregon shooting when he met reporters on Friday afternoon.\n\n\"People who are troubled by this have to be as intense and as organized and as adamant about this issue as folks on the other side.\"", "date": "2015-10-02 00:00:00", "title": "Obama's change vow hits reality on guns"}

Nice!\" Trump wrote.\n\nNorth Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen!\n\nChina has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!\n\nBut, if his tweets are any guide, analysts say that Trump has backed himself into a corner on North Korea.\n\nThey say Trump needs to reach for a new playbook if he really wants to stop Kim from adding to his arsenal a rocket powerful enough to reach any part of the US.\n\nIt boils down to these four options.\n\n1. Pulling strings with China\n\nSince winning the election, Trump has suggested at least twice that China -- North Korea's economic benefactor and only real ally -- isn't pulling its weight when it comes to reining in Kim Jong Un's regime.\n\nBut analysts say Beijing has no magic wand and is both unwilling and increasingly unable to influence its unruly neighbor.\n\nJUST WATCHED How China feels about North Korea's nuclear ambitions Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How China feels about North Korea's nuclear ambitions 02:14\n\nTong Zhao, an associate at Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, says that engagement between top level North Korean and Chinese officials has been suspended for quite a while.\n\n\"China is frustrated by its inability to push North Korea,\" said Zhao.\n\nTrump could try and force China to cooperate by undermining its interests elsewhere -- launching a trade war or confronting Beijing over Taiwan or the South China Sea but it would be a high-stakes move, which Zhao says would trigger a \"huge negative response.\"\n\n\"From a US-China perspective, it would be a huge waste of (political) capital and energy going after them on North Korea when the US could approach North Korea directly,\" says John Delury, associate professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in Seoul.\n\nWhen asked about Trump's tweet, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs insisted Tuesday China played an important and positive role in resolving the issue.\n\nThe provocative but state-run Global Times newspaper was more critical, saying Trump was \"just pandering to irresponsible attitudes.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED North Korea: The biggest issue for the next US president? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH North Korea: The biggest issue for the next US president? 00:38\n\n2. Tightening sanctions\n\nTrump could push China to beef up and implement existing sanctions more harshly but there's no evidence that sanctions have any impact on North Korea's decision making, says Jeffrey Lewis, director of the US-based East Asia Nonproliferation Program.\n\n\"It allows the US and our allies to look busy while the North develops an ICBM,\" he said, referring to the acronym for intercontinental ballistic missile.\n\nZhao says that tougher sanctions may risk more brinkmanship -- Kim is a man who can't be bought off.\n\n\"I don't see how North Korea will soften its position. They see a nuclear deterrent as absolutely crucial to ensure the country's survival. Only once they have it, will they devote resources to the economy.\"\n\n3. Launching military action\n\nIt's still a matter of debate how big a risk North Korea poses militarily and whether it could really put a nuclear warhead on a missile.\n\nIt conducted two nuclear tests in 2016, one in January, and another in September, it's most powerful ever. It's also tested a string of missiles, both land and sea launched.\n\nSo far, North Korea hasn't developed a delivery system capable of reaching beyond Asia but the fact North Korea remains the only country on Earth to test a nuclear weapon in the 21st century means that any military effort to take out Kim's regime is unimaginably high risk.\n\nNorth Korea's closest neighbors are the most vulnerable targets to nuclear or conventional weapons, of which Pyongyang has an ample arsenal. South Korea would have to be prepared for potential devastation if Kim were to strike.\n\n\"It's not a viable option. We are way past pre-emption,\" said Delury. There are few other aggressive actions available, he added. North Korea has no diplomats the US could expel.\n\n\"North Korea is hard to punish because it has so little to lose. This is why it's different to Iran -- where there was an economy integrated with Europe, a middle class that we could use as leverage.\"\n\n4. Sitting down with Kim\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump said he would be happy to host Kim for a visit, saying in June \"what the hell is wrong with speaking?\"\n\nThe comment appeared off the cuff and hasn't been repeated but Zhao and Delury both said that engagement was the only option if Trump wanted to make any head way with North Korea.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump says he would talk to North Korea's Kim Jong Un Replay More Videos ...

He has the right instincts,\" Delury said.\n\nA US president meeting with the leader of a rogue regime known for its massive human rights abuses would be a hard sell domestically, Delury stressed, but wild card Trump might be capable of pulling it off.\n\n\"You could imagine Trump in Pyongyang in a way you couldn't imagine Hillary Clinton,\" he said.\n\nZhao said that North Korea had refrained from making any provocations since October and appeared to be willing to engage with a Trump administration.\n\nTrump could potentially be the \"American president who prevented North Korea from obtaining the ability to strike the US with a nuclear weapon,\" Zhao added.\n\n\"You only get a big breakthrough when two leaders actually talk to each other.\"", "date": "2017-01-03 00:00:00", "title": "4 ways Donald Trump could deal with North Korea"}

The President put a bug in the ear of business executives, warning in a meeting they would face huge tariffs if they send manufacturing abroad. And he huddled with union leaders, promising a torrent of new jobs and factories.\n\nTuesday, the President will meet with the heads of the Big Three automakers : Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler.\n\n\"We are going to put a lot of people back to work. We are going to use common sense and we are going to do it the way it is supposed to be done,\" Trump said Monday.\n\nTrump's moves also reversed the bipartisan orthodoxy advanced by successive presidents that has viewed US interests as best served by spreading American-style trade across the globe through large multilateral trade agreements. From now on, Trump said, the US will seek bilateral deals that will most of all benefit Americans and be quickly terminated if US partners cheat.\n\nHis action quickly scrambled political lines in Washington, as he set himself against large sections of his own Republican Party and consolidated his position on economic territory long occupied by Democrats.\n\nTrump's vow to kill or renegotiate multilateral trade deals was an important factor in his narrow November election victories in industrialized states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which upended the political map based on the votes of many workers -- including Democrats -- who feel left behind by economic globalization.\n\nMonday's moves offered a first glimpse of the \"America First\" principle that the President said in his inaugural address on Friday would now undergird every decision on foreign, economic and trade policy.\n\nTrump's spokesman Sean Spicer said that Trump was deeply preoccupied with the lives of people who helped him win last November.\n\n\"I think that's where his head's at, is trying to look at those people that come to his rallies, that have come to his events, that he's met with in person that are struggling and say 'Mr. Trump, I'm working as hard as I can. I'm working two jobs, I'm doing everything by the rules, and I keep getting screwed.'\"\n\n\"That's what he's fighting for,\" Spicer said.\n\nDemocrats on notice\n\nTrump's success in transcending party lines -- at least for now -- was evident in an approving statement about his TPP move from the AFL-CIO, the powerhouse union that endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for President last year.\n\n\"Today's announcement that the US is withdrawing from TPP and seeking a reopening of NAFTA is an important first step toward a trade policy that works for working people,\" said AFL-CIO President Rich Trumka.\n\nIn a political sense, Trump's busy first weekday in office also put Democrats on the back foot. He used the power and visibility of the presidency to impress his midwestern base of union and blue-collar voters -- even as the demoralized party of ex-President Barack Obama struggles to settle on a message to win them back.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer had only a terse response to Trump's move to pull out of the TPP, a deal the Obama administration spent years trying to negotiate but was unable to get ratified by Congress.\n\n\"TPP was dead long before President Trump took office. We await real action on trade,\" said Schumer in a statement.\n\nFast start\n\nThe White House understands it needs a fast start since Trump entered office with the lowest approval ratings for a newly inaugurated president in modern times.\n\nIts answer was a swift display of executive power to generate a sense of momentum for his new administration as forthcoming attempts to create jobs through legislation, such as an infrastructure package that many Republicans oppose, could take months.\n\n\"I am very encouraged by the degree to which they are going to use executive orders to ... dramatically change things very rapidly,\" said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump supporter, at a Heritage Foundation lecture.\n\nTime and again Monday, reporters were herded into the Oval Office and the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing to see Trump in action, signing executive orders or laying down the law to union leaders or business leaders from blue chip companies like Dell, Ford, Johnson & Johnson and Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe image of the new President as a man of action was a sign that after a rocky first weekend, which included massive protests nationwide, his off-key speech at the CIA and a new media feud centering around the crowd size at Friday's inauguration, that the new White House was finding its feet and able to drive a coordinated political message.\n\nDangerous strategy\n\nBut it's one thing to maintain a solid public relations strategy. It's another to pull off the ambitious reorganizing of US trade and commerce that Trump is proposing. So Monday represented only a small first step.\n\nThe President's belief that trade pacts are responsible for the flight of many US jobs overseas represents a political risk, since higher tariffs and trade disputes that may result could make foreign goods more expensive for consumers or slow economic growth.\n\nDisrupting NAFTA may also be dangerous: Trade between the US, Canada and Mexico hit $1.1 trillion in 2016, according to a Wharton Business School report. Supporters of the pact say it supports millions of jobs in the United States that could be at risk if it falters.\n\nTrump's decision to reopen NAFTA therefore represents another significant gamble. For all his claims to being one of the world's great deal makers, the leaders of Canada and Mexico will be under intense political pressure to seal a better deal for their own people in new NAFTA negotiations -- and are unlikely to simply roll over and allow Trump to win all the spoils.\n\nMexico's President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto put Trump on notice Monday for tough negotiations, saying \"the Mexican president wants \"bilateral relationship with US to translate into more trade and jobs.\"\n\nWhile Democrats risked being outmaneuvered by Trump on the trade issue -- which played a powerful role in shaping the party's presidential primary, there remain plenty of other areas of contention that suggest the President's honeymoon with unions could be short-lived.\n\nThe President's labor secretary nominee, Andrew Puzder, for instance opposes calls for a rise in the minimum wage -- an issue that glues Democrats to trade union voters. His administration's business-first mantra could involve efforts to weaken labor protections. And if as expected, Trump chooses a conservative Supreme Court justice, he could rebalance the court in a way that could be damaging to union rights.\n\nTrump critics point out that photo-ops and episodes like his claim to have saved jobs at air conditioner firm Carrier during his presidential transition, represent a minuscule step toward creating millions of jobs. And Democrats also Monday accused Trump of hypocrisy for lecturing US corporate bosses on the need to keep manufacturing on US soil.\n\n\"I'd remind the President of the two simple rules he laid out in his inaugural address -- \"Buy American and Hire American\" -- two rules that his current businesses do not follow,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor.\n\n\"Trump shirts and ties are made in China. Trump furniture is made in Turkey. While he's importuning on others to \"make it in America,\" he should start by demanding it of his own business.\"\n\nTPP fallout\n\nThere are also geopolitical implications from Trump's decision to pull out of the TPP that could haunt the administration in future. The US withdrawal will certainly benefit an emboldened China and the new administration already appears on collision course with the rising Asian power.\n\nUS allies like Singapore meanwhile have repeatedly warned US credibility in Asia would be seriously damaged if Washington pulled out of the TPP.\n\nThe case against Trump's action was spelled out by Republican Sen. John McCain, who is emerging as a fierce critic of the new administration's foreign policy.\n\n\"This decision will forfeit the opportunity to promote American exports, reduce trade barriers, open new markets, and protect American invention and innovation,\" McCain said in a statement.\n\n\"It will create an opening for China to rewrite the economic rules of the road at the expense of American workers. And it will send a troubling signal of American disengagement in the Asia-Pacific region at a time we can least afford it.\"", "date": "2017-01-24 00:00:00", "title": "Trump gets to work for his blue-collar base"}

In recent days, top congressional Republicans who are most intimately involved in health care policy have urged moderation: Fearing the consequences of a rapid repeal, they have begun to speak of \"repairing\" the law and even preserving aspects of it that are working.\n\nThat shift in tone has irked other Republicans who are eager to take a swift vote to roll back as much of Obamacare as possible.

In an interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly that aired before the Super Bowl Sunday, Trump referred to the process of overhauling the health care system as \"very complicated\" and wouldn't commit to a firm timeline on when an Obamacare alternative would be rolled out.\n\n\"I would like to say by the end of the year at least the rudiments, but we should have something within the year and the following year,\" Trump said\n\nFor the most conservative members of the House, that timeline might be unacceptable.\n\nJordan, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, along with the group's chairman, Rep. Mark Meadows, released a statement last week calling on House leadership to bring for a vote the Obamacare repeal bill that the House passed during the last Congress. (That measure was vetoed by President Barack Obama.)\n\nThe 2015 bill would have repealed the mandates that individuals have health coverage and that companies with 50 or more employees provide employees affordable insurance. It also would have stripped away Obamacare's federal subsidies by 2018, eliminated funding for Medicaid expansion and canceled a multitude of taxes. It gave lawmakers two years to come up with a replacement plan.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan and other top Republicans are currently crafting a similar budget reconciliation bill that would unravel big chunks of the law. But that process has become complicated by pressure to include Obamacare replacement measures in that legislation.\n\nRyan said at a news conference last week that he now hopes to move Obamacare legislation by the end of March.\n\nMeadows told CNN that the party needs to move much faster.\n\n\"I don't know that there's any new revelations that are going to come up by waiting 60 to 90 more days,\" Meadows said. \"We're making the whole idea of repeal and replacement far more complex and laborious than it needs to be and I think it's time that we just make some decisions and move forward with (the repeal bill).\"\n\nOn considering anything less than what was voted on in 2015, Meadows quipped: \"You don't get any credit with any of your constituents if you do that.\"\n\nIt's not clear how widespread the calls to vote on the 2015 Obamacare repeal bill could become.\n\nBut when members of the House Freedom Caucus gather for their weekly dinner in Washington early this week, they plan to discuss the topic and try to garner broader support, according to a source.\n\nMeadows and Jordan said they support voting on a replacement bill at the same time as the repeal legislation, and are exploring potential legislation that they could rally around.\n\nLast week, members of the Freedom Caucus met with Sen. Rand Paul to discuss the Kentucky Republican's Obamacare legislation and a potential cross-chamber partnership. Paul has been adamant that an Obamacare alternative must be ready before the GOP votes to repeal the law -- a priority echoed by many fellow Republicans.\n\nReassuring the public that the GOP won't allow millions to suddenly lose coverage will become an increasingly urgent task, as Republican lawmakers start to receive blowback from constituents for dismantling the Affordable Care Act at town halls across the country.\n\nDoug Heye, who served as top aide to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, scoffed at the complaints coming from some Republicans that the party isn't voting to repeal Obamacare quickly enough.\n\nHeye, a CNN political commentator, witnessed first-hand the party's months-long effort in 2014 to craft an Obamacare replacement bill -- an exercise that didn't go anywhere.\n\n\"I can tell you chapter and verse about 2014 and all the meetings that I went to on replacement where we never produced draft legislation,\" Heye said. \"We could do the repeal vote -- that was easy. Then we tried to craft the replacement legislation, which not having the Senate and not having the White House -- it was still very much of a political act. And now it's more than that.\"", "date": "2017-02-06 00:00:00", "title": "Republicans begin to grumble: Why haven't we repealed Obamacare yet?"}

The meeting came amid Palestinian efforts to head off an embassy move, writing world leaders and increasing media outreach. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met Jordanian King Abdullah II in Amman on Sunday to coordinate moves against the possible relocation of the embassy.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to his inauguration, Trump's advisers had floated the possibility of initially having the US ambassador to Israel work and live in the US consulate in Jerusalem, while the American Embassy remains in Tel Aviv. Diplomatic sources said such a plan could be a compromise -- that allows Trump to move on fulfilling his pledge on Jerusalem -- which Israel and the Palestinians both claim as their capital -- without starting his term with a firestorm a formal relocation of the embassy from Tel Aviv would almost certainly bring.\n\nTrump has named New York lawyer David Friedman as his ambassador to Israel, pending Senate confirmation.\n\nAmong the options being considered are for Friedman to begin work Jerusalem, either from a hotel suite or a designated office in the US consulate.\n\nFriedman, who already maintains a home in Jerusalem, has long been a proponent of moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem and, upon being named, said he looked forward to working \"from the US Embassy in Israel's eternal capital, Jerusalem.\"\n\nThe 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act calls on the US to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocate the embassy there. But the law allows for the move to be waived if the President deems it harmful to US national security interests. Since it passed, every US president -- Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- has signed the waiver every six months, even though Bush and Clinton had promised to move the embassy during their presidential campaigns. Earlier this month, Obama renewed a presidential waiver delaying the move for another six months, citing \"national security interests.\" The waiver expires June 1.\n\nIsraeli sources have suggested the May 24 Israeli holiday of \"Jerusalem Day\" as a possible date for a more official move toward relocation. That national holiday commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem and the establishment of Israeli control over the Old City following the June 1967 Six Day War and typically is marked by ceremonies and memorial services.\n\nDiplomats suggested that once the administration is in office for a few months, the threat of more chaos in the Middle East and the need not to alienate US Arab allies may cause a newly-minted President Trump to sing a different tune.\n\nCNN's Athena Jones, Oren Liebermann and Allie Malloy contributed to this report.", "date": "2017-01-22 00:00:00", "title": "US committed to Israel embassy move but expected to act cautiously"}

And he warned in a recent speech that \"any statement or position that disrupts or changes the status of Jerusalem is a red line which we will not accept.\"\n\nAbbas has followed up with written pleas to the leaders of Russia, China, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Arab League and others asking them to stop Trump.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry issued his own warning, telling CBS last week that if the US moves its embassy to Jerusalem, \"you'd have an explosion -- an absolute explosion in the region, not just in the West Bank and perhaps even in Israeli itself, but throughout the region.\"\n\nState Department officials, speaking anonymously so they can express themselves freely, said they fear the move will lead to security problems for US diplomatic missions and troops throughout the Middle East, create friction in US relationships with countries across the region, and cause even deeper rifts between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nThe European diplomat said the US's long-standing role as an honest broker is also at stake.\n\n\"If the US changes its policy so dramatically, then it's very easy for others to dismiss their role and leadership in the peace process by saying, well, now the Americans are so closely aligned with Israel, it's hard for us to take them as brokers,\" the diplomat told CNN.\n\nThat diplomat's country, like the US under previous administrations, wants to wait to move its embassy to Jerusalem, which Palestinians also claim as their capital, until final peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\n\"We're always said we're fine with moving our embassy to Jerusalem when there's an agreement in place,\" the diplomat said.\n\nThis diplomat echoed others from Europe in saying that the Trump transition team has been very clear in talks that its priority is helping Israel \"in whatever terms Israel would like to be helped and if they prefer the embassy in Jerusalem, why not?\"\n\nUS allies point out that if the embassy move takes place, it will matter where exactly it goes. West Jerusalem would be less problematic than if it's placed in East Jerusalem, which Palestinians could see as an annexation by Israel.\n\n\"If it's moved into East Jerusalem, the Palestinians would certainly view it as a provocative move,\" said another European diplomat.\n\nThe Trump team has offered no specifics on when or where the embassy would move, but Trump has said he'd like it to happen soon.\n\nIn a speech to the pro-Israel lobby group American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March, Trump said he wanted to \"move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.\" In a subsequent TV interview, he said the move would happen \"fairly quickly.\"\n\nThe Trump team didn't respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nUS officials told CNN one option would be to simply switch signs on the embassy in Tel Aviv and the smaller US consulate in Jerusalem -- but the embassy is so much larger, that would require some sort of immediate expansion of the consulate to accommodate the additional staff.\n\nThe US already owns part of a property in Western Jerusalem that could serve as a home to a future embassy there.\n\nThe Israeli Ambassador to the US, Ron Dermer, has said an embassy move would be \"a strong message against the delegitimization of Israel and of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital.\" Dermer, who has support on Capitol Hill, said that a move \"would be a great step forward to peace.\"\n\nThe 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act calls on the US to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocate the embassy there. But the law allows for the move to be waived if the President deems it harmful to US national security interests.\n\nSince it passed, every US president -- Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- has signed the waiver every six months, even though Bush and Clinton had promised to move the embassy during their presidential campaigns.\n\nEarlier this month, Obama renewed a presidential waiver delaying the move for another six months, citing \"national security interests.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether the incoming administration or Congress could overturn that waiver before it expires on June 1. To pressure Trump to make good on his promise, a trio of Republican senators have introduced a bill that would strike language allowing presidents to use the waiver -- and would halve the budget for embassy security worldwide until a move takes place.\n\n\"Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish state of Israel, and that's where America's embassy belongs,\" said one of the sponsors, Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio. \"It's time for Congress and the president-elect to eliminate the loophole that has allowed presidents in both parties to ignore U.S. law and delay our embassy's rightful relocation to Jerusalem for over two decades.\"\n\nWith the six-month extension signed by Obama expiring on June 1, Israeli sources have suggested the May 24 Israeli holiday Jerusalem Day as a possible date for relocating the embassy. That national holiday commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem and the establishment of Israeli control over the Old City following the June 1967 Six Day War and typically is marked by ceremonies and memorial services.\n\nBut the extension could give the incoming administration time to rethink the consequences of its decision and find a face-saving way to back out. Diplomats suggested once the administration is in office for a few months, the realities of chaos in the Middle East and the need not to alienate US Arab allies may cause a newly minted President Trump to sing a different tune.\n\nLast month, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman played down the crucial nature of immediately relocating the embassy.\n\n\"We've seen this promise (from US presidential candidates) in every election,\" Lieberman noted during remarks at the Saban Forum. \"It's very important but we have other issues.\"", "date": "2017-01-10 00:00:00", "title": "Trump pushes US Embassy move in Israel amid outcry"}

ISIL is an acronym for ISIS.\n\n\"The result of this kind of action will inevitably, simply be to inflame the civil war in Syria,\" Carter said.\n\nA senior U.S. administration official told CNN's Elise Labott that a Russian airstrike near the Syrian city of Homs \"has no strategic purpose\" in terms of combating ISIS, which \"shows they are not there to go after ISIL.\"\n\nSyrian state-run news agency SANA reported that Russian warplanes had targeted \"ISIS dens\" in al-Rastan, Talbiseh and Zafaraniya in Homs province; Al-Tilol al-Hmer, in Qunaitra province; Aydoun, a village on the outskirts of the town of Salamiya; Deer Foul, between Hama and Homs; and the outskirts of Salmiya.\n\nAccording to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 28 people were killed in the strikes, including women and children.

Businessman Donald Trump announced June 16 at his Trump Tower in New York City that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination. This ends more than two decades of flirting with the idea of running for the White House.\"So, ladies and gentlemen, I am officially running for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again,\" Trump told the crowd at his announcement.

And yet for so many Americans, the promise of America seems more and more distant.\" Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has made a name for himself in the Senate, solidifying his brand as a conservative firebrand willing to take on the GOP's establishment. He announced he was seeking the Republican presidential nomination in a speech on March 23.\"These are all of our stories,\" Cruz told the audience at Liberty University in Virginia. \"These are who we are as Americans. And yet for so many Americans, the promise of America seems more and more distant.\" Hide Caption 3 of 6 Photos: Who's running for president? Ohio Gov.

And I hope you'll join me on this journey.\" Hillary Clinton launched her presidential bid on April 12 through a video message on social media. The former first lady, senator and secretary of state is considered the front-runner among possible Democratic candidates.\"Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion -- so you can do more than just get by -- you can get ahead. And stay ahead,\" she said in her announcement video. \"Because when families are strong, America is strong. So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, because it's your time.

Sen. Bernie Sanders , an independent from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, announced his run in an email to supporters on April 30. He has said the United States needs a \"political revolution\" of working-class Americans to take back control of the government from billionaires.\"This great nation and its government belong to all of the people and not to a handful of billionaires, their super PACs and their lobbyists,\" Sanders said at a rally in Vermont on May 26. Hide Caption 6 of 6\n\nIt just got much more difficult.\n\nCruz's big Wisconsin win raises the possibility that Trump romps in the Northeast, wins California and still comes up just short, throwing the nominating battle into a contested convention.\n\nCruz tried again to consolidate the anti-Trump movement , touting in a Milwaukee speech the $2 million he said his campaign has raised Tuesday alone.\n\nJUST WATCHED What is a brokered convention?

MUST WATCH What is a brokered convention? 01:35\n\nHe also made a play to unify Republicans, dropping his usual attacks on Trump and instead taking aim at Clinton in his victory speech.\n\n\"Either before Cleveland or at the convention in Cleveland, together, we will win a majority of the delegates, and together, we will beat Hillary Clinton in November,\" Cruz said.\n\nThe Texas senator's supporters -- and Republicans allied with anybody whose name isn't Trump -- crowed that Wisconsin marked a turning point in the race, especially as Trump watches delegates slip away in states he's already won because his campaign hasn't mastered the contest's procedural intricacies.\n\n\"GOP voters in Wisconsin rejected Donald Trump just like the entire Republican base will do in Cleveland this summer,\" Katie Packer, a Republican strategist who helms the anti-Trump Our Principles PAC, said in a statement.\n\nTrump has to regroup\n\nThe good news for Trump: The next stop is New York, where the billionaire calls home and is up in the polls.\n\nBut Wisconsin shows he has some brand maintenance to do.\n\nComing off perhaps the worst week of his campaign , Trump -- who'd claimed as recently as Tuesday morning that he thought he'd win the Badger State -- fell far short. He split the vote with Cruz of Republicans who said they wanted a candidate who could bring change. He was blown away by those worried about electability.\n\nOne especially concerning figure for Trump: He was blown out by 22 percentage points by Cruz in suburban areas and 13 points in urban areas, compared to just 3 points in rural areas. That's bad news as the race moves to the densely-populated east coast.\n\nThat all explains why Trump lost, and lays out the challenges he confronts: Now he has to face down adversity and appear, in his own words, \"more presidential.\"\n\nThe only silver lining might have been that there was no significant gender gap -- an indication Trump's two stumbles and subsequent reversals over abortion didn't depress his support from women.\n\nBern-ing hot headed into New York\n\nSanders got an affirmation of his momentum, with six wins in the last seven contests. He will need that momentum to stay strong if he's going to truly knock Clinton off her heels\n\nTo keep his streak going, Sanders will need to beat her out east -- in New York on April 19, and then in some combination of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware the following week.\n\nIn those states, Sanders will be competing without his typical advantages. In Wisconsin, loyal Democrats split 50-50, but Sanders won independents 71-29. The east coast races, though, are closed contests -- which means only registered Democrats can participate, limiting his ability to bring new, young voters into the process.\n\nWhat Wisconsin gives Sanders is the ability to keep raising big dollars, and keep his supporters energized in states where organizational work will be especially important. He has outraised Clinton, $109 million to $75 million, in the last three months.\n\nBefore heading east, Sanders made a stop in Laramie, Wyoming, where he'll try to make it seven out of eight states when that state holds its caucuses Saturday.\n\n\"I was told that about 5,000 people participated in the last Wyoming caucus. It looks like all of them are here tonight,\" he joked as he started his speech, leaning hard into one buzzword: \"Momentum.\"\n\n\"I know a little bit about New York because I spent the first 18 years of my life in Brooklyn, New York. Now please keep this a secret -- do not tell Secretary Clinton; she's getting a little nervous and I don't want her to get more nervous -- but I believe we've got an excellent chance to win New York and a lot of delegates in that state,\" he said.\n\nClinton waiting for Sanders\n\nWisconsin was the kind of state -- overwhelmingly white, and independents are allowed into party primaries -- that Sanders had to win. And he did: He crushed Clinton among voters 18-29 by his standard margin of 82% to 18%, and won those 30-44, two to one. He won white voters, 59% to 41%. That number was flipped among non-whites, but in Wisconsin, 83% of the Democratic electorate was white.\n\nStates like New York that are far more diverse have proven to be Clinton country. And the former secretary of state is wasting no time welcoming Sanders back to the state where he grew up.\n\nJUST WATCHED Bernie Sanders feeling media heat after new interview Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Bernie Sanders feeling media heat after new interview 01:23\n\nReaders of The New York Daily News will see a front-page story Wednesday denouncing \"Bernie's Sandy Hook shame.\" Sanders Tuesday faced blistering criticism over his interview with the newspaper's editorial board , where he seemed unable to go beyond top-level talking points on his core policy issues, like breaking up the big banks.\n\nIn an unusual move, Clinton's campaign sent out the entire Sanders transcript as part of a fundraising email.\n\n\"We've said for a long time that this primary is about who's really going to be able to get things done. And from reading this interview, you get the impression Senator Sanders hasn't thought very much about that. In fact, even on his signature issue of breaking up the banks, he's unable to answer basic questions about how he'd go about doing it, and even seems uncertain whether a president does or doesn't already have that authority under existing law,\" Clinton aide Christina Reynolds wrote.\n\nThe GOP's battleground woes\n\nIf Gov. Scott Walker's experience of three statewide wins in four years shows anything, it's that Republicans can win in Wisconsin.\n\nBut Cruz and Trump may have an uphill climb in November.\n\nExit polls showed that only 62% of Republicans said they'd vote for Trump in the fall. Another 10% said if he's the nominee, they'd support Clinton, while 17% said they'd back a third-party candidate and 8% said they wouldn't vote at all.\n\nFor Cruz, the numbers were similar: 66% said they'd vote for him, while 6% said they'd back Clinton. But 18% said they'd pick a third-party candidate, and another 6% would stay home.\n\nIt's an ominous sign for the fall. Wisconsin isn't a must-win state for a Republican in the general election -- but it is winnable, and, like Illinois, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, it's home to a vulnerable senator (Ron Johnson) who the GOP hopes will be part of a governing majority next year.\n\nThose exit poll numbers are, in theory, good for John Kasich , because they bolster his argument that he's the only electable Republican left standing.\n\nBut the Ohio governor has his own problems. The same factors that hurt Trump -- Wisconsin is highly educated and less angry -- should have helped Kasich. Yet he finished a distant third, once again failing to lend any credibility to his case for staying in the race.", "date": "2016-04-06 00:00:00", "title": "Wisconsin primary: 5 takeaways"}

Jerry Brown said, \"I have directed the California Department of Public Health to advise the state's counties that they must begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in California as soon as the Ninth Circuit confirms the stay is lifted.\"\n\nBrown, a Democrat, said he interpreted the high court opinion as making Prop 8 unconstitutional and unenforceable. The state's Attorney General Kamala Harris agreed and urged the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco to issue its mandate \"immediately.\" But by law, that cannot normally be done so for at least 25 days, to allow for possible new legal challenges.\n\nAs soon as the court lifts the stay, \"the wedding bells will ring\" said Harris on Wednesday. \"This is a huge day for California.\"\n\nBut there is legal uncertainty whether the high court's ruling could be enforced statewide, or limited to only a few jurisdictions.\n\nIt was act two in a closely watched pair of high court appeals over state and federal laws and the limits of recognizing the ability of gay and lesbian couples to wed. The outcome of the rulings gives same-sex couples much to be encouraged about.\n\nCalifornia voters approved Proposition 8 in 2008 with 52% of the vote shortly after the state Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriages are legal. The measure put gay and lesbian marriages on hold in the state, but a federal appeals court later rule Proposition 8 was unconstitutional.\n\nTwo of the original plaintiffs -- Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo, a Burbank, California, couple who want to marry but could not because of Proposition 8 -- contended the state was discriminating against them because of their sexuality.\n\n\"This is about our freedom and our liberty,\" Katami told CNN. \"We are not trying to topple marriage.

They were cheered when emerging from the court building.\n\nTheir views were echoed by fellow same-sex marriage supporters, who rallied outside the court with the hope that the justices will eventually issue a broad ruling to strike down bans nationwide.\n\nIn dissent, Justice Anthony Kennedy said the court's majority ignored the initiative process that led to the passage of Proposition 8.\n\n\"What the court fails to grasp or accept is the basic premise of the initiative process. And it is this. The essence of democracy is that the right to make law rests in the people and flows to the government, not the other way around. Freedom resides first in the people without need of a grant from government,\" he said. \"The California initiative process embodies these principles and has done so for over a century. ... In California and the 26 other states that permit initiatives and popular referendums, the people have exercised their own inherent sovereign right to govern themselves. The court today frustrates that choice.\"\n\nKennedy was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nSome Prop 8 supporters argued the high court ruling means the voter referendum remains in place and enforceable.\n\n\"Proposition 8 being the law of the state of California makes it clear that marriage is only one man and one woman. The four plaintiffs that brought this lawsuit may have a right to get marriage licenses issued to them. But this was not a class-action lawsuit. It does not apply statewide, \" said Austin Nimocks, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom. \"Because there's no appellate decision holding it unconstitutional under the California Constitution, which is what controls this interpretation, Proposition 8 remains the law of that state.\n\nThe case is Hollingsworth v.

But increasingly, top lawmakers are tempering their rhetoric as they confront the monumental challenge of dismantling a law that covers 20 million people.\n\nAt a House subcommittee hearing Thursday morning to debate health care draft legislation, Republican Rep. Leonard Lance stressed that the party wants to \"repair the ACA.\"\n\n\"We want to repair the ACA and I have never favored its repeal without a replacement,\" Lance said. \"I think it needs to be repaired and we are trying to focus on repairing it and that is why we're conducting this hearing along with other hearings.\"\n\nThose comments echoed those of Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch and others from earlier in the week. Hatch, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee that has significant jurisdiction over health care, told CNN that his party should \"try and repair the law.\"\n\n\"I'm for repealing it and starting over, but you can certainly look at the good things that may be part of the law. There are some good things that we would put in any bill,\" he said.\n\nThat notable shift in rhetoric among his colleagues had House Speaker Paul Ryan on the defensive on Thursday.\n\nAt a news conference, Ryan insisted that for all the talk about repairing President Barack Obama's legacy health care law, the GOP still fully intends to \"repeal and replace\" Obamacare.\n\n\"There's just a miscommunication or misinterpretation of what we're trying to say. Our job is to repair the American health care system and rescue it from the collapse that it's in,\" Ryan said. \"And the best way to repair our health care system is to repeal and replace Obamacare. It's not an either-or.\"\n\nRyan's explanation is unlikely to appease Democrats across the political aisle, who are eager to point out the GOP's shifting messaging.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that there has been a \"vocabulary\" change among Republicans recently.\n\n\"I think that some of their vocabulary is changing on the subject. They're using words like 'rebuild' or those kinds of words,\" Pelosi told reporters. \"You'll hear less and less of 'repeal.'\"\n\nShe laughed off the explanation from Ryan that Republicans are simply referring to repairing the health care system -- not the health care law.\n\n\"The health care system is what it is,\" Pelosi said. \"They have had seven years to come up with (a plan) and so far we hear vocabulary changes and the rest.\"\n\nOther Republicans, like Sen.

I think they all mean the same thing to me,\" Portman said.\n\nThe Ohio Republican pointed to the pre-existing conditions piece of Obamacare as an example of a part of the law that even Republicans support preserving.\n\n\"You could say that's 'continuing' or that's 'fixed' or 'replaced' or whatever,\" Portman said. \"There are aspects of the Affordable Care Act that some of us have all along said are necessary.\"", "date": "2017-02-02 00:00:00", "title": "Republicans add to Obamacare confusion with 'repair' pitch"}

And they're starting to be more open about acknowledging that the Affordable Care Act may never entirely disappear.\n\nGOP Rep. Greg Walden, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said in an interview Wednesday that it is time to do away with the notion that there is a GOP Obamacare \"mega-bill\" in the works.\n\n\"There isn't,\" said Walden, whose committee has significant jurisdiction over healthcare. \"We're looking at fixing this mess a brick at a time.

MUST WATCH Trump: Obamacare is a disaster 01:34\n\nThere's no doubt that overhauling President Barack Obama's legacy accomplishment remains an urgent political priority for the GOP. Trump explicitly ran on undoing the law as a presidential candidate -- the same way that Republican officeholders across the country rallied their supporters with that promise in every election cycle since 2010.\n\nBut despite the impassioned rhetoric from years past -- and despite being armed with the powerful advantage of controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House -- Republican are increasingly eager to cast the process of dismantling Obamacare as a long-haul marathon.\n\nThis tempered rhetoric could anger some segments of the GOP base, which for years has heard Republican candidates chant \"repeal and replace Obamacare\" as a snappy political slogan.\n\nSen. Brown: Republicans are getting nervous\n\n\"I'm hearing more and more quiet conversations. They're expressing public bravado about 'repeal and replace' and they're nervous and jittery and they know what they're doing is going to hurt millions of people,\" Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown said of his GOP colleagues in an interview with CNN.\n\nThe perception of working with Democrats to make incremental changes to Obamacare, Brown added, would amount to political suicide for Republicans.\n\n\"That would make their base mad,\" he said. \"They've been singing this song for six years and their base (will say), how come you're not doing this?\"\n\nMultiple tracks\n\nIn the clearest sign that it is simply impossible to quickly and entirely repeal and replace a health care law that covers 20 million people, the party is currently moving on multiple tracks and taking a piecemeal approach to rolling back the law.\n\nIts most immediate task is to pass a bill to roll back significant portions of the Affordable Care Act through the budget reconciliation process. That legislation is being written by policy aides spanning several key congressional committees with guidance from GOP leadership, with an eye towards a late-February to March timeframe.\n\nThe writing of that repeal bill became more complicated when a broad spectrum of rank-and-file Republicans began to express concern in recent weeks that the GOP is moving too fast on repealing Obamacare. In part to ease those concerns, GOP leaders agreed to explore ways of including some replacement measures in that legislation.\n\nAnd for the first time this Congress, lawmakers have started to debate legislation to make changes to Obamacare.\n\nOn Thursday, a House subcommittee will examine a group of bills aimed at ensuring those with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage -- one of the most popular aspects of Obamacare -- as well as lowering premiums.\n\nTwo bills address insurers' requests to tighten the rules for signing up outside the standard open enrollment period and reduce the grace period consumers have to pay their premiums while still maintaining coverage. Another would allow insurers to charge older enrollees more compared to their younger consumers.\n\nIn a hearing Wednesday, members of a House Energy subcommittee considered several bills to tighten Medicaid rules, including ending benefits for lottery winners and closing a loophole that allows married couples to shelter assets in order to qualify for the program.\n\nHHS nominee Tom Price still waiting\n\nGOP lawmakers are also counting on one colleague in particular to help with some of the heavy-lifting: Rep. Tom Price.\n\nPrice, Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, is expected to be confirmed by the Senate in a matter of days following a dramatic boycott from Democrats who are unhappy with Price's vetting.\n\nAs head of the HHS, Price will have a broad mandate to carry out an Obamacare executive order that Trump signed on his first day in office. The Georgia congressman will also have a slew of other administrative tools at his disposal to dilute and weaken the law.\n\n\"Some of that will happen over there (at HHS). Some of that we will have to legislate. Some of that will be in reconciliation,\" Walden said, describing the many ways in which Republicans are tackling Obamacare.\n\nThe congressman, who met a group of centrist Republicans and Democrats on Wednesday to discuss Obamacare, acknowledged that a part of the challenge will be appeasing lawmakers across the political spectrum.\n\n\"You know there's a wide range of views on what we should or shouldn't do,\" Walden said.", "date": "2017-02-02 00:00:00", "title": "The GOP's incredible, shrinking Obamacare repeal"}

It's the latest in a string of admissions from the foundation that it didn't always abide by a 2008 ethics agreement to disclose its funding sources publicly. According to foundation officials, the income -- at least $12 million and as much as more than twice that -- was not disclosed publicly because it was considered and tallied for tax purposes as revenue, rather than donations.

Now, as Obama participates in his last Southeast Asian summit to promote the pivot and its massive trade pact, the TPP looks like it's headed to the political graveyard.\n\nObama tried to sound optimistic Wednesday about the deal's future, while also conveying to leaders in Asia the reality of the obstacles.\n\n\"I believe that we'll get it done but it's always going to be hard,\" Obama said at a news conference in Laos, suggesting the deal's path might be easier after the US election. \"Nothing is easy in the US Congress right now. Maybe there was a time when it was but I haven't seen it.\"\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump roused a populist base with his strident anti-trade message, declaring the Pacific Rim deal \"terrible\" and a \"rape\" of American workers. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, seeking to minimize the threat of primary opponent Bernie Sanders, announced that she, too, opposes the TPP. And, sensing the political risk of supporting a controversial deal both presidential nominees oppose, several lawmakers changed their positions.\n\nTrump is expected to call Wednesday for eliminating the sequester on defense spending and bolstering the US' defenses by proposing a \"major investment\" in US military spending.\n\nAs Obama tries to cajole last concessions from partner countries on his final trip to Asia, the same congressional leaders who'd nudged him along on the TPP now say it's unlikely to be ratified.\n\n\"The current agreement, the Trans-Pacific agreement, which has some serious flaws, will not be acted upon this year,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell flatly declared at a Kentucky Farm Bureau event last week.\n\nRight now, with even pro-trade stalwarts like McConnell opposed to ratification during Obama's term, advocates of the TPP admit that they don't have the votes necessary to clear the House and the Senate.\n\nThe summer has featured a rush of Republicans -- particularly those in competitive races -- bolting from the trade deal.\n\nSen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican and long-time trade supporter, wrote in August in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette op-ed : \"We should dump the TPP and return to the negotiating table to get an agreement that would create jobs and economic growth here at home.\"\n\nMissouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt told reporters he's having second thoughts about the deal . Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, once a Trump challenger, hasn't taken an official position, but he stripped mention of trade -- and his support for earlier steps greasing the wheels for TPP -- from his website, RealClearPolitics recently reported\n\nAnd Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who once negotiated pacts as the US trade representative under George W. Bush, opposes the TPP.\n\nConservative activists who waged a battle to deny Obama trade promotion authority in the first place, meanwhile, say they believe Trump awakened a party that had been ignoring its loyalists on trade.\n\n\"I think this will last. Every time an issue comes to the forefront, I've never seen the activists forget about it. Once that issue is in the quiver and activists are paying attention to it, it stays there and activists will fight it forever,\" said Tea Party Patriots co-founder Mark Meckler. \"The stain is here to stay.\"\n\nThe deal's supporters -- including the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers -- aren't giving up. But they acknowledge the uphill battle on Capitol Hill.\n\nLinda Dempsey, the National Association of Manufacturers' vice president of international economic affairs, said that, \"additional leadership is needed in Washington to forge a viable path forward.\"\n\nThe US manufacturing sector \"continues to lose foreign sales and access to new customers in some of the fastest-growing markets in the world,\" Dempsey warned about the deal falling through.\n\nObama and TPP advocates have a problem with the president's typical allies on the left, too.\n\nOnly a small group of Democrats -- mostly members of the centrist New Democrat Coalition -- backed trade promotion authority in the first place, making for the unusual coalition of Obama and congressional Republicans.\n\nSince then, those Democrats have been under pressure from labor unions that argue the TPP, which they've dubbed \"NAFTA on steroids,\" would siphon more manufacturing jobs away from the United States.\n\nSanders stoked opposition to the TPP among unions and progressives during the primaries, making it a mainstay of his stump speech and his go-to answer about what differentiated him from Obama and Clinton.\n\nThat forced Clinton -- who'd declared the TPP a \"gold standard\" trade deal in 2012 while serving as Obama's secretary of state -- to the left. Her announcement in the fall of 2015 that she opposes the deal made Obama's task of getting Democrats on board even tougher.\n\nOpponents, meanwhile, are declaring victory -- at least for now.\n\n\"It won't come up because the votes aren't there,\" Richard Trumka, the head of the AFL-CIO, a labor union that opposes TPP, said at a Christian Science Monitor Breakfast Thursday. \"The candidates running will have to declare where they stand on TPP and the chips will fall where they may.\"\n\nRepublican House Speaker Paul Ryan has maintained the deal would need substantial renegotiation -- a tough task since each of the other 11 participating nations have their own political sensitivities and Obama has less than five months remaining in office.\n\n\"They have to fix this agreement and renegotiate some pieces of it if they have any hope or chance of passing it,\" Ryan said in an early August interview with Wisconsin Public Radio. \"I don't see how they'll ever get the votes for it.\"\n\nBut McConnell made clear last week that the path to the TPP's passage isn't totally closed.\n\n\"It will still be around. It can be massaged, changed, worked on during the next administration,\" he said.\n\nEven if Congress ultimately does approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the next president will have ways of blocking its implementation -- such as procedural steps like refusing to officially notify other countries of the United States' implementation of the deal or not verifying that those countries have satisfied their TPP commitments.\n\nThe hope of trade supporters is that a President Clinton or Trump would drop their resistance to the trade deal once in office. If they did, they'd be following a path similar to Obama, who pledged as a presidential candidate to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement but governed as a trade supporter who entered new negotiations with the European Union and Asia-Pacific countries.\n\nBut trade was less of a driving issue in the 2008 race, and neither Clinton nor Trump has left much wiggle room for a post-election reversal.\n\n\"I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages -- including the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\" Clinton said in August in Warren, Michigan. \"I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as president.\"\n\nTrump -- whose strident rejection of the TPP and other trade deals is a staple of his campaign events -- denounced the pact again on conservative radio host Laura Ingraham's show Thursday.\n\n\"It's a terrible deal for the United States,\" he said. \"It's a terrible deal for our workers.\"", "date": "2016-09-06 00:00:00", "title": "Obama pushes trade in Asia, but has 2016 killed the TPP?"}

But the approach means that other forces joining the fray -- including Iran and now Russia in Syria -- may not necessarily agree with America's preferred end game.\n\nObama offered a full-throated justification of his policies -- particularly emphasizing diplomacy over the use of force -- in his own U.N. address, but he seemed on the defensive amid claims by critics that his policies have emboldened U.S. adversaries.\n\nThe most ardent challenger on Monday was Putin, who appears to be probing openings in Ukraine and Syria where he believes the U.S. president will not resist. He recently ordered a military buildup in Syria apparently in support of President Bashar al-Assad, a longtime Russian client, and went behind Washington's back to conclude an anti-ISIS intelligence alliance with Iran, Syria and Iraq just this weekend.\n\nRussia criticizes U.S. interventions\n\nPutin's message at the U.N. podium Monday was a simple one: U.S. interventions and unilateralism have backfired in the Middle East, and it is time to try something new.\n\nHis speech will do little to undercut a widespread impression in many Western capitals that his aim in Syria is not just to bolster a Moscow ally but, primarily, to thwart U.S. power and influence in the Middle East.\n\nPutin took particular aim at U.S. involvement in Iraq and Libya, which he said fostered a power vacuum filled with \"extremists and terrorists.\"\n\n\"Do you realize now what you've done?\" he asked.\n\nHe called for a ministerial conference and then a U.N. resolution to reorient strategy against ISIS -- even though many U.S. observers believe his real aim is to prioritize attacks against rebels opposed to al-Assad and to thwart U.S. aspirations in a region in which Obama has shown little appetite of becoming embroiled.\n\nPhotos: Russian President Vladimir Putin Photos: Russian President Vladimir Putin Russian President Vladimir Putin is a popular but polarizing figure who has dominated Russian politics for more than a decade.

Xi, president of a nation that Washington faults for stoking tensions in Asia with its territorial claims at sea while increasingly elbowing the United States in the Pacific, hit out at criticism of China's communist system.\n\nAnd in a thinly veiled warning against new U.S. military adventures, he warned that \"those who adopt the high-ended approach of using force will find that they are only lifting a rock to drop on their feet.\"\n\nAnd Iran, which the United States accuses of supporting terror throughout the Middle East, portrayed its deal with world powers over its nuclear capabilities as an example of U.S. capitulation and blamed \"incorrect actions of newcomers to the region and naive transregional actors\" -- a clear reference to Washington -- for the chaos in the Middle East.\n\nSensing the rising challenges to U.S. power that were all too evident at the U.N. on Monday, Obama openly faulted the perception -- fueled by Republican presidential candidates -- that he is a weak leader who has emboldened American adversaries.\n\nObama looks to defend his legacy\n\nHe seemed to be addressing the historians who will consider his legacy as much as his contemporaries on the world stage, especially when he defended his policy of cooperating with some of the very leaders he faults.\n\n\"We see in our debates about America's role in the world a notion of strength that is defined by opposition to old enemies, perceived adversaries, a rising China, or a resurgent Russia, a revolutionary Iran,\" Obama said.\n\nHe was particularly contemptuous of Putin, mocking \"state-controlled media\" notions of a revived Russia. He said Ukrainians wanted to align with Europe not Moscow and pointed out that sanctions had led to a \"fallen ruble and the emigration of more educated Russians.\"\n\n\"History is littered with the failure of false prophets and fallen empires, who believed that might always makes right, and that will continue to be the case. You can count on that,\" Obama said.\n\nBut Obama also acknowledged that he was open to a realistic approach that could see him work with Russia and Iran to fight ISIS and back a \"managed transition\" away from al-Assad.\n\nSeeing al-Assad remain in power for some time and cooperating with Iran on Syria are positions that the administration has long frowned on, and their embrace exposes Obama to criticism from those at home as well as from the adversaries that he faced on the world stage Monday.\n\nJUST WATCHED Obama: We want a strong Russia that will work with us Replay More Videos ...

He's in fact strengthened Putin's hands,\" Rubio said in an interview with NPR that aired Monday, complaining that states in the region were despairing at the lack of a U.S. strategy to beat ISIS.\n\n\"If left with a choice between Russia and nothing, they're going to choose Russia,\" Rubio said.\n\nObama has made no secret of the fact that he disdains Putin as a bully and the Russian leader appears to view his opposite number as weak. The ill regard was noticeable in the days leading up to their meeting along the U.N. sidelines, with each side arguing that the other had pushed for the meeting and declaring that the talks were focused entirely on their own priorities -- Ukraine in the case of Obama and Syria for Putin.\n\nWhile Obama arguably lost the power play by participating in the meeting -- he has shunned Putin since his annexation of Crimea in 2014 -- both sides ultimately conceded that they still need to work with each other by showing up and awkwardly shaking hands for the cameras Monday.\n\nIt seemed clear that Obama did not particularly want to be there, but Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, told CNN's \"The Lead\" on Monday that it would have been \"irresponsible\" not to meet Putin and test his intentions.\n\nIt was also an appearance that will likely play better in Moscow, where Putin wants to convince Russians he is a key actor on the global stage, than in Washington.", "date": "2015-09-28 00:00:00", "title": "Vladimir Putin steals Barack Obama's thunder on world stage"}

There are options developed to leverage those opportunities.\"\n\nOne key option needing White House approval is whether to provide ammunition for the so-called Syrian Arab Coalition -- a loosely affiliated group of fighters and militias in the region -- along with Syrian Kurds, who have had recent success in pushing back ISIS, especially from the Turkish border, which it uses to bring in foreign fighters.\n\nAnother decision to be made is exactly how the U.S. military will now train and equip moderate Syrian rebels as part of the broad Pentagon program.\n\nThe current proposal is to get White House approval to pull back from training those rebels in Turkey and Jordan as a combat force and focus instead on having them trained to help provide intelligence and communications.\n\nThe goal is to continue to stop the flow of foreign fighters and also cut off ISIS resupply lines from Syria into northern Iraq. But cutting off those lines will be difficult.\n\nCol. Patrick Ryder, spokesman for U.S. Central Command, told reporters Friday that ISIS still retains some \"freedom of movement\" in eastern and southern Syria. Those are key areas for those supply routes.\n\nTwo officials told CNN there was a brief discussion inside the Pentagon about whether there was any benefit to sending a small number of U.S. troops into northern Syria to help with these efforts, but it was quickly rejected as unnecessary because of the success of other forces there. Officials insisted the idea is not considered to be a serious option.\n\nDespite the opportunities presenting themselves in Syria and successful strikes against leadership there, whether progress can be made inside Iraq remains an open question. Ryder noted that Iraqi forces have not made any real forward progress in retaking Ramadi nearly four months after it fell and are being urged to do so by the United States.", "date": "2015-09-26 00:00:00", "title": "U.S.: Russia may be seeking proxy in case Assad falls"}

Too bad, but we will get it done anyway!\"\n\nThe United States and most other nations consider Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem as an obstacle to the hopes of a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nThe Obama administration, which mounted two failed efforts to broker Middle East peace, became increasingly angry about continued Israeli settlement expansion over its eight years in the White House. The Palestinians accuse Israel of trying to establish facts on the ground by building on land they view as part of their future state.\n\n\"Today, the United States acted with one primary objective in mind: to preserve the possibility of the two state solution, which every US administration for decades has agreed is the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians,\" Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement, adding that the US does not \"agree with every aspect\" of the resolution.\n\nHe added: \"We cannot in good conscience stand in the way of a resolution at the United Nations that makes clear that both sides must act now to preserve the possibility of peace.\"\n\n'Secretly cooked up'\n\nHours before the UN Security Council vote, the Israelis made clear their intense disappointment with the US over the resolution, which calls on Israel to \"immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.\"\n\n\"President Obama and Secretary Kerry are behind this shameful move against Israel at the UN,\" a senior Israeli official told CNN.\n\n\"The US administration secretly cooked up with the Palestinians an extreme anti-Israeli resolution behind Israel's back which would be a tailwind for terror and boycotts and effectively make the Western Wall occupied Palestinian territory,\" a senior Israeli official said.\n\nBefore the vote, a Palestinian official said, \"We have nothing to say about this. No President has troubled Palestinians in the UN more than President Obama.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported this week that Obama's advisers did not disclose a position on how the US would vote and were holding out until the vote to see how the matter developed. Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security advisor, told reporters Friday that he wasn't sure if Obama and Trump had spoken about this issue and added he was not aware of any particular conversation.\n\nRhodes said Obama made the decision this morning, adding that \"there's one president at a time.\"\n\nUS and Palestinian officials denied the Israeli accusation of colluding on the UN vote. The resolution was originally put forward by Egypt but it was withdrawn under pressure from the Israelis. Four countries, New Zealand, Venezuela, Malaysia and Senegal, brought it up again for a vote on Friday.\n\nA senior Obama administration official said, \"To be clear: from the start, this was an Egyptian resolution. The Egyptians authored it, circulated it, and submitted it for a vote on Wednesday evening before asking for a delay and subsequently removing their sponsorship.\n\n\"Contrary to some claims, the administration was not involved in formulating the resolution nor have we promoted it.\"\n\nA senior Palestinian official told CNN they were not informed how the US would handle the Security Council vote when a delegation was in town earlier this month to urge the administration to support it. The Palestinian official said they did not know how the US would vote and called the Israeli allegation \"totally untrue.\"\n\nTwo senior US officials involved in this process vehemently also denied the Israel accusation and also said that the US itself didn't really know how it was going to vote until Thursday morning. The official said Kerry himself was surprised that the Egyptians put the resolution forward so quickly. He was left scrambling to finish his speech and then left scrambling again when the Egyptians delayed the vote on Thursday.\n\n\"A veto means support of settlement activities,\" Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, said after the resolution was pulled, according to the Times. \"A veto means abandoning the two-state solution and peace efforts.\"\n\nThe UN resolution -- which calls on Israel to \"immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem\" -- was delayed by Egypt after Israeli pressure\n\nRaises tensions\n\nThe resolution exacerbated divisions between the outgoing Obama administration and incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Obama administration had been weighing whether to support the UN measure or abstain from voting, which would have been a break from the US's traditional practice of shielding Israel at the UN and other international organizations.\n\nThe Obama administration has grown increasingly frustrated by Israeli settlement construction and it has repeatedly warned it could foreclose the possibility of a two-state solution with the Palestinian people. The admission of an internal debate about the UN resolution illustrated how unhappy the administration is with the Israeli government.\n\nIsrael -- concerned by the outgoing administration's ambivalence -- reached out to Trump for support. An Israeli official told CNN that his country approached the Trump team after it felt that it had failed to persuade the Obama administration to veto the planned vote.\n\nThe official said that Israel \"implored the White House not to go ahead and told them that if they did, we would have no choice but to reach out to President-elect Trump.\"\n\nTrump subsequently put out a statement opposing the resolution.\n\n\"As the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations,\" Trump said. \"This puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.\"\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi also spoke with Trump by phone about the UN Security Council vote, according to a diplomatic source familiar with the call and an aide Trump.

That put off a potential standoff between the US and Israel and prompted what some analysts called unprecedented interference from the US President-elect.\n\nBut the Israeli official told CNN that his country also approached the Trump campaign after it felt that it had failed to persuade the Obama administration to veto the planned vote. The official said that Israel \"implored the White House not to go ahead and told them that if they did, we would have no choice but to reach out to President-elect Trump.\"\n\n\"We did reach out to the President-elect and are deeply appreciative that he weighed in, which was not a simple thing to do,\" the official said.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi called Trump and spoke with him about the UN Security Council vote, according to a diplomatic source familiar with the call and an aide Trump. The call was first reported by Reuters.\n\nPublicly, the resolution drew condemnations from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Trump, who called on the White House to veto it. Having a President-elect weigh in to influence US policy is highly unusual, analysts said.\n\n\"It's unprecedented that a President-elect would pronounce on a matter of US policy before he became president,\" said Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Wilson Center, \"let alone say publicly that the administration should not vote for the resolution.\"\n\nTrump transition spokesman Jason Miller said the transition team gave the White House a heads up before it sent the statement out Thursday morning about the Security Council vote.\n\nTrump's election has brought the fraught Israeli-Palestinian conflict to the fore in recent days, with his appointment of an ambassador designate to Israel who supports Israeli settlement construction and his call for the US Embassy to be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a highly sensitive issue designated for final peace talks since Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their capital as well.\n\nJUST WATCHED Israel amb. supports US Embassy Jerusalem move Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Israel amb. supports US Embassy Jerusalem move 03:39\n\nHis attempt to publicly pressure the White House on the vote highlights a split between his incoming government and the Obama administration, which has grown increasingly frustrated by Israeli settlement construction that it has repeatedly warned could foreclose the possibility of a two-state solution.\n\nThe Egyptians, who sponsored the resolution, told the Security Council they wanted to postpone the vote -- which had been set for 3 p.m. ET -- until after an Arab League meeting Thursday afternoon to review the text.\n\nThe postponement put off a chance for the Obama administration to make a strong statement of disapproval about Israeli settlement building, widely considered illegal under international law.\n\nWhile the US makes a point of shielding Israel at the UN and other international organizations, a senior US official said that this time, the administration was debating whether to abstain or vote yes. That marks a departure, and even the public admission of an internal debate serves to show how unhappy the administration is with the Israeli government.\n\nThe White House was not considering a veto, the US official said, but added that if the resolution is amended, US officials will need to review it before deciding how to vote.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, made his unhappiness with the resolution clear, saying in a statement that the US should issue a veto if it is brought to a vote.\n\n\"As the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations,\" Trump said. \"This puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.\"\n\nTrump's statement put the White House in a bind and \"undermines US credibility,\" said Miller of the Wilson Center. Even if the Obama administration decided to back the resolution, Miller said, it would be clear to the rest of the international community that the incoming administration wouldn't stand by it.\n\n\"It's fortunate for them the Egyptians are walking away,\" Miller said of the White House.\n\nAs recently as October, the US berated Israel for announcing plans to build a new settlement, part of a string of Israeli construction activity that could eventually bisect the West Bank, making it physically impossible to form a contiguous Palestinian state.\n\nThe US \"strongly condemned\" the news, State Department Mark Toner said at the time, adding that the plans \"would seriously undermine the prospects for a two-state solution.\"\n\nSettlements, he said, are \"cementing a one-state reality of perpetual occupation that is fundamentally inconsistent with Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama, whose relations with Netanyahu have been famously tense, is reportedly considering setting out parameters of a peace deal before he leaves office.\n\nFor now, a showdown over the resolution has been averted.\n\nA draft of the resolution calls on Israel to \"immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.\" It also declares that the establishment of Israeli settlements, \"including in East Jerusalem, has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution.\"\n\nThe draft wouldn't make the settlements illegal, as they have been declared in previous resolutions, but would reiterate that point.\n\nEgypt might have pulled back the resolution because of the opposition from Trump and Netanyahu, said Eric Trager, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and an Egypt expert.\n\nSisi has been \"trying to advance talks between Israelis and Palestinians for a year now,\" Trager said. \"Given Trump's reaction, given Netanyahu's reaction, he must have realized this resolution would not advance the peace process.\"\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry scrapped plans to deliver a speech before the vote laying out the US vision for peace in the region. Kerry spoke with Netanyahu on Thursday morning and with Egypt's foreign minister, the White House said.\n\nIsrael has been intensely lobbying the US since early Thursday morning to cast a veto, as it did in 2011, the last time a draft resolution regarding West Bank settlements was put forward.\n\nNetanyahu said, \"I hope the US won't abandon this policy; I hope it will abide by the principles set by President Obama himself in his speech in the UN in 2011: That peace will come not through UN resolutions, but only through direct negotiations between the parties.\" It was the only Security Council veto of Obama's time in office.\n\nThe Israeli mission to the UN said that the delay by the Egyptians \"is an important step, however we realize that this issue is not yet resolved. We are continuing our diplomatic efforts on all fronts to ensure that this disgraceful resolution will not pass the Security Council.\"\n\n'Unprecedented' move by Trump\n\nIsraeli officials argue that by allowing the resolution to pass, the Obama administration would have been tying Donald Trump's hands once he takes office.\n\n\"What is unprecedented is to undermine an incoming administration in this way,\" an Israeli official said.\n\nThe officials say they believe that Trump will seek to make good on his pledge to negotiate what he has called the \"ultimate deal\" between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\n\"This action at the UN would make it harder for him to do that,\" the official said.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump told CNN's Wolf Blitzer he would \"love to be neutral if it's possible\" in negotiating Middle East peace.\n\n\"It's probably not possible because there's so much hatred,\" Trump said, adding that he opposed UN intervention in the peace process.\n\nJUST WATCHED What stance will Trump take on Middle East?

So ... if the United Nations forces a deal, I would veto that deal immediately.\"\n\nShift of Israel policy\n\nThe resolution would have marked the biggest international step on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process since the 1993 Oslo Accords, which saw the beginning of direct negotiations between Israel and the PLO. It would also have marked a dramatic departure from decades of US foreign policy, which has held that peace will come only through negotiations. But the peace process has stalled in recent years. The last round of Israeli-Palestinian talks, initiated by Kerry, collapsed in April 2014, with both sides blaming each other.\n\nAt the time of the US veto in 2011, US Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said the US \"rejects in the strongest terms the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlement activity,\" but stressed that peace would not come through resolutions.\n\nThe tone in official Washington might be set to change once Trump takes office.

The reason we took this step is because for years, we've seen an acceleration in the growth of these settlements. And frankly, if these current trends continue, the two-state solution is going to be impossible. The peace that people say that they want, that we badly want for the people of Israel -- a secure Israel living side-by-side a Palestinian state -- that goal will become impossible.\"\n\nThe United States allowed a UN Security Council resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlements, defying pressure from the Israeli government, which had reached out to President-elect Donald Trump for help in pressuring the Obama administration to veto the vote.\n\nThe Security Council approved the resolution 14-0, with the US abstaining.\n\nAsked what the White House would say to Israeli officials who believe the US does not have their back, Rhodes said, \"It's just not backed up by the record. We just concluded a $38 billion tenure (memorandum of understanding) for security assistance to Israel.\"\n\nRhodes said the resolution also condemns the incitement of violence, \"which we've seen too often in Palestinian territory, which is also an impediment of peace. So, we made clear the responsibility is on both sides -- the Palestinians to stop terrorism, to stop the incitement of violence, and the Israeli government to not continue with settlements that will make peace impossible.\"\n\nReaction immediately followed the vote, with Palestinians cheering but harsh criticism coming from both Republicans and Democrats. Netanyahu's office harshly criticized the Obama administration, accusing it of \"colluding\" at the UN to force the vote while also publicly saying the Israeli leader looked forward to working with Trump.\n\nOn Thursday, CNN reported the Israeli government reached out to Trump, to help pressure the Obama administration on the vote.

The 5-4 high court majority dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, saying the private parties who brought the appeal had no legal \"standing\" or authority to press their claims.\n\nCalifornia officials have interpreted the ruling as allowing same-sex marriage to resume in the state within weeks.\n\nRoberts' ruling\n\nFrom the majority opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts (supported by Justices Antonin Scalia, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Elena Kagan):\n\n-- \"We have never before upheld the standing of a private party to defend the constitutionality of a state statute when state officials have chosen not to. We decline to do so for the first time here.\"\n\n-- \"Petitioners (Proposition 8 supporters) argue that the California Constitution and its election laws give them a 'unique,' 'special,' and 'distinct' role in the initiative process. ... True enough -- but only when it comes to the process of enacting the law. Upon submitting the proposed initiative to the attorney general, petitioners became the official 'proponents' of Proposition 8. As such, they were responsible for collecting the signatures required to qualify the measure for the ballot. After those signatures were collected, the proponents alone had the right to file the measure with election officials to put it on the ballot. Petitioners also possessed control over the arguments in favor of the initiative that would appear in California's ballot pamphlets. But once Proposition 8 was approved by the voters, the measure became 'a duly enacted constitutional amendment or statute.' Petitioners have no role -- special or otherwise -- in the enforcement of Proposition 8. They therefore have no 'personal stake' in defending its enforcement that is distinguishable from the general interest of every citizen of California.\"\n\n-- \"Petitioners here hold no office and have always participated in this litigation solely as private parties.\"\n\n-- \"Standing in federal court is a question of federal law, not state law. And no matter its reasons, the fact that a State thinks a private party should have standing to seek relief for a generalized grievance cannot override our settled law to the contrary.\"\n\nKennedy's dissent\n\nFrom the dissent by Justice Anthony Kennedy (supported by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Sonia Sotomayor):\n\n-- \"What the Court fails to grasp or accept is the basic premise of the initiative process. And it is this. The essence of democracy is that the right to make law rests in the people and flows to the government, not the other way around. Freedom resides first in the people without need of a grant from government. The California initiative process embodies these principles and has done so for over a century. ... In California and the 26 other states that permit initiatives and popular referendums, the people have exercised their own inherent sovereign right to govern themselves. The Court today frustrates that choice.\"\n\n-- \"Proponents' authority under state law is not a contrivance. It is not a fictional construct. It is the product of the California Constitution and the California Elections Code. There is no basis for this Court to set aside the California Supreme Court's determination of state law.\"\n\n-- \"The Court's opinion disrespects and disparages both the political process in California and the well-stated opinion of the California Supreme Court in this case. The California Supreme Court, not this Court, expresses concern for vigorous representation; the California Supreme Court, not this Court, recognizes the necessity to avoid conflicts of interest; the California Supreme Court, not this Court, comprehends the real interest at stake in this litigation and identifies the most proper party to defend that interest. The California Supreme Court's opinion reflects a better understanding of the dynamics and principles of Article III than does this Court's opinion.\"", "date": "2013-06-26 00:00:00", "title": "Key quotes from Supreme Court ruling on state same sex-marriage law"}

Hide Caption 10 of 10\n\nThe case examined whether the federal government can deny tax, health and pension benefits to same-sex couples in states where they can legally marry. At issue was whether DOMA violates equal protection guarantees in the Fifth Amendment's due process clause as applied to same-sex couples legally married under the laws of their states.\n\nThe key plaintiff is Edith \"Edie\" Windsor , 84, who married fellow New York resident Thea Spyer in Canada in 2007, about 40 years into their relationship. By the time Spyer died in 2009, New York courts recognized same-sex marriages performed in other countries.\n\nBut the federal government didn't recognize Windsor's same-sex marriage, and she was forced to assume an estate tax bill much larger than those that other married couples would have to pay. So, Windsor sued the federal government.\n\nA federal appeals court last year ruled in Windsor's favor, saying DOMA violated the Constitution's equal protection clause.\n\n\"Today's DOMA ruling is a historic step forward for #MarriageEquality. #LoveIsLove,\" President Barack Obama's official Twitter account posted soon after the decision was handed down.\n\nKennedy, in his opinion, used sweeping language to affirm the rights of gays and lesbians.\n\n\"For same-sex couples who wished to be married, the state (of New York) acted to give their lawful conduct a lawful status. This status is a far-reaching legal acknowledgment of the intimate relationship between two people, a relationship deemed by the state worthy of dignity in the community equal with all other marriages,\" he said. \"DOMA seeks to injure the very class New York seeks to protect.\"\n\nBut Kennedy -- a moderate-conservative who proved once again to be the \"swing,\" or deciding, vote -- made clear the ruling is limited: \"This opinion and its holding are confined to those lawful marriages.\" Thirty-five states have laws banning same-sex marriage.\n\nUnder DOMA, Social Security, pension and bankruptcy benefits, along with family medical leave protections and other federal provisions, did not apply to gay and lesbian couples legally married in states that recognize such unions.\n\nIn a thunderous dissent, read from the bench, Justice Antonin Scalia slammed the majority for its \"exalted conception of the role of this institution\" -- the Supreme Court -- \"in America.\"\n\n\"Few public controversies touch an institution so central to the lives of so many, and few inspire such attendant passion by good people on both sides,\" he said. \"Few public controversies will ever demonstrate so vividly the beauty of what our (Constitution) framers gave us, a gift the court pawns today to buy its stolen moment in the spotlight: a system of government that permits us to rule ourselves.\"\n\nScalia added, \"Some will rejoice in today's decision, and some will despair at it; that is the nature of a controversy that matters so much to so many. But the court has cheated both sides, robbing the winners of an honest victory, and the losers of the peace that comes from a fair defeat. We owed both of them better. I dissent.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito also dissented.\n\nWindsor was in New York when the ruling came down. She told reporters that she was overjoyed.\n\n\"We won everything we asked and hoped for. Wow,\" she said. \"I'm honored and humbled and overjoyed to be here today to represent not only the thousands of Americans whose lives have been adversely impacted by the Defense of Marriage Act, but those whose hopes and dreams have been constricted by the same discriminatory law.\"\n\nWindsor thanked the supporters who cheered her on throughout the case.\n\n\"Because of today's Supreme Court ruling, the federal government can no longer discriminate against the marriages of gay and lesbian Americans. Children born today will grow up in a world without DOMA, and those same children who happen to be gay will be free to love and get married as Thea and I did, but with the same federal benefits, protections and dignity as everyone else,\" Windsor said. \"If I had to survive Thea, what a glorious way to do it.

The apprenticeships would be registered with either a federal or state program that would ensure standards were met.\n\nDuring the speech, Clinton highlighted the 2014 bipartisan plan from Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, a Republican who hails from North Charleston, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, a Democrat.

Bernie Sanders, Clinton's most significant 2016 opponent so far, has been an outspoken proponent of debt-free college and has received the vocal backing of liberal groups like the Progressive Change Campaign Caucus for that position.\n\nClinton said that in order to fully addressed higher education, the country will have to \"change how we consider education.\"\n\n\"It is too expensive for so many young kids and their families to afford to go to college right now,\" she said. \"So we have got to give ways for people to get the cost down.\"\n\nIn particular, Clinton touted \"vocational and technical education\" as a way to address what each local workforce needs.\n\nThe speech was hosted by Trident Technical College, a small college in North Charleston.

It said restoration of mutually beneficial economic ties \"could further stimulate progressive and stable development of bilateral relations,\" according to a CNN translation of the Russian statement.\n\nThe White House called the one-hour chat a significant start to improving a relationship \"in need of repair.\"\n\nBoth Trump and Putin said before the call that they would like to see warmer ties between their two nations. However, relations between Trump and his team and Russia have been under scrutiny following allegations that Moscow meddled in the US election last year.\n\nSpeaking Friday at his first White House news conference , Trump indicated a willingness to work with Moscow.\n\nBut he said it was \"too early\" to discuss removing sanctions that his predecessor, President Barack Obama, imposed on Russia.\n\nJUST WATCHED Pence: US needs common purposes with Russia Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Trump to speak with key European allies 01:31\n\nIn an interview this month with The Times newspaper in London and the German publication Bild , the US President called Merkel \"by far the most important leader\" in Europe -- but was critical of the welcome she has extended to refugees.\n\n\"I think she made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all of these illegals, you know taking all of the people from wherever they come from. And nobody even knows where they come from,\" Trump said in that interview.\n\nHe also appeared to undermine the European Union, currently grappling with the prospect of Britain's exit, saying: \"You look at the European Union and it's Germany. Basically a vehicle for Germany. That's why I thought the UK was so smart in getting out.\"\n\nMerkel, who is running for a fourth term in office later this year and faces criticism from political opponents over her refugee policy, declined to comment on Trump's remarks.\n\nIn their call Saturday, Trump and Merkel discussed NATO and other topics, officials said.\n\n\"The leaders recognized that NATO must be capable of confronting 21st-century threats and that our common defense requires appropriate investment in military capabilities to ensure all Allies are contributing their fair share to our collective security,\" the White House reported.\n\nA German statement used the phrasing \"common defense investment in military capabilities and a fair contribution of all allies.\"\n\nTrump will attend the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, in July, the two statements said.\n\nHollande outspoken\n\nTrump may also have to build bridges with France, traditionally a close ally of the United States.\n\nHollande, who plans to stand down as president this spring, was outspoken at a joint news conference Friday with Merkel about the \"challenges\" the Trump administration poses for Europe in terms of trade and global diplomacy.\n\n\"We of course have to speak to Donald Trump, as he was chosen by the Americans to be their president. But we have to do it with a European point of view and promote our interests and values,\" he said in Berlin.\n\nThe French government said Hollande referred to NATO as indispensible and also told Trump the nuclear agreement with Iran needs to be respected and fully implemented. Hollande added that the nations should be vigilant with Tehran.\n\nThe French President told the new American leader that situation in Syria requires a political solution and the involvement of the United Nations, according to the French statement.\n\nAs to the crisis in eastern Ukraine, Hollande said sanctions must stay in place until the Minsk agreement is implemented.\n\nThe White House said Trump offered condolences for the loss of life in terrorist attacks in France and discussed his desire to cooperate more on counterterrorism and security.\n\n\"The leaders also lauded our combined efforts to eliminate ISIS in Iraq and Syria,\" the White House statement said. It also said Trump, as in the other calls, reiterated the US committment to NATO and the importance of allies sharing costs.", "date": "2017-01-28 00:00:00", "title": "Trump-Putin phone call discuss stabilizing ties, Kremlin says"}

The same official said the Russians have begun flying drones around the coastal city of Latakia.\n\nWith no ISIS fighters in the area, the move raises serious questions about the Russians' intentions with their military buildup, which the U.S. has questioned the purpose of and watched with wariness. The action points to a higher likelihood that the Russian plan is to prop up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad rather than fight the terror group.\n\nRead More", "date": "2015-09-24 00:00:00", "title": "Russian fighter jets enter Syria with transponders off"}

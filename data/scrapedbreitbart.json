Al Franken about meetings with \u201cforeigners\u201d while serving as a surrogate for candidate Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. Sessions replied that he had no such meetings while assisting the Trump campaign.\n\nThe Washington Post summarized the confirmation hearing encounter this way in its March 1 story:\n\nAt his Jan. 10 Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing, Sessions was asked by Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) what he would do if he learned of any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of the 2016 campaign. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any of those activities,\u201d he responded. He added: \u201cI have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.\u201d\n\nLater, after the Senate committee hearing, a member of the committee, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), asked Sessions for answers to written questions. One question was this one: \u201cSeveral of the President-elect\u2019s nominees or senior advisers have Russian ties. Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?\u201d Leahy wrote. Sessions responded with one word: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThe important thing here is that both answers were truthful: Sessions answered the questions that were asked, not questions that were not asked. Leahy asked about conversations \u201cabout the 2016 election.\u201d Sessions replied that, no, he had no such conversations with Russian officials. Senator Sessions\u2019 meeting with the Russian Ambassador in his Senate office had nothing to do with the 2016 campaign and was not unlike meetings held with the Russian Ambassador by many Democrat senators during the year.\n\nOh, and by the way, President Obama met with the Russian Ambassador in the White House 22 times during his presidency.\n\nBut truthful answers by Sen. Sessions are not good enough for Senate and House Democrats\u2013 and not good enough for a small handful of House Republicans like Colorado\u2019s Mike Coffman. Those Republican members of Congress should be ashamed, and their constituents back home should be planning their 2018 replacements.\n\nCongressman Coffman distanced himself from candidate Trump in the last days of the 2016 campaign, and his criticism of Trump\u2019s Attorney General this week fits a pattern of self-serving comments critical of Trump, his appointees, and his policies.\n\nCoffman went further than a mild rebuke of Sessions. He told a CBS news reporter in Denver that Sen. Sessions \u201cmade a grave omission\u201d in his Senate testimony by not volunteering information about his meeting in his Senate office with the Russian Ambassador.\n\nCoffman then went even further in this statement: \u201cI would encourage him to fully disclose any and all foreign contacts he had during the course of the campaign.\u201d\n\nThis latter statement basically calls Attorney General a liar by suggesting he is hiding something.\n\nThis attack by innuendo is unforgivable for a Republican congressman because it straight out of the Democrats\u2019 anti-Trump playbook aimed at promoting the Big Lie that the Russians, not the American people, elected Trump.\n\nSuch slander-by-innuendo is part of the Soros-funded \u201cDeep State\u201d strategy to undermine the legitimacy of the 2016 election results. It is quite a stretch in both fact and logic to suggest that any conversation with any Russian official, including the Russian Ambassador, during calendar year 2016 must have been part of a conspiracy to control the outcome of the election\u2013 a conspiracy for which no evidence whatsoever exists!\n\nAnd yet, despite the obvious partisan motivations behind this slanderous campaign against the President, we see some Republican members of Congress Like Coffman supporting that Soros game plan through cheap shots to generate self-serving media coverage.\n\nThe mainstream media is engaged in a witch hunt that makes the Salem witch trials of the 17th Century look like a Disneyland vacation. And yet, despite the ferocity of the campaign, they have yet to discover even one scintilla of evidence for any Trump campaign collusion with Russian hackers or Russian operatives.\n\nThey won\u2019t ever discover any evidence for one simple reason: it never happened.

Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.\u201d\n\nLewis\u2019 statement on the former president\u2019s behalf came in response to the explosive charges from President Donald Trump, who tweeted on Saturday morning that the Obama team conducted surveillance on Trump Tower during the campaign and afterward.\n\nValerie Jarrett, another close Obama aide, also tweeted the statement from former President Obama\u2019s spokesman, Lewis. Jarrett is, according to the U.K. Daily Mail, now living in the Obamas\u2019 multimillion dollar Washington, D.C. mansion. From there, the Daily Mail reports, the former president and Jarrett will be running a \u201cnerve center for their plan to mastermind the insurgency against President Trump.\u201d\n\nCheck out statement from Kevin Lewis, spokesperson to former President Obama. Enough said. pic.twitter.com/OTEQiVOHvh \u2014 Valerie Jarrett (@ValerieJarrett) March 4, 2017\n\nInterestingly, however, a number of other former Obama administration officials do not deny that such a wiretap existed. They just deny that the White House or Obama himself would have approved it or ordered it, and say that the Department of Justice would have sought it in consultation with a foreign intelligence surveillance, or FISA, court.\n\nObama\u2019s former speechwriter Jon Favreau tweeted that he would warn reporters against saying there was no wiretap.\n\nI'd be careful about reporting that Obama said there was no wiretapping. Statement just said that neither he nor the WH ordered it. \u2014 Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) March 4, 2017\n\nAnd Favreau endorsed a Twitter feed that laid out the reporting about the existence of the wiretaps, which cited reporting from Louise Mensch, formerly of Heat Street, and The Guardian that the Obama DOJ had sought a FISA court approved surveillance warrant for Trump Tower back in the summer of 2016 that was denied but received a narrower focused warrant in October.\n\nOk you definitely need to read this thread https://t.co/W7CkXjV40f \u2014 Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) March 4, 2017\n\n1/ The wiretaps that Donald Trump \"just found out\" about have been reported for weeks.

And it suggests the court had reason to permit it. https://t.co/RZrw5qmgyR \u2014 Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017\n\n10/ Donald's tweets this morning are a helpful reminder that he was under investigation, possibly for espionage. https://t.co/C00LleeOIE \u2014 Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017\n\n11/ We can now conclude that our govt has significant intelligence on Donald and his associates. We need to see it. https://t.co/QIm9WAvkzq \u2014 Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017\n\n12/ Donald can whine about being surveilled, but the reality is we citizens must now demand a special prosecutor and a select committee. \u2014 Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017\n\n13/ Interesting addendum- Donald's tweets this morning may have in fact declassified the existence of the wiretap https://t.co/pk4AdRyXLn \u2014 Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017\n\nDavid Axelrod, another former Obama adviser, tweeted that such a wiretap would receive court approval \u201cfor a reason.\u201d\n\nIf there were the wiretap @realDonaldTrump loudly alleges, such an extraordinary warrant would only have been OKed by a court for a reason. \u2014 David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) March 4, 2017\n\nIn other words, these ex-Obama officials are subtly confirming the accuracy of the reporting\u2014that the Obama administration did in fact conduct surveillance on Trump Tower in October and post-election, and that the administration originally sought a warrant back in the summer of 2016\u2014but they say the president himself and the Obama White House was not involved in the decision.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Philip Rucker, the White House bureau chief at the Washington Post, says the same thing as these former Obama officials: That the Obama spokesman\u2019s statement does not deny the existence of wiretaps on Trump Tower, only that Obama himself and the Obama White House did not approve them if they did exist.\n\nThe Obama statement does not say there was no federal wire tapping of Trump Tower. It only says Obama and White House didn\u2019t order it. \u2014 Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) March 4, 2017\n\nThe outrage from the media and the Democrats appears to be standard hatred of Trump. The president forced a set of facts into the news cycle that was already previously public but framed in a way that puts his political opponents and the establishment media on the defensive. This appears to be the calculus: either the wiretaps exist, as Trump suggests, and the president will use them to bludgeon the Obama administration and the media for impropriety and overreach; or, there were no wiretaps, which suggests the previous administration had no reason to suspect Trump colluded with a foreign government.", "date": "2017-03-04 00:00:00", "title": "Non-Denial \u2018Denial\u2019: Obama Response to Trump \u2018Wiretap\u2019 Claim Raises More Questions"}

Rachel Cryer-Bowman and Laurel Bowman-Cryer had accused the Kleins of \u201cmental rape,\u201d adding that they had suffered a \u201closs of appetite\u201d and \u201cimpaired digestion\u201d from the ordeal, which remarkably led to simultaneous \u201cweight gain.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Oregon Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian slapped a gag order on the Kleins, following the couple\u2019s interview with Family Research Council\u2019s Tony Perkins.

My cakes were my canvas,\u201d Melissa said. \u201cMy bakery wasn\u2019t just called \u2018Sweet Cakes Bakery,\u2019 it was \u2018Sweet Cakes by Melissa\u2019 because I pour my passion and heart into each cake I make. My faith is a part of that.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Kleins\u2019 situation is bleak, shifting winds in Washington may give cause for a modicum of hope.\n\nThe Obama administration sent regular signals that religious liberty would be made to bow before lifestyle choices, but the Trump administration seems to be reversing previous White House hostility toward religious faith.\n\nIn late 2016, the Obama-appointed Chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (USCCR) attacked proponents of religious liberty, suggesting that religion is simply a cover for bigotry, prejudice, and discrimination.\n\nMartin R. Castro stated that the phrases \u201creligious liberty\u201d and \u201creligious freedom\u201d are nothing more than \u201ccode words for discrimination, intolerance, racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia or any form of intolerance.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tim Schultz, the president of the 1st Amendment Partnership, the Obama administration seemed to view religion as an enemy standing in the way of their policy objectives.\n\n\u201cThey view religious freedom as a kind of inconvenient speed bump on the way to those objectives in some way,\u201d Schultz said.\n\nThis has not been the tone taken by the new administration.\n\nIn his very first executive order after assuming office, President Trump sought to \u201cease the burden\u201d of Obamacare by granting exemptions wherever possible to those unduly constrained by the law. Trump\u2019s move followed a long and contentious battle between the Obama administration and the Little Sisters of the Poor, who were being coerced into providing services to which they morally objected.\n\nThis week, dozens of conservatives and faith-based groups signed a letter urging President Trump to sign an executive order to protect the religious liberty of people and organizations that have been harassed by the federal government for expressing their beliefs on traditional marriage, the sanctity of life from birth to natural death, and other moral issues.\n\nThe Oregon Court of Appeals is expected to issue an opinion on the case of the Christian bakers sometime in the next few months.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

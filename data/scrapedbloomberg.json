The attorney general has come under fire from Democrats and some Republicans after the Justice Department acknowledged that last year, at a time he was acting as a prominent surrogate for Trump\u2019s campaign, Sessions had contacts with the Russian ambassador.\n\nTrump said he \u201cwasn\u2019t aware at all\u201d about the contacts. Asked whether Sessions should remove himself from inquiries into Russia\u2019s attempts to influence the election, Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he should do that at all.\u201d\n\nQuickTake Russia and Trump\u2019s Election\n\nThe furor over Sessions is forcing the Trump administration to defend a new front in its battle to deflect or refute allegations that his close associates had unexplained contacts with Putin\u2019s government at the same time Russia was trying to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nSessions has scheduled a press conference in Washington at 4 p.m. EDT.\n\nRepublican Voices\n\nAlong with renewed pressure from members of both parties for a full investigation of Russia\u2019s role in the election, some Republicans broke ranks with the president.\n\n\u201cJeff Sessions is a former colleague and a friend, but I think it would be best for him and for the country to recuse himself from the DOJ Russia probe,\u201d Rob Portman, of Ohio, said Thursday in a statement. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, of Utah, made similar calls.\n\nRepresentative Brian Mast, a Florida Republican in his first term, went even further.\n\n\"If he cannot commit to ensuring this process is completed with full transparency and integrity, he should resign,\" Mast said in a statement.\n\nSessions Wins Contentious Attorney General Confirmation\n\nThe chorus punctured the afterglow from Trump\u2019s address to Congress earlier this week and puts added pressure on a White House still reeling from the ouster of Trump\u2019s national security adviser last month over his contacts with Russia\u2019s ambassador. Multiple investigations are underway by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, other agencies and congressional committees into a variety of allegations related to Russia\u2019s interference with the election and possible contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials.\n\nTwo Conversations\n\nThe Justice Department confirmed Wednesday that Sessions twice had conversations last year with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak but said they were related to his role as a senator and member of the Armed Services Committee. Sessions testified during his Senate confirmation hearing Jan. 10 that he had no contacts with Russian officials.\n\nTop Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer joined House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in calling Thursday for Sessions to resign.\n\n\"Because the Department of Justice should be above reproach, for the good of the country, Attorney General Sessions should resign,\" Schumer, of New York, said at a news conference in Washington. He also said Sessions may well become a subject of an investigation. \u201cThe information reported last night shows beyond a shadow of a doubt he cannot possibly lead an investigation into Russian interference in our elections let alone come close to it.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Voices\n\nAll the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking for a criminal investigation into whether Sessions committed perjury. Comey also was coming under fire over whether he\u2019s providing Congress with enough information.\n\nAfter Comey met in private with the House Intelligence Committee for three hours Thursday, the panel\u2019s ranking Democrat, Adam Schiff, told reporters that the FBI director still was refusing to answer all of their questions, hampering the committee\u2019s nascent investigation into Russian election interference. Schiff also said Comey had withheld information from the eight lawmakers who get briefed on the most sensitive issues facing the nation.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re to get quarterly counterintelligence briefings, then we need the confidence of knowing that they are briefing us on the most significant issues,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cI think at this point we know less than a fraction of what the FBI knows.\u201d\n\nSessions continued to have support from many top Republicans. House Speaker Paul Ryan said that he saw no reason for Sessions to recuse himself at this point.\n\nRyan\u2019s Doubt\n\n\u201cIf he himself is the subject of an investigation, of course he would\u201d recuse himself, Ryan told reporters Thursday. \u201cIf not, I don\u2019t see any purpose or reason for doing that.\u201d\n\nIntelligence Chairman Richard Burr, of North Carolina, was among several Senate Republicans who also brushed aside calls for Sessions to step down or for Trump to appoint a special prosecutor.\n\n\"We\u2019re not in the business of investigating individuals, senators, that say they were doing Senate business,\u201d Burr told reporters Thursday. \u201cJeff Sessions has to decide whether his role as attorney general, whether he can participate in anything to deal with Russian involvement, potential involvement in our elections, and I trust Jeff Sessions to make that decision.\u201d\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz labeled the controversy \u201cpolitical theater\u201d on MSNBC.\n\nDemocrats say Sessions wasn\u2019t truthful when he was asked by Minnesota Senator Al Franken, during a Jan. 10 confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, what he would do if he learned that anyone tied to the Trump campaign had communicated with the Russian government during the course of the campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any of those activities,\u201d Sessions said at the hearing, adding that he had \u201cbeen called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign, and I did not have communications with the Russians.\u201d\n\nRead more: A Q&A on the saga of Trump and Russia.\n\nSessions was visited by Kislyak in his Capitol Hill office on Sept. 8, the Justice Department said in its statement, but received him in his role as a senator. He also met with the envoy among a small group of ambassadors after an event hosted by the Heritage Foundation in July at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.\n\n\u201cHis responses to me weren\u2019t accurate,\u201d Franken said Thursday on MSNBC.\n\nOfficial Capacity\n\nA Sessions spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, rejected accusations that he had misled lawmakers. \u201cLast year, the senator had over 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, including the British, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Indian, Chinese, Canadian, Australian, German and Russian ambassadors,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign -- not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Sessions was asked about the allegations by an NBC News crew. \u201cI have not met with any Russians at any time to discuss any political campaign,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nTrump said Sessions \u201cprobably did\u201d testify truthfully at his nomination hearing.\n\nThe conversations with Kislyak, first reported Wednesday by the Washington Post, have raised fresh questions about which Trump associates had contacts with Russian government officials during the presidential campaign and what was discussed.\n\nGraham Weighs In\n\nGraham, a Republican from South Carolina, weighed in with a call for Sessions to recuse himself from any investigation of Trump campaign ties to Russia during a CNN town hall Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cIf there is something there, and it goes up the chain of investigation, it is clear to me that Jeff Sessions, who is my dear friend, cannot make this decision about Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nGraham also said that if the FBI discovered any sign of potential criminal activities, a special prosecutor should be appointed to handle the matter.\n\nSessions is the second Trump administration official to face tough questions about his contact with Kislyak. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn was fired by Trump after it was revealed he had not accurately portrayed the content of his conversations with the Russian envoy to other administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe revelation that Sessions and Kislyak met came shortly after a report in the New York Times that the British and Dutch governments provided information to the U.S. government describing meetings between associates of Trump and Russian officials in European cities.\n\nCommunications Intercepted\n\nThe story also described a deliberate campaign by Obama administration political appointees to spread information about Russia\u2019s alleged attempts to interfere in the election, as well as revelations that American intelligence agencies intercepted communications discussing contacts with Trump associates.\n\nEric Schultz, a spokesman for former President Barack Obama, confirmed that Obama administration officials had sought to document intelligence related to possible Russian interference in the campaign.\n\n\u201cThis situation was serious, as is evident by President Obama\u2019s call for a review -- and as is evident by the United States response,\u201d Schultz said in an email. \u201cWhen the intelligence community does that type of comprehensive review, it is standard practice that a significant amount of information would be compiled and documented.\u201d\n\nKeep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that all funding options are currently on the table. Lawmakers and policy experts have floated ideas that include taxing corporate profits that are parked overseas and creating an infrastructure bank.\n\nThe official said that a proposal will be developed and presented to Trump, but the timing is uncertain.\n\nMost U.S. infrastructure is owned and controlled by states and municipalities, so the federal government\u2019s role is more regulatory. Trump has already issued an executive order to expedite environmental reviews and permitting for high-priority projects.\n\n\u2018Percolate Up\u2019\n\nThe National Governors Association provided to the White House a list of 428 priority projects from 49 states and territories on Feb. 8 that it had solicited from the states.

Eisenhower\u2019s construction of the interstate highway system across the U.S.\n\nLawmakers are anxious for details. Representative Peter DeFazio of Oregon, the top Democrat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said it\u2019s \u201ctime to put some flesh\u201d on Trump\u2019s proposal. \u201cWhat\u2019s missing is a real plan and the money,\u201d DeFazio said after Trump\u2019s speech on Tuesday.\n\nRepresentative Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, the Republican chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said he\u2019s met with Trump and his policy staff and told them there have to be projects in all states.\n\n\u201cWe should look at every state and say what are the projects that are going to bring the states along,\u201d Shuster said Wednesday at a meeting of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials in Washington.\n\nDemocrats including DeFazio and even some Republicans have argued that trying to rely on the private sector alone won\u2019t generate $1 trillion of investment or allow projects in all parts of the U.S. Deals involving private investment require a revenue stream such as tolls, which aren\u2019t popular or even practical in rural or thinly populated areas.\n\nSpurring Investment\n\nDemocratic congressional leaders support more spending on infrastructure but say that the proposed mechanisms to spur private investment -- such as a tax credit -- would only benefit the wealthy. Republican congressional leaders have made it clear they won\u2019t support a significant increase in spending that isn\u2019t offset by cuts so that it doesn\u2019t add to the debt or deficit.\n\nThe White House official said it\u2019s premature to speculate what the mix of private and public funding and financing might be.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said her office was exploring new ways to finance infrastructure, including through public-private partnerships, to attract private investment and remove barriers.\n\n\u201cBusiness as usual is just not an option anymore,\u201d Chao said Wednesday at the transportation officials\u2019 gathering in Washington. \u201cEveryone can agree that our country can no longer take decades to build a new bridge or a new road, a new highway or airport.\u201d", "date": "2017-03-01 00:00:00", "title": "White House Says It Will Kick Off Infrastructure Planning Thursday"}

With January\u2019s price growth exceeding the central bank\u2019s target of 2 percent for the first time in four years, the monetary authority was forced to boost foreign-currency purchases to keep the koruna from gaining beyond the imposed limit of around 27 per euro.\n\nING Groep NV estimates that the central bank bought foreign currencies worth about 19.5 billion euros ($20.6 billion) in the first two months of this year, exceeding the 16.9 billion-euro intervention volume for all of 2016. Rusnok said the bank saw the koruna as \u201coverbought.\u201d\n\nPressure on the exchange-rate cap, visible in the currency-derivatives market, peaked in the first two weeks of the year, with the 12-month euro-koruna forward strengthening to as far as 26.5 on Jan. 11.

Now, the attorney general is the focus of a controversy that could hobble a White House still struggling to find its way.\n\nAllegations that the former senator from Alabama lied to Congress by failing to disclose his meetings with the Russian ambassador have the White House on the defensive once again about the Trump campaign\u2019s contact with Russia at the same time the government in Moscow was meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe revelations give Democrats in Congress a fresh shot at attacking a Trump cabinet member they oppose and a new opening to call for a review of Trump\u2019s tax returns. The furor is also fueling demands by lawmakers, including a growing number of Republicans like Rob Portman of Ohio and Susan Collins of Maine, for an in-depth and independent investigation of Russia\u2019s attempts to influence U.S. politics.\n\nSessions occupies a unique role in Trump\u2019s world. He was the first senator to endorse him as a presidential candidate and he defended him without reservation through the darkest moments of the campaign. After Trump\u2019s unexpected victory, Sessions was given his choice of cabinet positions.\n\nNow, Democrats are calling for Sessions to resign, with Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer telling reporters Thursday that the attorney general may even become the subject of ongoing FBI investigation.\n\n\u201cIt would be of Alice in Wonderland quality if this administration were to sanction him to investigate himself,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nTrump defended Sessions on Thursday, telling reporters that he had \u201ctotal\u201d confidence in his attorney general and that he didn\u2019t think Sessions needed to recuse himself.\n\nQuickTake Q&A: No lack of twists, questions in Trump-Russia Saga\n\nSessions fills a key role for Trump, who came to Washington having never held political office.\n\nUnlike Mike Flynn, the national security adviser fired by Trump last month for failing to disclose the extent of his discussions with the same Russian ambassador to Vice President Mike Pence, Sessions was Trump\u2019s most important political ally and loyal defender during the campaign and an architect of much of his agenda.\n\nAfter failing to win confirmation for a federal judgeship in 1986, Sessions returned to Washington as a senator in 1996 and built a network of relationships in Congress. The Trump White House is also in part the Sessions White House, stocked with former Sessions aides and allies, including senior policy adviser and speechwriter Stephen Miller and Rick Dearborn, the deputy chief of staff for intergovernmental affairs.\n\nMiller, who worked for then-Senator Sessions between 2009 and 2015, is one of the president\u2019s most influential aides. He has worked to craft Trump\u2019s speeches and much of his early domestic policy, including the ban on immigration by refugees and residents of seven Muslim-majority nations.\n\nA \u2018Clearinghouse\u2019\n\nSteve Bannon, Trump\u2019s chief strategist, also staked out his position as a Sessions ally during his time as CEO and executive chairman of Breitbart News. Bannon conducted more than a dozen radio interviews with Sessions, last year calling him \"one of the intellectual, moral leaders of this populist, nationalist movement.\"\n\nIn a statement to the Washington Post in January, Bannon described Sessions as \"the clearinghouse for policy and philosophy\" in the Trump White House.\n\nAlready Thursday, the administration and some allies on Capitol Hill were signaling that a repeat of the Flynn firing isn\u2019t in the cards. While some Republicans have called on Sessions to recuse himself from any investigations into Russia, the White House and others were rallying around the attorney general, with Senator Ted Cruz dismissing Democratic attacks on Sessions as \u201cnaked politics\u201d and \u201cpolitical theater.\u201d\n\nBut Sessions\u2019s failure to disclose the contacts with the Russian ambassador under oath already had numerous Democrats, led by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Schumer, calling for his resignation. The ACLU issued a call for a perjury investigation and many Democrats reiterated demands for an independent investigation of Russia.\n\n\"The information reported last night shows beyond a shadow of a doubt he cannot possibly lead an investigation into Russian interference in our elections, let alone come close to it,\" Schumer said.\n\nSchumer said the acting deputy attorney general should pick a special prosecutor and if the administration refuses, Congress should act to empower a three-judge panel to appoint a special prosecutor.\n\nBehind Closed Doors\n\nSo far, Republican leaders have sought to focus Russia investigations to the House and Senate intelligence committees, which tend to conduct their business behind closed doors.\n\nSenate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, himself under fire for trying to knock down stories about contacts between Trump officials and Russians, defended Sessions Thursday.\n\n\"We\u2019re not in the business of investigating individuals, senators, that say they were doing Senate business,\" Burr told reporters Thursday. \"Jeff Sessions has to decide whether his role as attorney general, whether he can participate in anything to deal with Russian involvement, potential involvement in our elections and I trust Jeff Sessions to make that decision.\"\n\nOther Republicans, however, said it\u2019s time for Sessions to recuse himself outright.\n\n\"If there ever is a decision to make about prosecution then somebody other than Jeff needs to do it,\" said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Graham, who sits on the Judiciary Committee, which is also investigating Russian influence, said he wants to know if the FBI is investigating.\n\nKeep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily.\n\n\"If there is an investigation at the FBI of Trump-Russia campaign activities, I want to know about it, I\u2019m tired of reading about it in the paper. The FBI needs to let us know whether there is or there isn\u2019t,\" Graham told reporters, adding he was meeting with Director Jim Comey later Thursday. \"I\u2019m gonna look him in the eye and he\u2019s gonna tell me if there\u2019s an investigation or not, and if he doesn\u2019t tell me, then he\u2019s gonna have a hard time.\"\n\nConfirmation Battles\n\nThe furor could cause trouble for other Trump nominees; Democrats have already slow-walked the confirmations of much of his cabinet. Next week, confirmation hearings are scheduled for Sessions\u2019s deputies, who will now face even more scrutiny if Sessions has to recuse himself.\n\nTrump nominated veteran prosecutor Rod Rosenstein to become deputy attorney general, the department\u2019s No. 2 official, and Rachel L. Brand, a onetime senior counsel at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, to become associate attorney general, the No. 3 job.\n\nRepublicans can also expect Democrats to force votes on investigating Sessions and Russia more generally, and impeachment efforts aren\u2019t out of the question given Pelosi\u2019s call for \"resignation or removal\" in a Twitter posting.\n\nSessions himself has long been a law-and-order stickler.\n\nHe voted to convict President Bill Clinton of perjury and remove him from office in his impeachment trial in 1999. And he routinely criticized Eric Holder, who served as attorney general for much of former President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure \u2014 especially when it came to allegations of misleading lawmakers.\n\nWhen Holder failed to give senators considering his nomination at least seven Supreme Court briefs he signed while in private practice, a fact disclosed by the Justice Department well after Holder was confirmed, Sessions\u2019s spokesman at the time called it \"simply unacceptable.\"\n\nIt\u2019s the latest headache for an administration that had been basking in the positive reaction to Trump\u2019s first address to Congress after a rocky first month in office, and comes as Republicans and the administration face pressure to act on their signature campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare in the coming weeks.", "date": "2017-03-02 00:00:00", "title": "With Sessions Under Fire, Trump Faces Threat to His Inner Circle"}

Under the current structure, the onus falls on refiners and importers. Refiners that have relatively little or no blending infrastructure -- like Icahn\u2019s CVR Energy and Valero Energy -- must instead buy compliance credits known as \"renewable identification numbers\" to make up the shortfall.

Some of the gains were erased by the time CVR closed up 77 cents, or 3.5 percent, at $22.92 in New York.

Instead, it would alter who is required to do it -- known as the \"point of obligation.\"\n\nThe current approach puts the onus on refiners, creating a disadvantage for those -- like Icahn\u2019s CVR Energy Inc. -- with little infrastructure to blend in biofuels and generate the fungible credits that are used to show compliance. As a result, those independent refiners must buy compliance credits to make up for their shortfall. Icahn is pressing the Trump administration to make fuel blenders responsible.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence: RIN Prices Plummet Amid Calls for Ethanol Policy Shift\n\n\"I hope and believe the point of obligation will be changed shortly,\" Icahn said.\n\nThe ethanol industry is divided over the program. While most biofuel advocacy groups, including Fuels America, Poet LLC and Growth Energy oppose Icahn\u2019s plan, the Renewable Fuels Association agreed to back the structural change as long as the Trump administration also issues a waiver that would allow gasoline blends containing 15 percent ethanol to be sold year-round.\n\nThe Trump administration is not leaning in one direction or the other, according to one person familiar with the talks, but is intensely studying the issue that is both legally complex and politically complicated.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Kelly Love said there was no executive order in the works dealing with ethanol but did not directly respond to questions about the status of discussions.\n\nIcahn Lobbying Trump Sparks Civil War in U.S. Ethanol Industry\n\nGrowth Energy\u2019s members include Poet and Green Plains Inc., two of the four-biggest U.S. ethanol producers. Its membership also includes large gas station chains, including Thorntons Inc. and Kum & Go, that can benefit from the existing system. Similarly, the Renewable Fuels Association\u2019s membership roster includes an array of ethanol producers, including Valero Energy Corp., a San Antonio refiner that backs Icahn\u2019s plan.\n\nThe most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.\n\nFuels America pressed against the proposed structural change during its previously arranged Wednesday meeting with the National Economic Council at the White House. \"Our only communication with the administration has been to reinforce our opposition to any change -- including a shift in the point of obligation -- to the RFS,\" Fuels America said in an emailed statement. \"We also expressed our appreciation to the White House for making it clear that no such order is being developed.\"\n\nPresidential Memorandum\n\nAlthough Trump could set the work in motion with a presidential memorandum directing the EPA to act, it could take a year or more for regulators to formally implement the change.\n\nThe agency would have to justify its decision to move the point of obligation from refiners to blenders -- a move made harder by the Obama administration\u2019s proposed denial of such a change last November. A public comment period on that issue closed last week.\n\nOpponents say the change would inject uncertainty into the marketplace, suddenly forcing companies that have never participated in the Renewable Fuel Standard to comply with annual biofuel quotas. The upheaval could derail efforts to put more ethanol into the nation\u2019s gasoline, they say.\n\nKyle Gilley, the senior vice president of external affairs and communications at Poet, said in an op-ed that it would derail the Renewable Fuel Standard, \"imposing new burdens on small businesses and requiring the EPA to fundamentally restructure the fuel market, a process that could delay higher biofuel targets for years.\"\n\nNew Burdens\n\nSeparately, the American Petroleum Institute has argued the move would strip momentum from efforts to repeal or overhaul the renewable fuel mandate in Congress. On Thursday, the API joined 14 other organizations in a letter to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt urging the EPA not to change the point of organization.\n\nRepublicans in Congress also are resisting.\n\nRepresentative John Shimkus, an Illinois Republican who is a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and is spearheading an effort to revamp the program, said it would be a bad idea for the EPA to make the structural shift.\n\n\"The vast majority of obligated parties are in opposition to changing the point of obligation,\" Shimkus said. \"Changing that really empowers a minority.\"\n\nRepublican Iowa Senator Charles Grassley said he spoke White House officials who assured him no change is pending or imminent. \"Moving the point of obligation from a handful of refiners to hundreds or thousands of small fuel retailers would undermine the integrity and viability of this successful program,\" he said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Democrat Amy Klobuchar said Icahn\u2019s dual role as advocate and White House adviser deserves \"serious scrutiny.\"\n\n\"Rather than proposals that generate potential conflicts of interest, we should be doing what is in the best interest of rural economies and consumers,\u201d she said in a statement.", "date": "2017-03-02 00:00:00", "title": "White House Debates Icahn Plan Revamping Ethanol Rule"}

Lyft Inc. is worth more than its recent $2 billion valuation, based on the $50 billion value of larger car-hailing rival Uber Technologies Inc., Icahn said, after he led a fundraising round at Lyft last week.\n\nBillionaire Carl Icahn\u2019s relationship with President Donald Trump has helped spark a round of recriminations within the $24 billion American ethanol industry just as it navigates one of the most crucial points in its history.\n\nThe discord has emerged in the past three days as ethanol companies react to a proposal from Icahn and a lobby group that would shake up how the industry is regulated.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute lies the question of who exactly should be responsible for complying with a 12-year-old law mandating the blending of ethanol in gasoline. Icahn, a renowned corporate raider, controls one of the largest independent U.S. refiners. He argued loudly and repeatedly during the general election that the burden shouldn\u2019t fall on companies like his but on fuel blenders instead.\n\nIcahn\u2019s position is anathema to most of the biofuels industry. That made it all the more surprising when it emerged Feb. 27 that the 81-year-old billionaire -- now a special regulatory adviser to President -- had won the backing of the Renewable Fuels Association. The Washington-based lobbying group\u2019s president, Bob Dinneen, had long opposed the kind of change Icahn advocates, yet his group is now backing the proposal, which is being discussed in the White House. The news roiled the gasoline and corn markets -- and triggered an unprecedented display of public disunity from ethanol producers.\n\n\u2018Back-Room Deal\u2019\n\n\u201cWe believe the Renewable Fuels Association has been bought, sold and delivered on a platter,\" Todd Becker, chief executive officer of Green Plains Inc., which isn\u2019t a member of the lobby group.\n\nIn November, the renewable fuels unit of Valero Energy Corp., the largest independent U.S. refiner, joined the Renewable Fuels Association. The company endorses the move championed by Icahn, and Becker said that may have helped to sway the deal. \u201cBob Dinneen sold his soul to the devil,\u201d Becker said of Valero joining the group.\n\nAlso under fire is how the proposed deal was presented to the Trump administration without wider consultation. Poet LLC, the largest U.S. ethanol producer and a founder of Growth Energy, a separate trade group vehemently opposed to the Icahn move, called the agreement \"a back-room deal\" made while \"leading voices\" were absent.\n\nWhite House officials have spent the past two days in deliberations with Icahn and with ethanol producers who oppose his proposal, according to people familiar with the talks. The flurry of meetings and phone calls came after Bloomberg News reported Monday that Icahn had helped broker a compromise with Dinneen\u2019s group. The report led to a surge of more than $100 million in the value of Icahn\u2019s stake in refiner CVR Energy Inc.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Kelly Love said Wednesday there\u2019s no executive order in the works dealing with ethanol. She didn\u2019t directly respond to questions about the status of discussions.\n\nCompliance Costs\n\nWhile ethanol regulation can be esoteric at the best of times, the industry has considerable political clout in Washington. It\u2019s a major part of the economy in the U.S. Corn Belt, where voters helped Trump to the White House. Many in the region are waiting to see what Trump will do to support the farming sector.\n\nUntil this week, the biofuels industry had been united in fighting against changes to the mandate, arguing that to do so would undermine the intent of the program -- to increase use of ethanol and biodiesel.\n\nCVR and other gasoline refiners countered that the current costs of complying with the mandate are excessive. Refineries that can\u2019t add ethanol to gasoline are currently forced to buy credits to meet the requirements. Icahn has warned of bankruptcies.\n\nThe most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.\n\nJust last week, the Renewable Fuels Association filed comments with the Environmental Protection Agency asking that the agency block Icahn\u2019s demands. But everything changed, Dinneen said, after he was contacted by the White House and told in \u201cno uncertain terms\u201d that Icahn\u2019s request would be granted. Dinneen said he then tried to get support from within the industry to get the best deal available.\n\nUnprecedented \"Brouhaha\"\n\nNow there\u2019s disarray in the biofuels world. Fuels America, a lobby group with members throughout the agricultural supply chain, said Tuesday it had severed ties with the Renewable Fuels Association. Both the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association and the Illinois Renewable Fuels Association said they oppose any efforts to change the law.\n\nDinneen declined to comment, other than to say he continues to \u201chave great respect for the Fuels America coalition and its members.\u201d\n\nGrowth Energy said Dinneen\u2019s organization doesn\u2019t speak for the majority of the biofuels industry. Emily Skor, the group\u2019s CEO, said she was caught off guard by the Icahn pact and has spent the past few days talking to policymakers, lawmakers and journalists to explain the distinction between her organization, whose members are still opposed to the deal, and the Renewable Fuels Association. Skor, who started her job in May, says she\u2019s been told that the current industry \"brouhaha\" is unprecedented.", "date": "2017-03-02 00:00:00", "title": "Icahn\u2019s Trump Relationship Sparks a Civil War in the U.S. Ethanol Industry"}

Here\u2019s a look at some of the priorities highlighted in the president\u2019s address, and where they stand in Congress:\n\nHealth Care\n\nTrump did sketch out a few broad parameters for his health-care plan, saying the GOP should use \"tax credits and expanded health savings accounts\u201d to help Americans purchase their own coverage.\n\nRyan quickly seized on that statement, saying that Trump was \"coalescing\u201d with GOP leaders on their plan for refundable tax credits. But that element has become a major sticking point in the party, with the heads of two conservative groups of House members announcing this week that they won\u2019t vote for legislation that includes that element.\n\n\"He didn\u2019t say refundable tax credit, he said tax credit. There\u2019s a world of difference between the two,\" said Republican Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina, who has introduced his own health-care plan. \"I think we all hear what we want to hear in the world of politics.\u201d\n\nTrump did call for giving more control of the Medicaid program to states, while still providing resources \"to make sure no one is left out,\u201d a statement that could give ammunition to some Republicans who want to fight conservatives\u2019 plans for a fuller rollback of Obamacare\u2019s expansion of the program.\n\nSenate GOP leaders are holding a closed-door meeting Wednesday afternoon to discuss the Obamacare repeal effort with House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady and House Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden.\n\nTax Overhaul\n\nIn promising \"massive tax relief for the middle class,\" Trump talked about his unhappiness over \"very high tariffs and taxes\" that he says put American products at a disadvantage in the global market.\n\nBut his remarks about putting companies on a more even playing field fell short of backing a plan being pushed by Ryan for a border-adjusted tax, the linchpin of a broader Republican effort to deliver significant tax cuts.\n\nThe lack of new details reflects a deep split within the Trump administration over the border-adjustment plan. Ryan\u2019s plan is backed by several senior Trump advisers, including top strategist Steve Bannon, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, according to a senior administration official and a person familiar with the sessions. But Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn remain opposed.\n\nCongress, too, remains deeply split, with many Senate Republicans openly opposed to border adjustment. Outside groups, meanwhile, are battling over the issue. Retailers, automakers and oil refiners that rely on imported oil oppose the plan and say it would mean higher costs for consumers. Proponents, including General Electric Co. and Oracle Corp., say border adjustments would lead to increased domestic production, more jobs and a stronger dollar, which would reduce the costs of imports and increase the costs of exports.\n\nGOP leaders say they\u2019re hoping to enact a major tax bill before the August recess, but they have only offered a broad outline and face a daunting backlog of other legislative imperatives, including the Obamacare repeal, the looming expiration of government funding on April 28 and the need to raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling.\n\nBorder Wall\n\nThe president made several references to the wall he promised to build along the U.S.-Mexico border, while omitting his campaign promise that Mexico would pay for it.\n\n\"We will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border,\" Trump said in the speech.\n\nBut there was no mention of how to pay for it, and his administration has yet to offer any details about timing, design or dollar figures.\n\nTrump has estimated the wall can be built for a figure ranging from $8 billion to $12 billion. Congressional Republicans have said they expect it would cost from $12 billion to $15 billion, based on what it cost to build existing border fencing. Other estimates have put the total much higher.\n\nRyan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have said they support providing funding to build a wall, but it\u2019s unclear when they would try to provide the funding -- and whether Congress would have to find offsetting cuts to avoid adding to the deficit.\n\nDefense Spending\n\nTrump\u2019s promise to upgrade the military -- giving it \u201cthe resources its brave warriors so richly deserve\u201d -- is one case in which he\u2019s offered a specific dollar figure. But that has only underscored the difficulty he\u2019ll have getting it through Congress.\n\nThe administration is proposing a $54 billion increase in defense spending for the fiscal year that begins in October -- paid for through equal cuts from domestic programs and foreign aid.\n\nKeep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily.\n\nDemocrats have made clear they will oppose lifting budget caps on defense spending without doing the same for domestic programs. Republican defense hawks led by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain have said Trump isn\u2019t proposing a big enough Pentagon increase. And members of both parties have objected to cutting deeply into foreign aid programs at the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nTrump has signaled that his long-term defense goals include increasing the number of Army troops and the size of the Navy fleet. In the short term, Trump has said the Pentagon is \u201clooking seriously at a big order\u201d of Boeing Co.\u2019s Super Hornet fighter jet, and defense officials said that may be among the early spending moves.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nTrump asked Congress to \u201capprove legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States -- financed through both public and private capital,\u201d even though no such bills have been drafted.\n\nThe Association of Equipment Manufacturers said before the speech that its \u201cmembers are eager to hear President Trump detail the scope of his infrastructure proposal, and identify a method for funding it.\u201d\n\nSo, too, would lawmakers. Ryan and other House conservatives were less than enthusiastic before Trump\u2019s election as president over his talk about such an infrastructure plan. More recently, Ryan has suggested congressional Republicans might go along with a plan that relies largely on private-sector funding.\n\nBut Democrats -- who have long called for upgrading road, bridges and mass transit -- have made clear that their support will be contingent on a significant infusion of public financing.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s missing is a real plan and the money,\u201d Peter DeFazio, the top Democrat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said after the speech. \u201cOther than that it\u2019s great.\u201d", "date": "2017-03-01 00:00:00", "title": "Trump\u2019s To-Do List Vexes Congress a Day After His Big Speech"}

Its market valuation at the IPO price, of about $20 billion, implies a multiple of about 21.4 times EMarketer\u2019s estimate for Snap\u2019s 2017 advertising sales.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-01/carlos-slim-is-16-billion-poorer-but-a-whole-lot-more-popular", "sourcename": "bloomberg", "response_body": "On June 15, 2015, the day before Donald Trump launched his presidential bid, Carlos Slim\u2019s personal fortune stood at just under $67 billion.\n\nToday, it\u2019s about $51 billion.\n\nNo one on earth has lost more during Trump\u2019s rise \u2014 from a dollar and cents standpoint, at least \u2014 than the Mexican telecom magnate. His rank on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index has slipped to sixth after having once held the No. 1 spot. Some of the reasons behind his tumble, of course, have little to do with U.S. politics, but much of it comes down to this: Trump\u2019s tough talk on Mexico has sunk the peso, dragging down the dollar-based value of Slim\u2019s domestic assets in the process.\n\nThere\u2019s another, entirely unexpected, element to the Slim saga, though. The very same forces that are shrinking his fortune are, oddly enough, also boosting his popularity at home \u2014 to the extent that he is now talked about wistfully as a candidate in next year\u2019s presidential election. After Slim met with Trump in a December visit, Mexicans outraged by Trump\u2019s vow to step up deportations and build a border wall at Mexico\u2019s expense started to warm to the idea that the 77-year-old tycoon could be exactly what the country needs.\n\nA poll by El Universal in January showed that Slim was considered the best-suited Mexican to face Trump, edging out populist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the early frontrunner. His calls for the Mexican economy to look inward, as much as his vast fortune and defiance of Trump, have resonated with Mexicans. And while long reviled at home for his hard-ball business practices, Slim has become politically palatable as cell phone bills have fallen because of a price war and regulatory crackdown.\n\nLongshot Candidacy\n\nHis candidacy may be a longshot \u2014 he told Bloomberg TV in December that he\u2019d \u201cnever\u201d run for office \u2014 but Mexicans are hopeful.\n\n\u201cSlim said he wasn\u2019t interested,\u201d said David Crow, a political analyst at Mexico City research center Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas. \u201cNobody quite believes him or wants to believe him. He out-Trumps Trump. He\u2019s similar as a private sector guy, but he\u2019s fabulously wealthy and far outpaces Trump in that regard.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Slim, the world\u2019s richest person as recently as 2013, is worth 17 times more than Trump\u2019s current $3 billion.\n\nAs for his newfound popularity, a spokesman said the drop in mobile phone bills for Mexicans isn\u2019t necessarily the reason. \u201cFortunately, Mexican people have started to realize he\u2019s an honest, smart and principled businessman who has helped many others,\u201d Arturo Elias Ayub said from Mexico City.\n\nStrained Relations\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign talk strained relations with Slim. After Trump\u2019s accusation that Mexico was sending rapists and other criminals to the U.S., Slim\u2019s Ora TV network quickly dropped a television project with the then-candidate.\n\nWhen the New York Times later dug up allegations of Trump\u2019s sexual harassment, he claimed reporters were acting as \u201ccorporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim,\u201d a reference to his 17 percent holding in the newspaper company, the biggest individual shareholder.\n\nBut after Trump won, peace negotiations began. Slim traveled to Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s estate in Palm Beach, Florida, for what the president-elect called \u201ca lovely dinner with a wonderful man.\u201d When Slim spoke to reporters in Mexico weeks later, he criticized the proposed wall, saying investment and job creation are better ways to stem immigration. He had kind words for Trump, however, even holding up a copy of the president\u2019s latest book, \u201cGreat Again,\u201d for photos.\n\nViral Video\n\n\u201cTrump is not The Terminator,\u201d he reassured his fellow Mexicans, whose ire for Trump had turned the American billionaire into a best-selling pinata. \u201cHe\u2019s a negotiator.\u201d\n\nThe reconciliation, a result of weeks of backdoor negotiations, came at a time when President Enrique Pena Nieto was deeply unpopular and at odds with Trump. (Pena Nieto can\u2019t run for another term.)\n\nSoon after, a local TV network in southern Mexico seized the moment to create a video calling for Slim to run as a presidential candidate in 2018. The clip went viral, and pro-Slim hashtags proliferated (#SlimPresidente, it turns out, eventually became an awkward place for America Movil clients to air their phone bill grievances).\n\nMexico hasn\u2019t always loved Slim. His extreme wealth didn\u2019t sit well with many in a country mired in poverty, since much of his fortune was derived from his acquisition of the state-run telephone network in a privatization sale. For years, Slim has battled allegations, based on scant evidence, that he won the 1990 auction for Telefonos de Mexico because of favoritism.\n\nMexico\u2019s regulator also fined his group $1 billion for \u201cmonopolistic practices\u201d in 2011 by overcharging competitors for connecting calls. Slim fought the fine in courts for years, but by the time he won, the government had started to chip away at his dominance by ensuring customers could more easily switch phone providers.\n\nNon-Mexico Investments\n\nThe arrival of the Trump era presents many questions for Slim and his family fortune. While the decline in Slim\u2019s fortune seems to be a harbinger, a closer look shows his net worth sliding less than the peso. The impact on Slim was mitigated by his diversification away from Mexico \u2014 the country only accounts for about a quarter of America Movil\u2019s revenue, followed by Brazil, the U.S. and Austria after his recent takeover of Telekom Austria.\n\nHis gold and silver mining operation Minera Frisco was a hit last year, and his bet on a Spanish real estate recovery paid off with his Fomento de Construcciones y Co., up more than 30 percent over 12 months.\n\nSlim may also be able to seize on the opportunities of a more inward-looking Mexican economy in a Trumpian world. An auto company controlled by Slim has been working on a Mexican-made electric car in a partnership with bread giant Bimbo. He\u2019s also slated to lead in an infrastructure build-up, after a Slim-led consortium won a $4 billion contract for a Mexico City airport terminal.\n\nObrador Relationship\n\nThe most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.\n\nAssuming Slim doesn\u2019t run for president, he may be well-positioned if Obrador rides the anti-Trump wave to victory. Slim has somehow managed to stay on good terms with Obrador over the years, despite his disdain for monopolists and inequality, after the odd couple teamed up to revamp Mexico City\u2019s historic downtown when Obrador was mayor. Crow says it doesn\u2019t hurt that the daughter of an Obrador aide is married to Slim\u2019s son in a country where personal connections weigh heavily in politics.\n\nMeanwhile, Slim\u2019s wealth is creeping back, having gained $5.6 billion since it hit a low on Nov. 11 \u2014 equal to about double what Trump is worth. Trump is aware of the disparity. When David Letterman compared their net worth in a 2015 interview, Trump sheepishly acknowledged Slim\u2019s vast fortune, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t feel so good when you mention Carlos Slim.\u201d It\u2019s now one of the most famous Trump quotes south of the border.", "date": "2017-03-01 00:00:00", "title": "Carlos Slim Is $16 Billion Poorer But a Whole Lot More Popular"}
{"sourceurl": "https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-09/why-trump-might-target-iran-s-revolutionary-guard-quicktake-q-a", "sourcename": "bloomberg", "response_body": "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is weighing whether to list Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization, a decision that would have economic, political and geopolitical implications because of the enormous might it wields. A move against the Guards -- the official protector of the Islamic revolution -- would fit with Trump\u2019s push to get tough on Iran, whose 2015 nuclear agreement with six world powers, he argues, will \" give\" the country nuclear weapons. Trump\u2019s administration warned it was putting Iran \" on notice\" for test-firing a ballistic missile on Jan. 29. The U.S. accuses Iran of violating United Nations restrictions on its ballistic missile program. Iran says the program is a sovereign affair and doesn\u2019t contravene UN resolutions because it isn\u2019t aimed at conveying atomic weapons. The Revolutionary Guards control the ballistic missile program.\n\n1. Who are the Revolutionary Guards?\n\n\n\nThe 100,000-strong corps was established at the outset of the 1979 Islamic revolution as a trusted security force at a time when the military\u2019s loyalty to Iran\u2019s new leaders was unclear. The nation\u2019s premier security force, the corps has its own ground, air and naval divisions as well as a chain of command separate from the military that leads directly to Iran\u2019s highest authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The Guards have amassed sweeping commercial interests, including in the energy and construction industries. In recent years, Revolutionary Guards have provided military support to President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria, a strategic ally of Iran.\n\n2. What\u2019s their alleged connection to terrorism?\n\n\n\nThe U.S. has listed Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984, accusing it of providing assistance to a variety of groups that have carried out terrorist attacks, including Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah movement and Iraqi Shiite groups. It says the Qods Force, the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 international brigade, is Iran\u2019s \u201c primary mechanism\u201d for supporting terrorists abroad.\n\n3. What sanctions does the U.S. already impose on the Guards?\n\nThe U.S. accuses the Guards of supporting terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, abusing Iranian and Syrian human rights, and stirring regional instability. The U.S. directly sanctions several of the Guards\u2019 commanders and a number of Iranian firms linked to the forces. Contractors who do business with the U.S. government cannot have \u201csignificant transaction with\u201d the Guards. Sanctions are imposed on individuals who \u201cmaterially assist\u201d the Guards and on foreign banks that conduct significant business with the forces.\n\n4. What would designating the Guards a terrorist group change?\n\n\n\nIt would expose considerably more of the Iranian economy to both direct and secondary U.S. sanctions. The U.S. has sanctioned 25 companies of the Revolutionary Guards, when at least 229 are significantly under its influence, according to one study. Scholars estimate that the Guards control from 20 percent to 40 percent of Iran\u2019s economy. Naming the Guards a terrorist group would further restrict the number of Iranian companies that foreign companies could legally work with and make them more skittish than they already are about doing business in Iran. A terrorist label \u201cups the reputational concern for companies looking to deal with Iran,\u201d said Mahmoud Fadlallah, a Dubai-based partner at the law firm Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP. The U.S. message would be \u201cwe\u2019re going to shut you down, we\u2019re adversarial to companies coming in and investing,\u201d said Amir Handjani, a senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council based in Dubai.\n\n5. Would the Iran nuclear deal survive?\n\nClassifying one of the armed forces of a country as a terrorist organization is unprecedented. Such a move would lead hardliners in Iran to pressure Khamenei to put an end to the deal, analysts said. If the Trump administration\u2019s thinking is to push Iran into a position where politically it feels it needs to walk away, then \u201cthis is a tactically good step to make,\u201d said Henry Smith, lead analyst on Iran and the Middle East at the Dubai office of Control Risks, a research group.\n\n6. How else might Iran react?\n\nKeep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily.\n\nMembers of the Guards deployed outside Iran, supporting the regime in Syria and helping to roll back Islamic State gains there and in Iraq, are liable to strike back at the U.S. by \u201ccreating more chaos\u201d in those two countries, said Mahjoob Zweiri a professor of Middle Eastern politics at Qatar University in Doha. That would complicate Washington\u2019s campaign against Islamic State and efforts to resolve the conflict in Syria.\n\n7. How could it affect Iran\u2019s May election?\n\n\n\nIt would give ammunition to hardliners in Iran who already see the U.S. as \u201can enemy that can\u2019t be trusted,\u201d said Afshin Shahi, senior lecturer in international relations and Middle East politics at the University of Bradford in the U.K. That would weaken the re-election prospects of incumbent President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate and the architect of the nuclear deal. The Guards would throw the U.S. action in his face, said the Atlantic Council\u2019s Handjani. \u201cThey will say, \u2018You\u2019re the one who signed that deal, look what they are doing to us now.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Reference Shelf\n\n", "date": "2017-02-09 00:00:00", "title": "Why Trump Might Target Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard: QuickTake Q&A"}

On this particular night in early February\u2014Super Bowl Sunday\u2014Kalanick is perched in the middle seat, flanked by two female friends. Maroon 5\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Wanna Know\u201d plays, and Kalanick shimmies. He clutches his smartphone as the three make awkward conversation. The two women ask when his birthday is, and marvel that he\u2019s a Leo. One of his companions appears to say, somewhat inaudibly, that she\u2019s heard that Uber is having a hard year. Kalanick retorts, \u201cI make sure every year is a hard year.\u201d He continues, \u201cThat\u2019s kind of how I roll. I make sure every year is a hard year. If it\u2019s easy I\u2019m not pushing hard enough.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no question that it\u2019s been a hard year for Kalanick and Uber\u2014or really, a bad year compressed down into an awful three months. And it keeps getting worse. That pleasant conversation between Kalanick and his friends in the back of an Uber Black? It devolved into a heated argument over Uber\u2019s fares between the CEO and his driver, Fawzi Kamel, who then turned over a dashboard recording of the conversation to Bloomberg. Kamel, 37, has been driving for Uber since 2011 and wants to draw attention to the plight of Uber drivers. The video shows off Kalanick's pugnacious personality and short temper, which may cause some investors to question whether he has the disposition to lead a $69 billion company with a footprint that spans the globe.\n\nIn an email to staff Tuesday after publication of this story, Kalanick apologized to Kamel for treating him disrespectfully. \u201cTo say that I am ashamed is an extreme understatement,\u201d Kalanick wrote. \u201cMy job as your leader is to lead\u2026and that starts with behaving in a way that makes us all proud. That is not what I did, and it cannot be explained away. It\u2019s clear this video is a reflection of me\u2014and the criticism we\u2019ve received is a stark reminder that I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up. This is the first time I\u2019ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.\u201d\n\nIn December, Uber pulled its self-driving cars off the road in San Francisco after the California Department of Motor Vehicles said they were operating illegally without an autonomous vehicle license. In January, more than 200,000 people uninstalled their accounts, and #DeleteUber trended on Twitter, after the company was accused of undermining a New York taxi union strike protesting President Donald Trump\u2019s refugee ban. On Feb. 2, Kalanick reluctantly left his spot on Trump\u2019s business advisory council to appease the company\u2019s liberal-leaning employees and users\u2014not to mention its many immigrant drivers. On Feb. 19, a former software engineer at Uber wrote a blog post alleging that she had been propositioned for sex by her manager and that when she\u2019d taken the issue to human resources, an HR rep had said that he wouldn\u2019t be punished, in part, because he was a \u201chigh performer.\u201d On Feb. 23, Alphabet\u2019s autonomous car company Waymo sued Uber and its self-driving car company Otto, accusing an Uber employee of stealing trade secrets by downloading 14,000 files onto an external hard drive. On Monday, Uber\u2019s head of engineering resigned after the company said it learned that he had faced a sexual harassment complaint at Alphabet, his former employer. He denied the allegations.\n\n\u201cSome people don't like to take responsibility for their own shit.\u201d\n\nThe company has responded to the former engineer\u2019s allegations by hiring the former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder to investigate the female software engineer\u2019s claims. \u201cWhat\u2019s described here is abhorrent & against everything we believe in. Anyone who behaves this way or thinks this is OK will be fired,\u201d Kalanick wrote on Twitter. On Waymo\u2019s claims that Uber has stolen trade secrets, an Uber spokeswoman said, \u201cWe have reviewed Waymo\u2019s claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor, and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court.\u201d\n\nDespite it all, Uber\u2019s business is growing, week after week. This is the service that Kalanick and his friend, Garrett Camp, dreamed up. Get a car in an instant, just like James Bond. They weren\u2019t the first people to have that idea, but they were the ones who won\u2014or at least the ones who have gotten the furthest. Camp stepped back and became chairman of the board, while Kalanick turned Uber into a global endeavor that operates in more than 400 cities. The company, which has its headquarters on Market Street in San Francisco, has more than 11,000 corporate employees. It has many more drivers\u2014millions of them, scattered all over the world, working as independent contractors, without the health care and other benefits typically provided to full-time employees.\n\nAnd the gig has gotten harder for longtime drivers. In 2012, Uber Black cost riders $4.90 per mile or $1.25 per minute in San Francisco, according to an old version of Uber's website. Today, Uber charges $3.75 per mile and $0.65 per minute. Black car drivers get paid less and their business faces far more competition from other Uber services.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of how I roll. I make sure every year is a hard year. If it\u2019s easy I\u2019m not pushing hard enough.\u201d\n\nKalanick has a reputation for being ferociously competitive and hard-charging. He\u2019s the guy who has bragged about having earned the second-highest rank on Nintendo\u2019s Wii tennis game. He\u2019s still dogged by the fact that he once referred to Uber as \u201cBoob-er\u201d because it improved his dating prospects. Current and former employees say he can be empathetic when the mood strikes\u2014or tyrannical when it doesn\u2019t. Kalanick loves fighting over a good idea, which sometimes means admitting that his isn\u2019t the best one. \u201cToe-stepping\u201d is one of Uber\u2019s cultural values.\n\nKalanick is trying to be a better listener. He met with more than 100 of Uber\u2019s female employees at a meeting last week meant to address the morale crisis that followed the former software engineer\u2019s blog post. Kalanick sounded some of the right notes, standing in front of the crowd. \u201cThere are people in this room who have experienced things that are incredibly unjust,\u201d he said, according to a recording obtained by Buzzfeed. \u201cI empathize with you, but I can never fully understand, and I get that. I want to root out the injustice. I want to get at the people who are making this place a bad place, and you have my commitment to make that happen, and I know it doesn't end there.\u201d\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nLike Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg before him, Kalanick is trying to learn how to empathize and communicate. But Kalanick at 40, compared with 32-year-old Zuckerberg, is having to change his ways later in life, and he\u2019s often reluctant to tread too far from his intuitions. Even when Kalanick tries to empathize in his own way\u2014which often means jumping into a dialectical argument of sorts\u2014 his temper can occasionally flare.\n\nIn Kamel's car, for example, Kalanick is seemingly at ease as the ride ends and his friends hop out of the car.\n\n\u201cYou have a good one,\u201d says the driver.\n\nKalanick says with an air of familiarity, \u201cGood to see you man.\u201d\n\nKamel replies, \u201cGood to see you, too.\u201d\n\nKalanick thinks the ride is over. But having the CEO in his car is an opportunity Kamel has been waiting for.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you remember me, but it\u2019s fine,\u201d Kamel says. The pair begin talking shop, and Kalanick explains that they\u2019re going to cut down on the number of black cars, which will reduce competition and should be good for Kamel.\n\nThen Kamel says what every driver has been dying to tell Kalanick: \u201cYou\u2019re raising the standards, and you\u2019re dropping the prices.\u201d\n\nKalanick: \u201cWe\u2019re not dropping the prices on black.\u201d\n\nKamel: \u201cBut in general the whole price is\u2014\u201d\n\nKalanick: \u201cWe have to; we have competitors; otherwise, we\u2019d go out of business.\u201d\n\nKamel: \u201cCompetitors? Man, you had the business model in your hands. You could have the prices you want, but you choose to buy everybody a ride.\u201d\n\nKalanick: \u201cNo, no no. You misunderstand me. We started high-end. We didn\u2019t go low-end because we wanted to. We went low-end because we had to because we\u2019d be out of business.\u201d\n\nKamel: \u201cWhat? Lyft? It\u2019s a piece of cake right there.\u201d\n\nKalanick: \u201cIt seems like a piece of cake because I\u2019ve beaten them. But if I didn\u2019t do the things I did, we would have been beaten, I promise.\u201d\n\nThe two bat that idea around, and Kamel brings the conversation back to his losses.\n\nKamel: \u201cBut people are not trusting you anymore. \u2026 I lost $97,000 because of you. I'm bankrupt because of you. Yes, yes, yes. You keep changing every day. You keep changing every day.\u201d\n\nKalanick: \u201cHold on a second, what have I changed about Black? What have I changed?\u201d\n\nKamel: \u201cYou changed the whole business. You dropped the prices.\u201d\n\nKalanick: \u201cOn black?\u201d\n\nKamel: \u201cYes, you did.\u201d\n\nKalanick begins to lose his temper. \u201cBullshit,\u201d he says.\n\nKamel: \u201cWe started with $20.\u201d\n\nKalanick: \u201cBullshit.\u201d\n\nKamel: \u201cWe started with $20. How much is the mile now, $2.75?\u201d\n\nKalanick: \u201cYou know what?\u201d\n\nKamel: \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nKalanick: \u201cSome people don't like to take responsibility for their own shit. They blame everything in their life on somebody else. Good luck!\u201d\n\nKamel: \u201cGood luck to you, but I know [you're not] going to go far.\u201d\n\nThe door slams. Kamel drives away. Later, the Uber driver app prompts him to rate Kalanick, as he does all his riders. Kamel gives him one star.", "date": "2017-02-28 00:00:00", "title": "In Video, Uber CEO Argues With Driver Over Falling Fares"}

The repercussions of that effort will be reverberating through U.S. as well as European politics in the year ahead.\n\n1. What do U.S. officials think happened?\n\nA consensus has emerged among U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies, including the CIA and FBI, that the Russian hacking began as a broad operation to collect information on Democratic and Republican groups with an aim to interfere in elections and undermine confidence in American democracy. Intelligence agencies became confident the Russian government directed the hacking and that \u201conly Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,\" the Office of Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security said in a joint statement one month before the Nov. 8 election.\n\n2. Then why the suspicion that the Russians targeted Clinton?\n\nThe Russian operation morphed into a targeted campaign to damage Clinton after hackers obtained disparaging information from the DNC and from the Gmail account of John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, in the view of U.S. officials. Seizing on an opportunity, the hackers and senior officials in the Russian government strategically leaked the information through websites including WikiLeaks, the officials said.\n\n3. Did hackers manipulate the actual vote count?\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence of that, officials say. Most voting machines aren\u2019t connected to the internet.\n\n4. Were the Russians trying to help Donald Trump win?\n\nThat\u2019s the gist of what the CIA presented to the Senate Intelligence Committee after the election, although the FBI hasn\u2019t reached that definitive conclusion. In addition to evidence the CIA has obtained, but hasn\u2019t made public, the agency\u2019s conclusion is based on its observation that information stolen from Republican groups wasn\u2019t made public anywhere near as aggressively as the anti-Clinton information.\n\n5. Why aren\u2019t the CIA and FBI on the same page?\n\nIt\u2019s not that they disagree. Rather, they have different functions. Part of the CIA\u2019s mission is to assess the intent of adversaries; the FBI, as a law-enforcement agency, relies on evidence it can prove in court or to a judge. In a message to his workforce on Dec. 16, CIA Director John Brennan said he had met with FBI Director James Comey and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and \"there is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature, and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election.\"\n\n6. What was Putin\u2019s role?\n\nIntelligence officials have little doubt that the targeted effort to damage Clinton was done with Putin\u2019s knowledge. President Barack Obama stopped short of confirming Putin\u2019s personal involvement during a press conference on Dec. 16, but left little doubt. \u201cNot much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin,\u201d he said.\n\n7.

The Czech National Bank raised its forecast of price growth for this year following its acceleration to the 2 percent target in December. This is no reason to bring forward the exit from the intervention policy, according to Rusnok.\n\n\u201cWe certainly don\u2019t feel any need for a hasty reaction,\u201d Rusnok told reporters after the meeting. \u201cWe need to see robust fulfillment of the target, and for us, that means some overshooting of this inflation target.\u201d\n\nThe monetary authority reviewed its policy after a spike in inflows into the koruna last month.

While the five permanent members can always veto resolutions or decisions, they usually try to win majority support from other Security Council members for their cause instead. That\u2019s where the new American president\u2019s approach comes in.\n\nForeign diplomats \u201cwill be flying blind\u201d with Trump, said Richard Gowan, a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cMany expect him to work more closely with Russia but are not sure how far this will go.\u201d\n\nUkraine, Syria\n\nFew countries have more at stake than Ukraine, which is keenly focused on whether the U.S. will continue to stand with other nations in not recognizing Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, or if Washington softens its stance -- and eases sanctions -- in return for more cooperation against terrorism. Syria\u2019s beleaguered opposition, which Russia has targeted for bombing in its support of President Bashar al-Assad, could be wiped out if the U.S. shifts policy and withholds its support.\n\nThe U.K., which boasts of its \u201cspecial relationship\u201d to the U.S., is said to be deeply concerned that Trump\u2019s admiration for President Vladimir Putin will give Russia sway in eastern Europe, according to two senior officials, who asked not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May met with Trump in Washington Jan. 27, and Trump spoke with Putin by phone for about an hour the following day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say you want to put \u2018America first\u2019 and try new things, but this is not the right time to turn your back on alliances that have served us for 70 years,\" said Edward Luck, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs. \u201cYou may think it\u2019s time to approach diplomacy differently but you cannot throw out the baby with the bathwater.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s new UN ambassador, Nikki Haley, was known as a conciliator in her past job as governor of South Carolina, she arrived at her new post last week with a stern warning indicating she\u2019s ready to pursue Trump\u2019s pugnacious stance at the world body. The U.S. will \u201chave the backs of our allies and make sure that our allies have our back as well,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cFor those that don\u2019t have our back, we\u2019re taking names.\n\nHaley\u2019s first test may come Tuesday after the U.S. called for an emergency Security Council meeting on an Iranian ballistic-missile launch. The U.S. and allies have condemned such tests as violating the spirit of the UN resolution that ratified the deal curbing Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Iran says the resolution\u2019s prohibition applies only to missiles specially designed to carry nuclear warheads.\n\n\u2018Mother Teresa\u2019\n\nUnder President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, the Russia-U.S. relationship soured to the point that the Security Council\u2019s work was largely paralyzed.

China has supported Russia\u2019s positions in vetoing five resolutions on Syria since 2011. Now, with Trump saying an alliance with Moscow would be an \u201casset,\u201d it could be even harder for less powerful countries to get the support they need for such action.\n\n\u201cPutin, Trump and Xi are a trio of most unfriendly leaders for multilateral cooperation since the end of the Cold War, if not the beginning of the UN,\u201d said Michael Doyle, a former UN assistant secretary-general, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Settlements\n\nThe UN is already bracing to be on defense because Haley is taking her seat with support from a president and a U.S. Congress furious over a Security Council resolution in December critical of Israel\u2019s settlements policy.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s unexpected decision to abstain from the resolution allowed it to pass, and U.S. lawmakers from both parties have fumed ever since. In her Jan. 18 confirmation hearing, Haley called the vote one of the body\u2019s most \u201coutrageous.\u201d Members of Congress are proposing to cut or freeze funding for the UN as a result.\n\nAsked about potential cuts in UN funding, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said last week that the president wants to be a \u201cstrong steward\u201d of tax dollars. The U.S. provides about $8 billion a year in contributions to the UN through the State Department and other agencies, or about a fifth of the world body\u2019s total budget of $40 billion.\n\nOn Jan. 4, new UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called Trump and had a \u201cvery positive discussion,\u201d according to his spokesman. In one of his few tweets directed at the UN, Trump last month said, \u201cThe United Nations has such great potential, but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad.\u201d\n\nHaley\u2019s biggest challenge is that she\u2019s part of an administration that carries a deep distrust toward multilateral institutions like the UN, said Reva Goujon, an analyst at Stratfor, the geopolitical advisory company.\n\n\u2018Decidedly Weird\u2019\n\nThat suspicion as well as policy disagreements could lead to other ramifications at the UN. As bonds among the P3 loosen, the Russian-Chinese alliance at the UN could also suffer, Gowan said.\n\n\u201cIf Trump cozies up to Russia while continuing to pick fights with Beijing over trade and Taiwan, Security Council dynamics could become decidedly weird,\u201d Gowan said. \u201cWe could see Moscow and Washington trying to collaborate at the UN while Beijing maneuvers to undermine their cooperation.\u201d\n\nA key test may come in February, when Ukraine will hold the Security Council\u2019s rotating presidency. The country will be looking to ensure it still has the council\u2019s backing in its claims to Crimea and addressing instability on its eastern border.\n\n\u201cThe P3 have always been rock-solid supportive of Ukraine when it comes to the issue of Crimea,\u201d said Volodymyr Yelchenko, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the UN. \u201cWe have heard remarks of Mr. Trump on Crimea when he was a presidential candidate.

The Ford is being built by Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc., with advanced systems from a number of subcontractors, including Raytheon Co. and General Atomics.\n\nThe inclusion of unproven technologies was a decision \u201cmade long ago as part of a DoD-level initiative called \u2018Transformation,\u2019\u201d Kendall wrote.

The initial carrier current projected cost of $12.9 billion hits a congressionally mandated cost cap.\n\nThe Navy questions the value of the new review because it will be conducted during a peak period of seaboard testing and won\u2019t contribute to correcting deficiencies that the service is already dealing with, said a Navy official who asked not to be identified discussing the service\u2019s internal views on Kendall\u2019s decision.\n\nOther than capturing lessons learned, Kendall\u2019s review will have little bearing on the initial ship or the second vessel in the class, the CVN-79 -- the USS John F.

Renewable Fuels Association President and Chief Executive Officer Bob Dinneen read the letter aloud.\n\nThe letter came a day before the Environmental Protection Agency closes public comments Wednesday on whether it should grant an Icahn and oil refiner-led push to move the onus on responsibility for adhering to the so-called Renewable Fuel Standard. The law calls for escalating amounts of ethanol and biodiesel. Biofuel industry proponents oppose the change.\n\nPrices for compliance credits have plunged since Trump\u2019s election on speculation that his administration would be receptive to changing the program.

Prices for biofuel credits plunged on the news while futures contracts for corn, the raw material used to manufacture ethanol, surged.\n\nIt was unclear whether the accord would win traction in the Trump administration amid opposition from others in the oil and ethanol industries. White House spokeswoman Kelly Love said there was no executive order in the works dealing with ethanol.\n\nAs majority owner of refiner CVR Energy Inc., Icahn has pushed to shift the burden for complying with the biofuel quotas from refiners to fuel blenders. Icahn, who is also a special regulatory adviser to President Donald Trump, and other refiners have now won agreement from a major ethanol trade group to support shifting the point of obligation, as it\u2019s known within the industry.\n\nThe Renewable Fuels Association had just this month filed comments with the EPA opposing the move. But now it has agreed to back the change in return for a pledge for a waiver allowing gasoline blends containing 15 percent ethanol -- called E15 -- to be sold year-round in U.S. markets.\n\n\"I was told in no uncertain terms that the point of obligation was going to be moved, and I said I wanted to see one of our top agenda items moved,\u201d Bob Dinneen, head of the Renewable Fuels Association said in a phone interview.

Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nUnder current law, refiners and importers are obligated to meet annual quotas for using biodiesel and ethanol. Refiners are affected unevenly by the mandates. Those that do not have infrastructure to blend in the biofuels themselves must buy credits known as renewable identification numbers, or RINs, to comply. Under the current program structure, some blenders that don\u2019t actually refine fuels generate RINs every time they mix in biofuel. They can then sell those compliance credits to refiners that need them to satisfy the law.\n\nRINs tracking ethanol blending compliance in 2017 dropped 13 percent on the news, ending the day at 40 cents, the lowest since those tracking this year\u2019s consumption targets started trading. Earlier in the day they had dropped to 30 cents. Corn futures jumped as much as 4.9 percent before retreating to close up 1.5 percent.\n\nRural Support\n\nThe Renewable Fuels Association\u2019s support could help win backing from corn growers and Midwest voters who helped elect Trump last year. Trump made inroads in the U.S. Corn Belt proclaiming his support for the ethanol industry. But he has also made it a top priority to eliminate regulations and fight imports. This deal would do both.\n\nShifting the biofuel compliance burden also is important to another key Trump constituency: laborers in Pennsylvania who supported him at the ballot box last November. Advocates of the change, including the United Steelworkers union, argue that some Northeast refineries are imperiled by the current approach.\n\nThe three-part accord also aims to curb imports of biodiesel from Argentina by ensuring domestic producers qualify for a currently expired tax credit. That would require action from Congress, where the tax credit is up for renewal.\n\nSan Antonio-based Valero, and two other refiners -- HollyFrontier Corp. and Delta Air Lines Inc.\u2019s Monroe Energy LLC -- had petitioned the EPA to shift the obligation away from refiners to blenders. The EPA under the Obama administration proposed rejecting that.\n\n\u2018Protecting Jobs\u2019\n\nValero, one of the four biggest U.S. biofuel producers, joined the Renewable Fuels Association last November. In a statement, the company said it would welcome any efforts by the Trump administration \"to negotiate an acceptable compromise.\"\n\n\"Changing the RFS point of obligation is critical to protecting fuel manufacturing jobs, small-business retailers, energy security and U.S. consumers,\" Valero said.\n\nCritics say the change would introduce more uncertainty into the marketplace, by forcing companies that have never had to participate actively in the program to comply with the mandates. Growth Energy, a separate group of biofuel supporters, including producers POET LLC and Green Plains Inc., blasted the agreement.\n\n\"I assure you this is no deal for anyone but Carl Icahn,\" Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy, said in an emailed statement. \"This would gut the RFS and violate the president\u2019s commitment to the policy.\"\n\nPOET CEO Jeff Broin derided the agreement as a \"back-room deal made by people who want out of their obligations.\"\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute also has battled the administrative change, arguing that it would detract from broader attempts to overhaul the Renewable Fuel Standard in Congress.\n\nIn a letter to the Renewable Fuels Association this month, Trump highlighted that regulations are hurting ethanol producers.", "date": "2017-02-28 00:00:00", "title": "Trump Said to Consider Biofuel Plan Between Icahn, Ethanol Group"}

That night, over drinks at Chicago\u2019s Soho House, they came up with an ad concept that would use Snap\u2019s video filter to let people virtually dunk themselves in Gatorade after a big game -- taking to the masses a tradition typically reserved for players.\n\nThe project was classic Snap. Khan persuaded a brand to do something it had never done before, fully customized for Snapchat, and quickly. The sponsored lens, which let users superimpose the digital dunking effect over a selfie, was ready for the Super Bowl just a few months later; Khan attended the game as Mitchell\u2019s guest. The ad was widely praised by trade publications and reprised for this year\u2019s game. Apple\u2019s Beats brand, L\u2019Oreal and Taco Bell have all green-lighted similar gimmicks.\n\nNow, with Snap going public, a crucial question looms: Will big brands devote a sizable chunk of their marketing budgets to the disappearing-photo app -- or continue to see Snap mostly as a place for gauzy one-off experiments? Snap currently generates almost all of its $404 million in revenue from advertising. The growth potential of that business is what will draw investors to the initial public offering, which is set to price today.\n\nWhile Snap has built the advertising business up from nothing in about two years and created tools to target and measure audiences, advertisers say the ad-buying process remains overly complicated. They also note that Snap appeals to a narrower demographic -- teens and twenty-somethings -- than such rivals as Facebook. Finally, Khan, who hails from Wall Street, has had a big learning curve running the ad business.\n\n\u201cTheir maturation is going to be really based on how well they can deliver against some of the same metrics as Facebook and YouTube are measured against,\u201d says Mitchell, who is Gatorade\u2019s head of consumer engagement.\n\nSnap declined to comment, citing the standard pre-IPO quiet period.\n\nSnap\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel has long insisted that ads must not clunk up the user experience. As a result, Snap mostly sells 10-second video ads that are shot vertically so they can be viewed when holding a smartphone upright. As such, they don\u2019t conform to the standards for the horizontal, 30-second spots you see on television. That means brands have to make two versions of the same ad if they want to show it on Snap and on TV. Meanwhile, sponsored lenses like the Gatorade ad are unconventional and pricey, costing as much as $750,000 apiece to buy, according to advertisers.\n\nThen there\u2019s the ad-buying process. Right now, much of Snapchat\u2019s ad inventory is sold directly through sales representatives. By contrast, many of Snap\u2019s competitors sell without a middleman, through their websites or an automatic bidding system. Snap last year cut a deal with Viacom to help sell its ads and opened up an API (application programming interface) that lets brands buy and measure ads in real time. But the efforts are nascent; the API opened broadly just in January.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the first player really willing to experiment,\u201d says Tom Buontempo, president of marketing firm KBS Attention, who has worked with the likes of BMW, Intel and American Express. \u201cBut as you go public, you have to balance that against a steady revenue stream.\u201d If only Snap made it easier for his clients to buy their ads, it would \u201cmake it a lot easier to drive profitable growth.\u201d\n\nSnap may not have to conform to industry standards if it gets big enough. Facebook and Google both weathered industry pushback in their early days, with many suggesting those sites put up flashier banner ads to make more money.\n\nAt the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona today, Martin Sorrell, the CEO of ad giant WPP, told attendees his firm spent $90 million on Snap ads last year, accounting for almost a quarter of the app\u2019s revenue. \u201cThe biggest thing that Evan and his colleagues have got to do is demonstrate a return on investment,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Snap is far from generating granular, Facebook-caliber user data, it can provide information like age, gender, location, device and carrier. Snap is better able to verify how long a user watched an ad and what actions they took. A recent update lets advertisers target users by more than 100 interests, based on content they watch on the app\u2019s media channels. Brands can also target people based on their email lists or offline purchases.\n\nThe evangelist for the business is Khan, a former investment banker and an unlikely character to be driving the company\u2019s ad strategy. He joined in 2014 after helping run Alibaba\u2019s IPO at Credit Suisse. At Snap, Khan helps to handle almost everything besides product, from recruiting to sales to the IPO.\n\nHis colleagues and advertising contacts describe him as intensely focused on numbers and tasks to improve growth and not beholden to the ad industry\u2019s ways of doing things. He\u2019s tracked his salespeople with a leaderboard and asked advertisers to sign non-disclosure agreements to keep product news from leaking, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nTo some, Khan\u2019s transactional style is a departure from how it has traditionally worked on Madison Avenue, where deals are built on decades-long relationships. Others find the approach refreshing.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care how it was done before or how people have thought about it historically,\u201d says Jonah Goodhart, the CEO of advertising analytics startup Moat, who Khan sought out for a partnership to measure video ads. \u201cAnd a lot of people in our industry depend on how things have worked historically.\u201d\n\nDavid Cohen, the North America president of Magna Global, says Khan has quickly learned how to speak the language of the industry and understand what marketers want. \u201cA year ago he wouldn\u2019t have been someone who I would have thought would be chief strategic officer of Snapchat,\u201d says Cohen, who says he\u2019s coached Khan personally. \u201cI think he has gotten a very quick lesson in marketing and media,\u201d even if he\u2019s still \u201ca banker at heart.\u201d\n\nKhan has adopted some traditional industry tactics. He hired an industry veteran, Viacom\u2019s Jeff Lucas, to lead its global sales and improve upon advertiser relationships. Snap is also building an agency relations team. Previously a Snap sales team focused on a specific industry; soon ad buyers that deal with many kinds of advertisers will be able to talk to one person. Snap\u2019s sales and marketing expenses more than doubled in 2016, to $124 million -- mostly related to personnel expenses as the company boosts its sales force.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nDespite the progress, Cohen says Snap isn\u2019t yet a regular part of his advertiser budgets. He mentions the same problems cited by other advertisers, including the fact that the format is unusual. What\u2019s more, Snap\u2019s 158 million daily active users are a fraction of Facebook\u2019s, and user growth slowed in the fourth quarter. \u201cThere\u2019s still a perception that it\u2019s a youth millennial brand,\u201d Cohen says. \u201cI don\u2019t put them in the same bucket as I would put a Facebook or a Twitter.\u201d\n\nStill, with the regular improvements, he expects he\u2019ll have reason to spend more money on Snapchat this year.", "date": "2017-03-01 00:00:00", "title": "Can Snapchat Show Advertisers It's More Than a Place to Experiment?"}

But by saying it refuses to even discuss the kind of tariffs President Donald Trump has long trumpeted, the country is ratcheting up the pressure on U.S. negotiators and effectively daring them to pull out of the 23-year-old pact.\n\nGuajardo discusses renegotiating Nafta. (Source: Bloomberg)\n\nTrump has lambasted the accord -- which also includes Canada -- as unfair and responsible for a \u201cmassive\u201d imbalance favoring Mexico. It last year shipped $294 billion worth of goods north while the U.S. sent $231 billion south.\n\nMexican officials have said they expect official talks to start in June. And if they fail? \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be an absolute crisis,\u201d said Guajardo, who headed the Nafta office of the Mexican embassy in the U.S. in the early 90s, when the pact was being written and implemented.\n\nWithout Nafta, trade between Mexico and the U.S. would be ruled by World Trade Organization strictures limiting tariffs either country can impose on the other, with the average for Mexico at around 3 percent, according to the Mexico City-based political-risk advisory firm Empra. That \u201cwould take away some of our margin of competitiveness,\u201d the minister said, but would be manageable.\n\nOne thing that could help mitigate the impact of Nafta\u2019s end is the tumble in the peso. It\u2019s plunged 8 percent against the dollar over the past year, extending its slump since early 2013 to 35 percent.\n\nTariff Talk\n\nAs things stand now, most products go back and forth duty free; automobiles, televisions sets and some other goods have to contain a certain amount of content sourced in North America to get full Nafta benefits. But there\u2019s been a lot of talk in Washington about taxing imports.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer in January floated the idea of a 20 percent levy on goods from Mexico to pay for a border wall. That trial balloon went up after Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto canceled a trip to the American capital in response to Trump\u2019s repeating a campaign pledge about charging Mexico for the cost of building the wall.\n\nSome Republicans in Congress have called for what they refer to as a border-adjustment tax, affecting all countries, to help finance cuts in the corporate income tax. During the campaign, Trump was a fan of a 35 percent tax on auto imports from Mexico.\n\nGuajardo said part of the reason his country is unwilling to consider any new Nafta duties is because of a possible domino effect. \u201cOpening the door to tariffs is very dangerous, because it\u2019s like opening Pandora\u2019s box -- the lines of people asking for protectionism in Washington would reach to Maryland, and in Mexico City they\u2019d reach to Puebla.\u201d\n\n\u2018Very High Potential\u2019\n\nThe border-adjustment tax, he said, is something that\u2019s squarely a domestic fiscal matter for the U.S. He also said it would be complicated to implement, and would no doubt result in mirror changes from other nations that would aim to level the playing field. Washington\u2019s going that route \u201cwould require a crazy amount of control on the origin of merchandise and inputs.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. is by far Mexico\u2019s biggest single trading partner. But Mexico has pacts with more than 40 other countries, and has been accelerating free-trade talks with Brazil and Argentina after changes in those nations\u2019 governments have them looking more favorably on open markets.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nIn Brazil in particular, Mexico sees what Guajardo called \u201cvery, very high potential\u201d in areas including automobiles. \u201cI\u2019m not going to negotiate with Brazil for its pretty face. I\u2019m going to negotiate with Brazil because they\u2019re going to open their car-manufacturing market,\u201d said the minister, who has overseen negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership and is working to update the country\u2019s free-trade agreement with the European Union.\n\nMexico is also seeking to have TPP members join the Pacific Alliance, which includes Chile, Peru and Colombia. TPP nations have been invited to participate in the Latin American group\u2019s meeting in March, Guajardo said. In one of his first acts as president, Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Pacific trade deal, designed to knit together almost 40 percent of the global economy.\n\nFor all his tough talk, Guajardo was optimistic the U.S., Mexico and Canada could come to terms on revamping Nafta. \u201cI think there is a way to find a very good agreement that will be a win-win for the three countries,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said appropriate ways to improve and update Nafta would be to add digital commerce, telecommunications and aspects of the energy industry that weren\u2019t included when the deal was first negotiated. He also suggested that the requirements for the amount of North American content that goes into products that trade duty free could also be strengthened.\n\nWhile Trump has called Nafta the worst trade deal ever, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week that he\u2019s not worried about trade relations with Mexico and also sees a \u201cwin-win\u201d result that can come out of Nafta talks.\n\nGuajardo said he wants talks to wrap up early in 2018. Otherwise, \u201cwe\u2019d be irresponsibly injecting uncertainty after uncertainty because of the U.S. mid-term election and the presidential election in Mexico.\u201d Mexicans go to the polls to choose a president in July 2018, and the U.S. mid-terms are that November.", "date": "2017-02-27 00:00:00", "title": "Mexico Warns U.S. It'll Cut Off Nafta Talks If Tariffs Added"}

The tall, swaggering engineer was featured in a long New Yorker story about the search engine willing the impossible technology into reality.\n\nLess than four years later, he is Google's enemy number one.\n\nOn Thursday, Waymo, the Alphabet Inc. company formed from Google's self-driving project, filed a blistering lawsuit accusing Levandowski of taking incredibly valuable intellectual property from Alphabet to his current company, Uber Technologies Inc.\n\nAnthony Levandowski. Photographer: Angelo Merendino/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWaymo's lawsuit hinges on a series of alleged moves from Levandowski in the days leading up to his departure from Alphabet in January 2016. His web searches, downloads and access to an external drive left behind digital footprints. When exposed, they were closely scrutinized by his former employer --which is now citing them as central to its lawsuit, a rare intellectual property claim from Alphabet.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Uber called Waymo's suit \"baseless\" and said the company plans to combat it legally. \"We have reviewed Waymo's claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court,\" an Uber spokeswoman said.\n\nThe legal case also deepens a growing rift between the two companies, which are becoming bitter rivals in mapping, autonomous vehicles and -- potentially -- Uber's core business of ride-hailing services.\n\nAt the center of it all is the six foot seven Levandowski\n\nThe prodigious engineer has spent much of his career chasing a dream of placing robotic cars on the road. While at the University of California at Berkeley, he entered a self-driving motorcycle in the 2004 DARPA Grand Challenge, a historic event for the young field.\n\nHe also started 510 Systems, a robotics firm building lasers for autonomous vehicles. The startup once ran a stunt with a self-driving pizza car. Levandowski started at Google in 2007, working on its Street View unit, where he played an instrumental role in building its mapping hardware to fit on cars.\n\nAfter being recruited to its secretive car project, he continued to work on 510 Systems, according to two people familiar with the situation. Google eventually acquired the startup as it pushed deeper into self-driving technology.\n\nYears later, Waymo would detail how Levandowski had secretly plotted his next startup, Otto, while also working for Google. Uber acquired Otto in August for $680 million.\n\nAccording to Waymo's suit, Levandowski installed \"specialized software\" on his corporate laptop, in December 2015, loading it with 14,000 confidential files about lidar technology, vital to autonomous driving. \"Levandowski took extraordinary efforts to raid Waymo\u2019s design server and then conceal his activities,\" the suit reads.\n\nRaw data from Velodyne's HDL-64E LiDAR sensor. Source: Velodyne LiDAR\n\nIn January of last year, he began telling Alphabet colleagues about plans to \"replicate\" its technology at a competitor. The suit says he visited Uber's San Francisco headquarters on January 14, 2016 and the next day he formed a company that would become Otto.\n\nLess than two weeks later, he resigned from Alphabet without notice.\n\nAlphabet's lawsuit comes after a wave of significant departures from its car unit, which has still not delivered a commercial service despite years of work.\n\nSome workers may have had additional impetus to leave. At the onset of its car project, Google set up a pay system that would reward early employees greatly upon departure, as Bloomberg News reported earlier. \"Notably,\" Waymo's lawsuit reads, \"Otto announced the acquisition [by Uber] shortly after Mr. Levandowski received his final multi-million dollar compensation payment from Google.\"\n\nLevandowski was among the first to exit. He didn't respond to phone calls seeking comment.\n\n\n\n``We did not steal any Google IP,'' Levandowski told Forbes last year in comments that were republished Thursday. ``Just want to make sure, super clear on that. We built everything from scratch and we have all of the logs to make that\u2014just to be super clear.''\n\n\n\nUber placed him atop their nascent autonomous vehicle efforts in July. The next month the company unveiled plans to bring self-driving cars to Pittsburgh.\n\n\n\nWaymo's suit caps a horrendous week for Uber, which is reeling from damning public charges of sexual harassment in its ranks. The company's culture has been slammed and Eric Holder, a former U.S. attorney general, has been hired to investigate.\n\n\n\nFormer Google colleagues described Levandowski as \"very driven,\" with a personality similar to Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick.\n\n\n\nThat's a comparison Kalanick made himself when he announced the acquisition of Otto.\n\n\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019re brothers from another mother,\" he said at the time.", "date": "2017-02-24 00:00:00", "title": "Ambitious Engineer at Center of Colossal Fight Between Google and Uber"}

But that was before Congress approved a $10.1 billion sale to Kuwait, Canada said it would take 18 of the twin-engine fighter and Trump said the Pentagon is \u201clooking seriously at a big order.\u201d\n\nF/A-18 Super Hornet Source: Boeing Co.\n\nNow Dan Gillian, who heads the Boeing fighter-jet program, is plotting upgrades to keep the F/A-18 flying through the 2040s -- and even looking at increasing the production rate. The U.S. Navy may need at least 100 of the Super Hornets over the next five years while it waits for Lockheed\u2019s next version of the F-35. Boeing also sees opportunities for additional sales from India, Finland and Switzerland.\n\n\u201cWe have reinvented this factory four or five times,\u201d Gillian said during a recent February morning stroll through the Super Hornet\u2019s final assembly line. In the background, a jet\u2019s nose barrel was being riveted together. Now the company is studying how to boost output while keeping operations lean, \u201cwhich is a great problem to solve,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest resurgence for a combat jet that took its first flight in 1995 and seemed headed for oblivion in 2001 when Lockheed\u2019s F-35 beat a Boeing proposal to build the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Strike Fighter. The Super Hornet found a lifeline as cost overruns and technical issues plagued early development of the F-35, the first jet designed to meet the different missions of the Marines, Air Force and Navy.\n\nSurvival Recipe\n\nThe flurry of Super Hornet sales and a $21.1 billion order by Qatar for Boeing\u2019s F-15 fighter have helped revive the Chicago-based company\u2019s defense business as commercial-jet orders start to lag. The military business was Boeing\u2019s largest at the start of the decade. It accounted for only 31 percent of total revenue last year due to the Obama administration\u2019s spending constraints.\n\nThe Navy has relied heavily on the Super Hornet, whose combat credentials were burnished in missions over Iraq and Afghanistan, while awaiting a stealth-fighter version developed for aircraft-carrier decks: the F-35C. The final model of Lockheed\u2019s three-jet family isn\u2019t slated to be declared combat-ready before late 2018, and it could take more than a decade for the 260 jets ordered by the Navy and 80 by the Marines to be delivered.\n\n\u201cAll of this is a recipe for survival into the mid-2020s,\u201d Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group, said of Boeing. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t expected a few years ago.\u201d\n\nPentagon Study\n\nHow swiftly Boeing moves to step up production -- and hiring in St. Louis -- could depend on a Pentagon study comparing the operational capabilities of the Super Hornet, which was designed in the 1990s, with the cutting-edge F-35.\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis commissioned the study during the new president\u2019s first week in office, after Trump had suggested on Twitter that an upgraded version of the F/A-18 could be an alternative to the Lockheed fighter. The president has repeatedly criticized the $379 billion F-35 program as \u201cout of control.\u201d\n\nLockheed welcomes the \u201cappropriate focus on affordability and capability,\u201d Marillyn Hewson, the defense company\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a statement. \u201cWe are confident such a thorough and objective analysis will show that only the F-35, with its advanced stealth and sensors, can meet the 21st century air superiority requirements of all of our military services.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the Mattis study, Boeing appears poised to reap as many as 140 Super Hornet orders between 2017 and 2022 as the Pentagon addresses its strike-fighter shortfall, said defense analyst Jim McAleese.\n\nBoeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg has made the Super Hornet a focus of discussions as he cultivates a relationship with Trump. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, was spotted holding a brochure for the next version of the jet, the F/A-18 XT, while Trump toured a Boeing commercial jet factory last week. During an address to workers, the president hinted that a large order was ahead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to work with the new administration to bring the right capability to the warfighter, and it has certainly accelerated that discussion,\u201d Gillian, the Boeing vice president, said.\n\nNot Stealthier\n\nBoeing has floated concepts for an enhanced Super Hornet for several years, though based on Navy feedback, the company has focused on relatively cheap upgrades. The latest version would extend the fighter\u2019s range, while upgrading cockpit displays with larger screens. Boeing and General Electric Co. are also studying an engine redesign that could boost thrust from the Super Hornet turbines by about 20 percent.\n\nThe jet would be made \u201csmarter\u201d by borrowing both the bigger network switches and a distributed-network processor developed for the EA-18G Growler, a sibling designed to jam enemy radar. But it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be stealthier. Boeing has dropped plans to encase the Super Hornet\u2019s weapons systems in a pod aimed at reducing its radar footprint, Gillian said.\n\n\u201cThere is no point in trying to compete with an F-35 on stealth,\u201d said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst with Lexington Institute, who\u2019s done consulting for contractors such as Lockheed. \u201cBut there are other things like networking where the Super Hornet can deliver capabilities earlier than the F-35.\u201d\n\nExtending Lives\n\nThe upgrades would cost \u201ca couple of million dollars\u201d above the \u201clow-to-mid $70 million\u201d price that the Navy currently pays for the Super Hornet, according to Gillian. They could also be retrofitted to older models. Boeing holds a separate contract worth about $2 billion aimed at extending the lives of the 568 Super Hornets already in the Navy fleet by one-third to 9,000 flight hours.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world.

The fighters are vastly different, with distinctive roles in America\u2019s arsenal, said Representative Kay Granger, the Republican lawmaker who would need to approve big changes in defense spending.\n\nSo, Boeing\u2019s fighter orders shouldn\u2019t come at Lockheed\u2019s expense if caps on defense spending are lifted, Thompson said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s frankly what the Navy needs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs to get a fully stealthy aircraft on its carrier decks.

The U.S. imposed new sanctions on Iran after it carried out a ballistic missile test. There\u2019s history here. As a candidate, Trump condemned the 2015 nuclear accord -- which eased economic sanctions in exchange for limits on Iran\u2019s nuclear program -- as a \u201cdisaster\u201d for offering too many concessions to a longtime foe.\n\n1. What triggered the escalation?\n\nThe missile test confirmed by Tehran on Feb. 1 was the fifth since the 2015 agreement between Iran and world powers. But it was the first since Trump took office, and he chose an aggressive response. \"As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice,\" said his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, a warning Trump hammered home with a Twitter message.\n\nIran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile.Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017\n\n2. Why is Iran launching missiles?\n\nIt says missile tests are a sovereign right and part of a legitimate defense program. But since its latest one came just days after Trump included Iran in a list of seven Muslim-majority nations whose citizens are barred from entering the U.S., there\u2019s the question of whether the launch was an Iranian reaction to a perceived U.S. provocation.\n\n3. Did the missile test violate a UN resolution?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell, since there\u2019s disagreement on the resolution\u2019s meaning. In UN Security Council Resolution 2231, Iran \"is called upon not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons\" for eight years. Iran says it neither holds nuclear weapons nor intends to develop them, so it\u2019s free to carry out tests. The U.S. sees it differently. Flynn said the Jan. 29 test was \u201cthe latest of a series of incidents\u201d in which Iran continues \u201cto threaten U.S. friends and allies in the region\u201d and was \u201cin defiance\u201d of the Security Council.\n\n4. What new sanctions did the U.S. impose?\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department published a list of 13 individuals and 12 entities facing new restrictions, citing some for contributing to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and others for links to terrorism. They add to a tangle of sanctions the U.S. already imposes on Iran for its support for terrorism, human rights abuses, and its missile and advanced conventional weapons programs. The new sanctions aren\u2019t directed at Iran\u2019s nuclear program and wouldn\u2019t directly affect its 2015 agreement with world powers.\n\nIran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a life-line in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017\n\n5. How has Iran responded?\n\nBefore the specific sanctions were announced, Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan said in comments published by local news agency Tasnim that Iran had urged the U.S. not to overreact to its missile tests. President Hassan Rouhani, the architect of the nuclear deal, and his inner circle are expected to measure their responses to Trump to avoid inflaming tensions. But that won\u2019t stop hardliners from speaking out. At Friday prayers in Tehran, Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami called the missile test \"a show of our power\" and lambasted \"the arrogant U.S. government.\"\n\n6. What might happen next?\n\nKeep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily.\n\nA more contentious tone from Washington is likely to scare investors away from Iran, which already complains that existing sanctions are having that effect. That could damage re-election prospects for Rouhani, who in May will be challenged by hardliners opposed to relations with the U.S. If the White House seeks Iran\u2019s capitulation through economic pressure or the threat (or use) of military force, there could be \u201can explosive downward spiral,\u201d said Ali Vaez, senior Iran analyst at International Crisis Group.\n\n7. Is Iran keeping its side of the nuclear bargain?\n\nIt largely is, according to international monitors. Under the deal, Iran retains the ability to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes. But it eliminated its stockpile of 20 percent-enriched uranium, which can be used to make medical isotopes and to power research reactors, but also could also be purified to weapons-grade at short notice. It also mothballed thousands of centrifuges and halted activity at Fordow, an enrichment site deep underground. Four International Atomic Energy Agency assessments since the deal took effect in January 2016 found Iran sticking to its obligations. In October, Iran did slightly surpass a limit on heavy water stocks it though it addressed that within weeks by shipping the surplus to Oman.\n\nThe Reference Shelf", "date": "2017-02-02 00:00:00", "title": "What\u2019s Next in Trump\u2019s Escalating Row With Iran: QuickTake Q&A"}

Even as the U.S., Canada and Mexico were finalizing the deal in 1992, Ross Perot warned of a \"giant sucking sound\" that would drag American jobs into the land of the peso. Now President Donald Trump, in some ways the inheritor of Perot\u2019s insurgent political movement, vows to get the deal rewritten, or else. Exactly what changes he seeks is as yet unclear. So is whether Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto will open talks as long as Trump promises a border wall built on his nation\u2019s tab.\n\n1. What does the U.S. want?\n\nTrump has derided Nafta as the \"single worst trade deal\" in U.S. history but has been light on specifics. He told reporters on Monday that the U.S. will be \"tweaking\" the deal with relation to Canada but will seek to remedy \"an extremely unfair\" trade relationship with Mexico, pledging to strike \"a fair deal for both parties.\" He\u2019s said that renegotiation should begin with immigration and border security, though those are peripheral issues to the agreement. His biggest concern seems to be the shift of jobs, especially in the auto industry, to south of the border. He\u2019s threatened a 35 percent tax on General Motors Co. and Toyota Motor Corp\u2019s imports, which would be barred under Nafta as currently written but would make moving jobs to Mexico less profitable for companies.\n\n2. What does Mexico want?\n\nMostly, Trump\u2019s message has been met with calls to preserve the virtually tariff-free trading under Nafta. Plus Mexico wants no part of a border wall, much less the bill for one.\n\n3. Can Trump pull the U.S. from Nafta?\n\n\n\nYes, by invoking Article 2205 of the agreement, which requires six months\u2019 written notice to the other parties.\n\n4. What would happen then?\n\nU.S. tariff levels for Mexico would revert to those dictated by most-favored-nation status at the World Trade Organization -- assuming Trump doesn\u2019t pull out of that as well. That tariff on Mexican goods might be small enough to be offset by the peso\u2019s recent depreciation. For the U.S. and Canada, they would go back to the levels agreed to in a bilateral trade deal that took effect in 1989. Trump could raise tariffs temporarily by citing the Trade Act of 1974, but such an action probably would provoke an immediate challenge by Mexico or Canada at the WTO.\n\n5. Is Trump likely to withdraw?\n\nProbably not. Withdrawing could upset supply chains in the deeply integrated North American economy, resulting in a loss of U.S. jobs and higher costs for American consumers. It\u2019s more likely Trump is using the threat of withdrawal as a ploy to make Mexico and Canada give up more in a Nafta renegotiation.\n\n6. Would changes need legislative approval?\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nProbably yes, which could pose a problem in the U.S. While past presidential administrations have negotiated minor adjustments on their own, the U.S. Congress has been advised that \"major changes\" can be made only with its assent. Nafta barely passed Congress in 1993 in a much less contentious environment for trade and required a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, to corral Republican House votes. Trump has one advantage: fast-track authority granted by Congress in 2015, which he could use to submit a renegotiated pact to Congress for an expedited, up-or-down vote without amendments.\n\n7. Could Mexico pull out of Nafta?\n\nTheoretically, yes. But only if the Trump administration makes the terms of Nafta so arduous that they would hurt the nation\u2019s interests would Mexico pulling out become a likely option, said Francisco de Rosenzweig, the nation\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiator, who left the government last year and now works for the law firm White & Case.\n\n8. Where do U.S.-Mexico relations go from here?\n\nTensions between the two nations haven\u2019t been this high since the 1920s and 1930s, when U.S. President Calvin Coolidge threatened to invade Mexico, which later expropriated U.S. oil assets. Though Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto have left the door open to meet at a later date, it\u2019s unclear if they ever will as long as Trump demands Mexico agree to pay for a border wall.\n\n9. Where does Canada fit in?\n\nCanada\u2019s relatively balanced trade with the U.S. means it\u2019s likely be a spectator to the U.S.-Mexico showdown, and Canadian officials mostly worry about collateral damage Trump adviser Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone Group LP flew to Calgary to reassure Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that Canada isn\u2019t a primary target.\n\nThe Reference Shelf\n\n", "date": "2017-01-26 00:00:00", "title": "How Trump\u2019s Wall Makes Nafta Talks Even Thornier: QuickTake Q&A"}

He told reporters that there is fraud in some polling locations and so the nominee will \u201ctake a wait-and-see approach.\u201d\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s allies also tried to frame his refusal to say he would concede by suggesting it won\u2019t matter, because he\u2019ll win or that a challenge to the results may be required.\n\nTrump\u2019s Allies\n\nSenator Jeff Sessions of Alabama told reporters that Trump will accept the results \u201cif they\u2019re fair and he\u2019s had the opportunity to challenge them if need be.\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said he thinks there can be widespread voter fraud and Trump \u201cisn\u2019t willing to carte blanche concede it isn\u2019t possible.\u201d Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, the party\u2019s 2008 vice presidential nominee, said she has no reason to believe the election is rigged.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say the election is rigged because it hasn\u2019t taken place yet, but let us hope that these are legitimate votes taken and of course the results will be accepted,\u201d said Palin, who endorsed Trump during the primary race. \u201cWe\u2019ll live with it if it\u2019s legit.\u201d\n\n\u2018Great Disservice\u2019\n\nOther Republicans expressed alarm. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Trump is doing the party and the country \u201ca great disservice\u201d by suggesting the outcome of the election is out of his hands. \u201cIf he loses, it will not be because the system is \u2018rigged\u2019 but because he failed as a candidate,\u201d Graham said on Twitter.\n\nArizona Senator Jeff Flake, a vehement Trump opponent, called Trump\u2019s assertion \u201cbeyond the pale.\u201d\n\nWith 19 days left in the campaign, the nominees are scheduled to be in the same room just one more time before the election, at Thursday night\u2019s annual Al Smith charity dinner in New York.\n\nKeep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily.\n\nThe debate, moderated by Chris Wallace of Fox News, came after a tumultuous few weeks for Trump. His slide in state and national polls started with a lackluster performance in the first debate on Sept. 26 and continued with the release of a 2005 recording of Trump making lewd comments about women and subsequent allegations from several women that he inappropriately touched them. Trump denied those allegations.\n\nSubstantive Issues\n\nAt the start of the debate, the candidates offered sharply differing views on the Supreme Court, gun control, and abortion. Although much of the debate dealt with substantive issues, it quickly got personal and combative when it turned to women\u2019s groping accusations against Trump and to questions of whether he tolerated Russia\u2019s interference in the U.S. election.\n\nThe candidates repeatedly talked over each other, with Trump interjecting \u201cwrong\u201d several times as Clinton spoke. At one point, as she made a jab about his taxes while talking about the Social Security Trust Fund, he proclaimed: \u201cSuch a nasty woman.\u201d\n\nTrump accused Clinton of pushing the stories of the women who came forward to allege sexual misconduct, and he again denied behaving inappropriately.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even apologize to my wife, who\u2019s sitting right here, because I didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Trump said. Of his accusers, he said, \u201cI think they want either fame or her campaign did it.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s Criticism\n\nClinton criticized Trump over the allegations and his general treatment of women, a voting bloc that has been central to her lead in the polls.\n\n\u201cDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cHe goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don\u2019t think there is a woman anywhere who doesn\u2019t know what that feels like.\u201d\n\nA snap poll conducted immediately after the debate by CNN found 52 percent of registered voters who watched thought Clinton won, compared with 39 percent who said Trump was the winner. Mexico\u2019s peso traded in line with emerging-market peers after the debate, signaling traders saw nothing that changed their view of who is likely to win the election.\n\nThe candidates also clashed over Russia and the hacking of Democratic Party e-mails that U.S. officials have blamed on President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government.\n\nClinton deflected questions about the leaking of hacked e-mails from her campaign by criticizing Trump for failing to denounce Russian interference in the U.S. election. Trump shot back by saying the U.S. has no idea who was behind the hacking.\n\nPutin\u2019s Role\n\n\u201cHillary, you have no idea,\u201d he said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly praised Putin as a strong leader and refused to put the blame on Russia for hacking Democratic Party and Clinton campaign files even though U.S. security and intelligence officials have done so. \u201cI\u2019ve never met Putin. This is not my best friend, but if the United States got along with Russia it wouldn\u2019t be so bad.\u201d\n\nClinton suggested that Putin prefers Trump because \u201che\u2019d rather have a puppet as president.\u201d\n\nWallace asked Clinton whether she kept the pledge during her 2009 confirmation hearing as secretary of state to avoid any conflict of interest with the Clinton Foundation, especially with questions about whether those seeking grants involving Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors.\n\nClinton said everything she did as secretary of state was proper, and the foundation was a \u201cworld-renowned charity.\u201d Trump called it \u201ca criminal enterprise.\u201d\n\nSupreme Court\n\nThe candidates agreed that the Supreme Court is one of the central issues in the campaign, one that both parties have used to motivate voters to get to the polls on Election Day. Trump said he would support seeing the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that made abortion legal overturned.\n\n\u201cThat will happen,\u201d he said, noting the type of \u201cpro-life\u201d justices that he would plan to appoint. \u201cIt will go back to the states and then the states will make the determination.\u201d\n\nClinton gave an emotional defense of her stance on allowing termination of pregnancies late-term, citing forced abortions in China and other practices that she saw while secretary of state.\n\nOne of their most vigorous clashes came over immigration and trade, although neither candidate offered any new details on their plans.\n\nThe fight over immigration policy has been a central issue in the race, with Trump arguing for construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and demanding that Mexico pay for it. He\u2019s also vowed to increase deportations. \u201cWe have some bad hombres here, and we\u2019re going to get them out.\u201d\n\nClinton and others have questioned the feasibility of that proposal and she\u2019s promised to introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within her first 100 days in office. Clinton said Trump\u2019s plan to deport all undocumented immigrants is not in keeping with the nation\u2019s ideals and would \u201crip our country apart.\u201d\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to rip families apart,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action.\u201d\n\nThe two also battled over their tax and spending plans, with Clinton saying she wanted to see the \u201cbiggest jobs program since World War II.\u201d Trump pointed to former President Bill Clinton, as he presented himself as an expert negotiator.\n\n\u201cOur jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed,\u201d Trump said in a reference to the North American Free Trade Agreement. \u201cI\u2019m going to renegotiate NAFTA.\u201d\n\nWhile Clinton has said her proposals wouldn\u2019t add to the federal debt, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated they would likely add $200 billion to the debt during the next decade, while Trump\u2019s policies would add $5.3 trillion.\n\nTrump said that while Clinton has an advantage of governmental experience, she\u2019s not used it effectively. \u201cShe\u2019s been doing this for 30 years. Why the hell didn\u2019t you do it over the last 15, 20 years?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe one thing you have over me is experience, but it\u2019s bad experience.\u201d", "date": "2016-10-20 00:00:00", "title": "Trump Refuses to Say He\u2019ll Accept Election Results If He Loses"}

Uber's chief executive officer, at times with tears in his eyes, apologized for a lack of diversity in the company's workforce and for not properly responding to employee complaints, while those in attendance lobbed tough, pointed questions, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. After a rough start to the year, employee morale is bleak, one of the people said.\n\n\"Travis spoke very honestly about the mistakes he\u2019s made\u2014and about how he wants to take the events of the last 48-hours to build a better Uber,\" Huffington wrote in a company blog post. \"Change doesn\u2019t usually happen without a catalyst. I hope that by taking the time to understand what\u2019s gone wrong and fixing it we can not only make Uber better but also contribute to improvements for women across the industry.\"\n\nIn its almost eight-year history, Uber has been buffeted by near-constant controversy. Kalanick's public statements over the years have helped established the company's combative reputation. But this year has already become one of the startup's most tumultuous periods. Last month, the #deleteuber movement came about after customers accused Uber of breaking a New York taxi drivers' strike and allying itself with President Donald Trump. Kalanick hosted a similar wrenching all-hands meeting amid the #deleteuber controversy. He said he opposed Trump's refugee ban and later stepped down from the president's business advisory council.\n\nThen this past weekend, former software developer Susan Fowler wrote a blog post alleging that she'd been sexually harassed during her year at Uber and that the company's HR department had tried to protect her manager, rather than resolve the situation.\n\n\u201cIt was clear that he was trying to get me to have sex with him, and it was so clearly out of line that I immediately took screenshots of these chat messages and reported him to HR,\u201d Fowler wrote. She said she was told by senior managers that he was a \u201chigh performer\u201d and that they didn\u2019t want to punish him for what they considered an \u201cinnocent mistake.\u201d\n\nIn Tuesday's meeting, Kalanick told the gathered crowd that he'd work on improving as a leader. It provided him with a chance to show employees his resolve in righting the ship.\n\n\"If the world, and Uber specifically, takes one thing away from this, it should be that this is not an isolated incident,\" Aimee Lucido, a software engineer at Uber, wrote in a personal blog post. \"I think this is disgusting and appalling and horrifying and yet I am not surprised at all. In fact, I\u2019m most surprised at how surprised everyone else seems to be.\"\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is working with Uber to lead an investigation into Fowler's allegations. Kalanick wrote in an e-mail to employees Monday that Holder and Tammy Albarran, a partner at the law firm Covington & Burling along with Holder, \"will conduct an independent review into the specific issues relating to the work place environment raised by Susan Fowler, as well as diversity and inclusion at Uber more broadly.\" Liane Hornsey, who joined in January as the company's HR head, will participate in the inquiry, as well as Huffington and Angela Padilla, the associate general counsel.\n\nUber's public perception is marred by allegations of misogyny and an unwelcoming culture. In a February 2014 GQ profile, Kalanick said people referred to the company as \"Boob-er\" because it helped him attract women. A few months later, Uber employees in France offered riders a chance to be driven by \"sexy girls.\"\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nLater that same year, Uber showed that it could track its users locations in \"God View.\" The next month, Uber's general manager in New York City told a reporter that he had been tracking her location on his phone. That same month, Uber executive Emil Michael suggested that the company could hire opposition researchers to look into critical reporters. Both remain at the company, and Michael is one of Kalanick's top lieutenants.\n\nUber had begun to turn a corner in the intervening years. Uber now has more than 11,000 employees, not including the company's drivers, who are independent contractors\u2014another source of contention.

Making use of independence from Europe\u2019s common currency, policy makers started printing koruna to buy euros and dollars in 2013, at one point driving the koruna about 6 percent weaker. The bank has since blocked the currency from strengthening past 27 against the euro to push more money into the economy. It\u2019s bought more than $24 billion worth of foreign currencies with newly created tender.\n\n1. How did we get here?\n\nLike their U.S. and euro-zone counterparts, Czech rate setters effectively ran out of room to lower interest rates after cutting their main cost of borrowing to 0.05 percent -- \"technical zero\" -- in 2012. When even that looked insufficient to stop inflation from turning negative -- deflation -- the central bank took a page from its Swiss counterpart and capped its currency in November 2013. The Czechs\u2019 top-flight credit rating and steady growth outlook prevented investor flight after the central bank knocked the koruna weaker and slapped a lid on how far the currency can strengthen.\n\n2. Has it worked?\n\nYes, according to the central bank. While inflation remains well below the bank\u2019s target range of 2 percent plus/minus one percentage point, it hasn\u2019t dipped below zero. Prices rose 0.1 percent compared with a year earlier in June, and policy makers see them edging back to within their goal in 2017. While making imports more expensive, the policy has made exports more competitive and prompted Czechs to buy more goods made at home, which the central bank lauds for driving one of Europe\u2019s fastest growth rates.\n\n3. How much longer will the cap stay?\n\nThe central bank wants to avoid having to impose a cap a second time, which could happen if it returns to conventional policy too soon. Still, with price growth seen accelerating at the end of 2016, it\u2019s forecasting that it may be able to remove the cap in mid-2017.\n\n4. What\u2019s the exit strategy?\n\nThe most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s to learn from the Swiss. Policy makers in Zurich abruptly abandoned their currency cap last year, shocking global markets and stinging investors with billions of dollars in losses. The Czechs want what Miroslav Singer, the former central bank governor who introduced the current system, called \u201ca more predictable and mainly non-volatile exit.\u201d Singer\u2019s replacement, Jiri Rusnok, prefers a one-off departure, vowing with his fellow rate-setters to prevent a wild surge once the bindings come off. That might include interventions to buy foreign currencies or, less likely, introducing negative interest rates.\n\n5. What does it mean for the market?\n\nForeign investors have shrugged off negative yields and piled into koruna-denominated bonds, doubling their ownership in the past two years. They\u2019re counting on a jump in the currency when the central bank dismantles the cap. The koruna regularly bumps against its 27 crown-per-euro ceiling, suggesting it will immediately strengthen when the cap is lifted. Analysts polled by Bloomberg see the koruna trading at 26.3 at the end of 2018, a gain of less than 3 percent from current levels.\n\nThe Reference Shelf", "date": "2016-08-02 00:00:00", "title": "QuickTake Q&A: Czechonomics 101, an Easy Way to Monetary Easing"}

Bush.\n\nHaley, 44, was always going to shift U.S. priorities at the UN given the policy differences between Trump and departing President Barack Obama. But that change was accentuated after the U.S.\u2019s abstention in the Security Council last month allowed passage of a resolution condemning Israel\u2019s settlements policy. That fueled bipartisan criticism in Congress and vows from Trump that change is coming with his administration Jan. 20.\n\nFor a QuickTake on U.S.-Israeli ties, click here\n\nThe UN has a \u201cbiased and ugly approach\u201d to Israel, exemplified by the \u201cone-sided\u201d resolution passed last month, Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, told Haley at her confirmation hearing Wednesday.\n\nHaley is widely expected to be confirmed for the UN post, despite her lack of experience in international diplomacy. She acknowledged the vote on Israel will affect her UN agenda, telling senators that the Security Council resolution was \u201ca terrible mistake, making a peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians even harder to achieve.\u201d\n\n\u201cNowhere has the UN\u2019s failure been more consistent and more outrageous than in its bias against our close ally Israel,\u201d she said.\n\nBecause U.S. interests at the UN go well beyond Israel -- there\u2019s the nuclear deal with Iran, efforts to stymie North Korea\u2019s weapons program, talks over the Syrian war and global peacekeeping operations, among others -- Haley needs to strike a balance in keeping Congress happy while building constructive relationships to pursue U.S. foreign policy interests.\n\nRussian Sanctions\n\nAs it has in other hearings for Trump\u2019s national security picks, Russia emerged as a flashpoint, with his nominees much less sanguine than the president-elect on the prospects for working with President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHaley said she believes U.S. sanctions against Russia for its annexation of Crimea need to remain until there is more \u201cpositive action\u201d from Putin\u2019s government. She added that since the election she and Trump have spoken only in a general fashion about the challenges the U.S. faces from Moscow.\n\n\u201cRussia is trying to show their muscle right now,\u201d Haley said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can trust them.\u201d\n\nYet Trump\u2019s efforts to work with Russia could help break a stalemate on the Security Council after relations soured during the Obama administration. From its military moves in Ukraine to its engagement in the Syrian war on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad, the collapse of U.S.-Russian relations effectively halted most work on the Security Council.\n\nIn the few tweets he\u2019s directed at the UN since winning election, Trump has expressed disappointment with how the global body functions.\n\n\u2018Just a Club\u2019\n\n\u201cThe United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad!,\u201d Trump wrote in a Twitter post Dec. 26.\n\nBeyond Israel and Russia, there are a range of issues that don\u2019t always dominate the spotlight but that constitute a significant part of the UN workload. Haley will be the U.S. point-person on UN efforts to address troubles in Africa from an Islamic insurgency in Mali to political unrest in South Sudan and democratic challenges in Gambia and Congo, where incumbent presidents are declining to step down.\n\nIn addition, Haley noted that UN peacekeepers have faced widespread allegations that they sexually abused citizens they were deployed to protect. The organization also saw its reputation stained after its troops introduced cholera to Haiti after the country\u2019s devastating 2010 earthquake. All that will be on Haley\u2019s plate as she forges a relationship with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres of Portugal, who succeeded South Korea\u2019s Ban Ki-moon this month.\n\nIsrael Focus\n\nNevertheless, Israel was a frequent topic at Haley\u2019s confirmation hearing. Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham have put forward legislation to cut off all UN funding until the Israeli vote, which passed 14-0, is reversed.\n\nHaley gave a nod, though not an explicit endorsement, to those efforts in her Wednesday testimony, saying her experience as governor taught her the importance of accountability when spending taxpayer money.\n\n\u201cTo your credit, the Congress has already begun to explore ways the United States can use its leverage to make the United Nations a better investment for the American people,\u201d Haley said. \u201cI applaud your efforts, and I look forward to working with you to bring seriously needed change to the UN.\u201d\n\nKeep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics.

The deal, which Trump has criticized, lifted nuclear-related sanctions against Iran in return for halting the country\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nEnsure Compliance\n\nAt this stage, it would be better for the U.S. to monitor the accord rather than withdraw from it unilaterally, Haley said. \u201cWhat would be more beneficial at this point is that we look at all the details of the Iran deal, we see if they are actually in compliance,\u201d Haley said. \u201cIf we find that there are violations that we act on those violations.\"\n\nAs for the congressional threat to withhold U.S. funds in order to punish the UN or to apply pressure for reform, Peter Yeo, a vice president of the nonprofit United Nations Foundation, said in an interview that could cause more harm than good.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. were to cut funding, those activities would still continue but in an underfunded way,\u201d Yeo said. \u201cBut it will undermine our influence because to get something done at the UN you need broad coalitions.\u201d", "date": "2017-01-18 00:00:00", "title": "Trump\u2019s UN Pick Will Relay Congress\u2019s Fury Over Israel Vote"}

As Russia poses the greatest espionage threat to the U.K., any new deal between Putin and Trump could call into question the safety of sharing British intelligence with the U.S., the officials said.\n\nOne U.K. official said the threat of a close relationship between the two was causing more concern within May\u2019s administration than planning for Brexit, and had been discussed at high levels in May\u2019s national security team.

One official said that if the new administration grows too close to Putin, it would raise alarms that British secrets could be passed to Moscow and jeopardize intelligence-sharing with the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe have seen over the last period the way in which Trump has been very reluctant indeed to criticize Russia, while he has been much more prepared to criticize China,\u201d said Chalmers.\n\nAt least two key national security nominees do not share Trump\u2019s pro-Putin views.

Another force pushing people out? Money. A lot of it.\n\nEarly staffers had an unusual compensation system that awarded supersized payouts based on the project's value. By late 2015, the numbers were so big that several veteran members didn't need the job security anymore, making them more open to other opportunities, according to people familiar with the situation. Two people called it \"F-you money.\"\n\nIn December, the car unit morphed into a standalone business called Waymo, and the system was replaced with a more uniform pay structure that treats all employees the same, according to a person familiar with the situation. Still, the original program got so costly that a top executive at parent Alphabet Inc. highlighted it last year to explain a jump in expenses. A spokeswoman for Alphabet, the holding company that owns Google and \"Other Bets\" like the autonomous car business, declined to comment.\n\nThe payouts contributed to a talent exodus at a time when the company was trying to turn the project into a real business and emerging rivals were recruiting heavily. The episode highlights Alphabet's difficult transition from a digital advertising giant into a diversified technology company with varied groups of employees requiring different incentives. Other new businesses, including health care unit Verily, use different compensation systems too, but they have yet to generate huge payouts like the car project.\n\nThe unorthodox system started in 2010, soon after Google unveiled its first self-driving vehicle. It was constructed to tie employees' fortunes to the performance of the project, rather than Google's advertising money machine. In addition to cash salaries, some staffers were given bonuses and equity in the business and these awards were set aside in a special entity. After several years, Google applied a multiplier to the value of the awards and paid some or all of it out. The multiplier was based on periodic valuations of the division, the people said.\n\nThe precise metrics that the division was measured by-- and caused the bonuses to balloon-- are not known. But by 2015, the Google car project had come a long way: Google\u2019s vehicles had logged more than one million autonomous miles; car companies including Toyota Motor Corp. and Tesla Inc. announced their own plans to develop autonomous systems; and analysts predicted the technology would transform the auto industry.\n\nA large multiplier was applied to the compensation packages in late 2015, resulting in multi-million dollar payments in some cases, according to the people familiar with the situation. One member of the team had a multiplier of 16 applied to bonuses and equity amassed over four years, one of the people said. They asked not to be identified talking about private matters.\n\n\n\nPart of the problem was that payouts snowballed after key milestones were reached, even though the ultimate goal of the project -- fully autonomous vehicles provided to the public through commercial services -- remained years away.\n\nRuth Porat Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much the payouts cost Alphabet, however, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat talked about it during an earnings conference call with analysts in early 2016.\n\nOperating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2015 rose 14 percent to $6.6 billion, \"primarily driven by R&D expense, particularly affected by expenses resulting from project milestones in Other Bets established several years ago,\" Porat said, according to a transcript. The CFO wasn\u2019t specific, but one of the people familiar with the situation said the comments referred to the car project compensation.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world.

Some were frustrated with the pace of progress and had doubts about new leader John Krafcik, while others wanted to start their own autonomous vehicle companies, people familiar with the matter said. The big payouts exacerbated the situation because team members had less financial incentive to stay, the people familiar with the situation said.\n\nChris Urmson, previous leader of the project, departed in August and is working on a startup. Other early project members left to form Otto, a self-driving trucking company that was quickly snapped up by Uber Technologies Inc. Bryan Salesky, a former Google car executive, started Argo AI, which got a $1 billion investment from Ford Motor Co. on Friday.\n\nUrmson and Salesky didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Sebastian Thrun, who started the car project and helped design the pay system, didn\u2019t respond to questions, either.\n\nDuring the early 2016 conference call, Porat suggested a different approach to incentives at Other Bets in the future. \"It is about getting more ambitious things done.

Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have exchanged compliments and suggested they would like their two countries to work more closely. During the campaign, Democrats warned that Putin was trying to influence the election in Trump\u2019s favor, something Trump explicitly invited before explaining he was just being sarcastic. Now U.S. intelligence agencies are said to be more sure than ever that Russia did meddle, and a Central Intelligence Agency official reportedly told Congress the intent was to help Trump. The president-elect says the allegation is laughable.\n\n1. What evidence suggests Putin tried to help Trump?\n\nWe don\u2019t really know. The CIA concluded in a secret assessment that Putin\u2019s government actively sought to help Trump and hurt Clinton, and that people with connections to the Russian government provided WikiLeaks with the hacked e-mails of Democrats including Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, the Washington Post reported. (The Federal Bureau of Investigation was said to be less certain on the question of Russia\u2019s motives.) The New York Times added that U.S. officials believe Russia broke into the networks of the Republican National Committee too, but didn\u2019t release them. (The RNC denies it was hacked.) Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, denies that the Russian government was his source.\n\n2. What does Russia say?\n\nRussian government officials have denied or dismissed allegations of involvement. Putin said during the campaign that Americans should focus on the information obtained by the hackers and distributed by WikiLeaks -- much of which was embarrassing to Clinton -- and not be distracted by questions about the hackers\u2019 motivation. \u201cDoes it really matter who did it?\u201d he asked.\n\n3. What do Trump and his aides say?\n\nThat the CIA was wrong at least once before, about Saddam Hussein\u2019s weapons of mass destruction. That the election is over and it\u2019s \"time to move on.\" That questions about Russia\u2019s involvement constitute \"an attempt to try to de-legitimize\" Trump\u2019s victory. And that, \"Unless you catch \u2018hackers\u2019 in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking.\"\n\n4. So is this just a partisan issue?\n\nNot fully. Republican leaders in Congress, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, indicated they take reports of Russian involvement seriously and will investigate them. Another Republican, Senator John McCain, said \"it\u2019s clear\" that Russians interfered in the election, though less clear they did so with the intent of helping Trump.\n\n5. What have Trump and Putin said about each other?\n\nIn 2015, Putin praised Trump as talented and colorful, though he didn\u2019t call Trump \"a genius,\" as Trump later claimed. Trump praised Putin as \"a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond\" and said of Putin, \"You know, he feels good about me. I feel, frankly, good about him.\" At the final debate, Trump said Putin \"has outsmarted\" Clinton \"at every step of the way,\" including in Syria, and reiterated his belief that Russia and the U.S. should work more closely together. \"If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good,\" he said.\n\n6. How about since Trump\u2019s victory?\n\nPutin sent Trump a congratulatory telegram expressing \u201chope for joint efforts to bring Russian-American ties out of crisis,\" according to the Kremlin. They spoke on the telephone about a week after the election, with Trump offering his hope for \"a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia,\u201d according to the Trump statement.\n\n7. Have they ever met?\n\nApparently not, despite strong hints by Trump to that effect early in the campaign.\n\n8. Why does this matter?\n\nKeep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily.\n\nThough the Cold War is over, the face-off between the U.S. and the Soviet Union still frames much of the world\u2019s military posture. That\u2019s why Trump\u2019s suggestions as a candidate that he might not deploy the U.S. military if Russia attacked a fellow member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- or that he \"would be looking at\" whether to recognize Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea -- caused alarm throughout eastern Europe and drew condemnation even from Republicans. Months before Trump\u2019s win, Putin was being accused of meddling in European politics and doing what he could to weaken European integration.\n\n9. Does Trump do business in Russia?\n\nHe says he has \"zero investments in Russia\" but has done business with Russians on major projects including construction of Trump SoHo hotel in Manhattan.\n\n10. What other ties are there?\n\nLawmakers from both parties expressed concern when Exxon Mobil Corp. chief Rex Tillerson, whose close relationship with Putin traces to 1999, emerged as Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of state.

Schumer and McCain were among four senior senators who issued a bipartisan statement a week ago warning that \u201cour democratic institutions have been targeted.\u201d\n\nFocused Panel\n\nIn a letter on Sunday to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the senators -- Schumer and McCain, along with Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Republican, and Democrat Jack Reed of Rhode Island -- called for a panel that will look specifically at hacking of elections and other areas by Russia and other governments, including China and Iran.\n\n\u201cWe share your respect for, and deference to, the regular order of the Senate, and we recognize that this is an extraordinary request,\u201d the foursome wrote. \u201cHowever, we believe it is justified by the extraordinary scope and scale of the cyber problem.\u201d\n\nSchumer said that to send the investigation to one committee or several committees \u201cwill leave things out, won\u2019t reconcile contradictory information and because the existing committees are so busy in the new administration won\u2019t get the focus that it needs.\u201d\n\nReince Priebus, whom Trump has named White House chief of staff, dismissed reports that the intelligence community had concluded that Russia was the culprit, arguing that the chiefs of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as the director of national intelligence, had yet to publicly state where they stood.\n\n\u2018All Over the Map\u2019\n\n\u201cThese guys should be straight with the American people and come out and say it. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been clear about it. I think it\u2019s been all over the map,\u201d Priebus told Fox News Sunday. He was asked to comment on news reports that CIA Director John Brennan had informed intelligence insiders that Brennan, FBI Director James Comey, and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper were in agreement. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard from Clapper. We haven\u2019t heard from Comey,\u201d Preibus said.\n\nThe issue is registering with the public. A new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll finds more than half of Americans say they are significantly bothered by the news that hackers working in connection with a foreign government were involved in trying to influence November\u2019s vote. Forty-three percent of respondents say they are bothered a \u201cgreat deal\u201d about the interference, while an additional 12 percent were bothered \u201cquite a bit.\u201d\n\nThose numbers mask a notable partisan divide: a combined 86 percent of Democrats are bothered a great deal or quite a bit by the interference, versus just 29 percent of Republican respondents.\n\n\u2018Covert Operation\u2019\n\nJames Woolsey, a Trump national security adviser who served as CIA director under President Bill Clinton, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that \u201cthere\u2019s strong chance the Russians are behind it.\u201d Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who has served presidents of both political parties, told NBC the hacks were \u201ca thinly disguised, covert operation to discredit the American election and to basically allow the Russians to communicate to the rest of the world that our elections are corrupt.\u201d\n\nBut Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota told Fox News it remains to be seen what exactly motivated the attacks, and \u201cit\u2019s a little bit premature to start coming to conclusions about what the U.S. should do next.\u201d\n\nPriebus said the debate over Russia\u2019s role in the election was a distraction.\n\nKeep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics.

Legal fights are multiplying after General Motors Co. and Uber valued upstarts -- each with just a few dozen employees -- as worth hundreds of millions of dollars in separate acquisitions last year.\n\nWaymo accuses several employees of Otto, a self-driving startup Uber acquired in August for $680 million, of lifting technical information from Google\u2019s autonomous car project.

Uber this week set up a commission led by former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder to investigate a former developer\u2019s allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination by her manager.

He also attended a closed-door fundraising event and staged a rally-like visit to Curbelo\u2019s Miami campaign office.\n\nEarlier in the day, Ryan scheduled no public availability as he joined Republican Brian Mast, who is running for an open seat in a nearby congressional district. When Ryan was in Texas for campaign events Tuesday, none of those were open to the news media.\n\nIn a normal election year, Ryan would be courting media attention and harnessing his star power to boost Republican candidates. But Ryan\u2019s highly publicized break with Trump has ignited a civil war within the party, one stoked by Trump\u2019s frequent Twitter attacks on Ryan.\n\n\u2018Better Way\u2019\n\nThe fracas has left Ryan trying to stay on message about a policy agenda being pushed by House Republicans.

Go to better.gop and look at the solutions.\"\n\n\"There are big issues at play in this election,\" he added, never mentioning Trump by name. \"Don\u2019t forget about that.\" Ryan ignored shouted questions from local reporters.\n\nCurbelo is locked in a tight re-election battle with Democrat Joe Garcia, whom he defeated in 2014 when Garcia was the incumbent congressman. Curbelo has been seeking to keep some distance from his party\u2019s standard-bearer and has said he won\u2019t vote for Trump.\n\nGarcia and Democrats were trying to link Curbelo with Trump at a rally Tuesday afternoon outside of the congressman\u2019s headquarters, in anticipation of the speaker\u2019s visit there.\n\nThe tension between Trump and Ryan has complicated electoral prospects for the presidential nominee, who is denying accusations that he groped multiple women, and for congressional Republicans, who worry that Trump\u2019s unpopularity could endanger their control of the House and Senate.\n\nIntra-Party Turmoil\n\nRyan is planning to spend October campaigning in 17 states and 42 cities to defend the House Republican majority.\n\nSome Republicans need the speaker\u2019s help, particularly when it comes to fundraising, but not necessarily the added focus on the intra-party turmoil over Trump that comes with Ryan\u2019s visits.\n\nKeep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics.

For Osiatynski, the rate-setting council\u2019s only remaining member after this year\u2019s changeover, higher borrowing costs may be the worst option, but one that the central bank will resort to unless the government finds a way to keep a lid on wages.\n\nJerzy Osiatynski Source: Narodowy Bank Polski\n\n\u201cIf there won\u2019t be any progress in that area from the government, a rate increase is the only tool I\u2019m left with,\u201d he said in an interview in Warsaw. \u201cI\u2019d like to avoid a situation in which the council raises rates even as investment is performing badly and the economy expands at the current rate.\u201d\n\nPaychecks are soaring across the European Union\u2019s former communist east, a dilemma for central banks that have kept rates at historical lows to escape the grip of deflation. Poland\u2019s government has shown little concern for inflation after sweeping into power last year on promises to boost welfare spending and protect poorer voters. Meanwhile, even with unemployment falling to a record and wages spiking, economic growth has disappointed.\n\nDerivatives traders have scaled back their wagers on changes in monetary policy and now see it on hold over the next 12 months. The zloty was little changed against the euro in Warsaw on Tuesday, while the yield on the government\u2019s 10-year bond dropped four basis points to 3.03 percent.\n\nGrowth in Polish corporate wages accelerated to an annual 4.3 percent in the second quarter, the fastest in four years, while salaries in the public sector -- which employs more than 8 percent of the total workforce -- soared 6.5 percent, the most since the start of 2011. The government earlier this year raised the minimum wage to 2,000 zloty ($509) as of 2017, an increase of 8.1 percent from 2016.\n\nEmployment in September gained 3.2 percent from a year earlier, more than forecast by economists, and wage growth slowed to 3.9 percent after an increase of 4.7 percent in August, the Central Statistical Office said on Tuesday.\n\n\u2018Strong Support\u2019\n\n\u201cWhile the real wage bill declined, it still stayed at a high level, confirming the labor market\u2019s strong support for domestic private consumption,\u201d said Piotr Piekos, a senior economist at Bank Pekao SA.\n\nAlthough that\u2019s helping Poland catch up with richer neighbors in the west, productivity gains haven\u2019t kept up, meaning there\u2019s a greater risk that companies will have to raise prices to cover higher labor costs. For a model that could shape the government approach, Osiatynski points to Scandinavian countries or Germany, which he said succeeded in the past by finding a social compromise and containing wage growth for the sake of price stability.\n\n\u201cWithout any fiscal tightening -- and the government seeking to tame wage growth through a compromise with other social partners -- increasingly higher growth of unit labor costs has to be passed on to prices, causing an acceleration of inflation,\u201d Osiatynski said.\n\nNext Move\n\nThe most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.\n\nPolish Monetary Policy Council member Eugeniusz Gatnar has already cited rising wages among the key reasons that the end for deflation is near, signaling the next move in borrowing costs will be up. With the benchmark on hold for 18 months, Governor Adam Glapinski has indicated the central bank is moving closer to its first rate increase since 2012 and said in October that early 2018 was the likely time for the start of policy tightening.\n\n\u201cWhile cutting rates doesn\u2019t bolster economic growth in the current environment, increasing the benchmark rate would definitely cool down the economy,\u201d Osiatynski said.\n\nThe central bank governor\u2019s rationale for tighter policy is strong economic growth. Gross domestic product expanded by at least 3 percent every quarter for the past two years.

Rubio said Tuesday he wants Tillerson to show that he has \u201cmoral clarity, is free of potential conflicts of interest\u201d and \u201cwill be a forceful advocate for America\u2019s foreign policy goals.\u201d\n\nBut it would be highly unusual for a Republican-controlled Senate to reject nominees of its own party\u2019s president, particularly for such a critical Cabinet post. GOP senators will be very reluctant to pick such a high-profile fight with President-elect Donald Trump early on, and there is a long Senate tradition of deference to a president being able to select his or her own Cabinet.\n\nThere are early signs that deference would prevail and Tillerson could go on to become the nation\u2019s top diplomat, although he will still face a potentially messy confirmation process with Democrats ready to attack his and Exxon\u2019s record on Russia, climate change and the environment.\n\nManaging Risk\n\nTillerson quickly won praise from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who lauded his experience in strategic planning and \"managing international partnerships and risk.\u201d Even longtime Trump skeptics like Jeff Flake of Arizona said they were open to the choice.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t a traditional year, and there are two main ways that Tillerson could be blocked.\n\nFirst, a single Republican senator on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that will consider the nomination -- Rubio, perhaps -- could keep the nomination from reaching the Senate floor, if Democrats stick together. That\u2019s because the 10-9 Republican majority on the committee leaves no margin for error.\n\nAnother Republican on the panel, Kentucky\u2019s Rand Paul, declined to comment Tuesday, but had said he was prepared to oppose other possible Trump picks for the post. McConnell could choose to bypass or overrule the committee, but that would be an unprecedented move for a cabinet nomination.\n\nSecond, even if Tillerson makes it to the Senate floor, it would take just three Republicans to sink his nomination, as long as all Democrats hold together.\n\n\u201cBased upon his extensive business dealings with the Putin government and his previous opposition of efforts to impose sanctions on the Russian government, there are many questions which must be answered,\u201d Graham said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cI expect the U.S.-Russian relationship to be front and center in his confirmation process.\u201d\n\nRussia ties won\u2019t be the only potential obstacle for Tillerson. He has long faced scrutiny over Exxon\u2019s longstanding reluctance to acknowledge climate change, while Democrats have been critical of the oil giant\u2019s environmental record. Tillerson\u2019s ties to dictators, Arab oil sheiks and regimes accused of human rights violations could also face scrutiny.\n\nLengthy Process\n\nNo Democrat has yet praised Tillerson\u2019s possible rise to a post that would make him America\u2019s top diplomat. The incoming Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said he had \"serious concerns\" and signaled a lengthy confirmation process.\n\n\u201cThe members of the Foreign Relations Committee, both Democrat and Republican, should be given ample time to study Mr. Tillerson\u2019s entire record and worldview and then ask several rounds of extensive questions,\u201d Schumer said Tuesday in a statement.\n\nTillerson is no stranger to Congress. He has appeared several times before congressional hearings, including on the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico and on tax incentives for oil companies.\n\nUnlike some other candidates for the job considered by Trump, such as former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, Tillerson\u2019s own views on a wide range of foreign policy issues are largely unknown.\n\n\u2018Troubling History\u2019\n\nThe ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ben Cardin, said Tuesday that he\u2019s highly concerned about the pick and questions whether the Exxon Mobil executive can pivot from a role leading a multinational corporation to that of an international leader.\n\n\u201cWe are interested in knowing the relationship between Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Putin -- whether Mr. Tillerson understands his responsibilities and what Russia is doing in so many places in the world against U.S. interests,\u201d Cardin said Tuesday in an interview on Bloomberg Television.\n\n\u201cWe have sanctions against Russia,\u201d he added. \u201cMr. Tillerson came out against those sanctions.\u201d\n\nTillerson, who reaches Exxon\u2019s mandatory retirement age of 65 in March, would be the first oil executive and the second Texan to serve as secretary of state. If confirmed, the State Department would be led by a man whose ties to Putin go back almost two decades at a time when possible Russian interference in the U.S. election is under scrutiny.\n\nIn Tillerson\u2019s favor, Flake, a frequent Trump critic who is on the Foreign Relations panel, tweeted Tuesday that early endorsements of the executive are encouraging.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Condi Rice, James Baker and Bob Gates are recommending Tillerson carries considerable weight,\u201d Flake said Tuesday in a posting on Twitter. \u201cI look forward to the hearings.\u201d Gates noted that Exxon is a client of RiceHadleyGates, the consultancy in which he and Rice are principals.\n\nMany Battles\n\nIt\u2019s possible Tillerson will ultimately pull in some Democratic support. Democrats may want to save their battles, and are already promising bruising fights over Trump\u2019s nominations of former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, Representative Tom Price, an Obamacare foe, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to run the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nSo far, though, Democratic backing is elusive.\n\nSenator Tim Kaine of Virginia, a top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee and the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee, hinted at his opposition earlier Tuesday. He alluded to charges by environmental groups that Exxon knew about the harmful effects of fossil fuels as many as four decades ago and never informed investors or the public.\n\n\u201cTillerson for Secretary of State! What\u2019s next -- climate change deniers for EPA & Energy? Oh wait....\u201d he tweeted.\n\nAnother Democratic panel member, Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, in a statement accused Tillerson of having a too-cozy relationship with Putin and working against U.S. policy in Iraq when Exxon signed an oil agreement that Murphy said worked against American efforts to unify Iraq under a central government in Baghdad.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt Rex Tillerson is a successful businessman and a very smart person,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut he has proven, many times, his willingness to put oil profits before national interests, and handing him the keys of U.S. foreign policy is a recipe for disaster.\u201d\n\nSenator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, another Foreign Relations member, added, \u201cExxonMobil\u2019s global drilling interests, especially in Russia and the Ukraine, raise serious questions about conflicts of interest for Mr. Tillerson. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want to drain the swamp, he wants to drill in it.\u201d\n\nHuman Rights\n\nKeep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily.\n\nAdding to the mix is the potential for human rights concerns to be raised with an executive of a company with business dealings in Africa and elsewhere. Tillerson also could face questions about his views on U.S. energy independence; he said in 2012 he seeks a reliable, affordable energy supply with less concern about whether the source is domestic or foreign. His stance as a free-trader also puts him at odds with Trump and may be raised as an issue.\n\nThere\u2019s also a looming inquiry into Russian meddling in the election. The Washington Post reported on Friday that the CIA has told senators that Putin\u2019s government was actively seeking to help Trump win the election -- a step beyond an earlier finding that the goal was to undermine the credibility of the U.S. political process.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has ordered a full review of the evidence of Russian hacking. Trump has rejected the idea that Russia has been pinpointed as the source of the hacks of Democratic Party servers.\n\nMcCain, who leads the Senate Armed Services Committee, has asked Graham to lead a new subcommittee that will probe the allegations.", "date": "2016-12-13 00:00:00", "title": "Tillerson Faces Long Slog in GOP-Led Senate to Win State Post"}

Given just how much Mexico has benefited from the 1994 pact -- its annual trade surplus with the U.S. has soared to over $60 billion -- there\u2019s the general sense that Videgaray has little leverage in the talks, that he will be mostly ceding ground to his American counterparts.\n\nLuis Videgaray Photographer: Susana Gonzalez/Bloomberg\n\nBut Videgaray can be a formidable dealmaker. A 48-year-old MIT-trained economist, he\u2019s long been considered in Mexico to be the master strategist behind President Enrique Pena Nieto\u2019s rise to power. He\u2019s also forged strong relationships with both Trump, who has referred to him as a \u201cwonderful man,\u201d and Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. What\u2019s more, he may have a card to play in talks that\u2019s been overlooked: security.\n\nIf Mexico were to, say, end cooperation with the U.S. on anti-drug trafficking or counter-terrorism efforts, it could hamstring an administration that\u2019s made border security another of its top priorities, having even chosen to unveil its plan to build a new wall just as the Mexican contingent was getting to work in Washington. Videgaray hinted at his strategy Monday, telling the Televisa TV network that \u201cthis can\u2019t be a negotiation where we only discuss trade.\"\n\n\u201cThere are many areas in which the U.S. needs the cooperation of Mexico, such as security and immigration,\" he said.\n\nComeback Kid\n\nThat Videgaray has even made it to this point underscores the kind of shrewd operator he is. Back in August, during the height of the bitter U.S. campaign, he invited Trump to Mexico City to meet with Pena Nieto. In many parts of Mexico, this was wildly unpopular. After all, Trump had used disparaging comments about Mexican immigrants to help launch his candidacy. Pena Nieto\u2019s administration came under such criticism that Videgaray was forced to resign from the cabinet position he held at the time, finance minister.\n\nBut when Trump pulled off the election-day shocker two months later, Videgaray was suddenly summoned back to the presidential palace and appointed foreign minister so he could oversee the Nafta renegotiation talks.\n\nHe met with National Security Adviser Michael Flynn on the first day of his two-day trip and is scheduled to meet with Kushner on Thursday, according to a White House aide who asked not to be identified. Mexico\u2019s Foreign Ministry has said it also expects U.S. trade adviser Peter Navarro and Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to be involved in the talks. Videgaray has been accompanied by Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo.\n\nSummit Cancelled\n\nThe meetings were to be a prelude to a summit planned for next between between the two presidents. Pena Nieto scuttled the face-to-face talk with Trump in a Twitter message after the U.S. leader blasted him in a tweet Thursday morning for saying Mexico would refuse to pay for a barrier on the U.S. southern border. \u201cIf Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nPena Nieto responded in his tweet: \u201cThis morning we\u2019ve informed the White House that I won\u2019t attend the working meeting scheduled for next Tuesday with @Potus.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s announcement of the border-wall plan Wednesday rankled many in Mexico and triggered calls for Pena Nieto himself to cancel his trip, the hope among his supporters is that visiting Trump within days of his inauguration will lead to a quick understanding of the general guidelines for revising Nafta. That, in turn, could help stabilize the Mexican peso, which has sunk repeatedly to new record lows amid concern the accord could undergo major revisions. Canada, the third partner in Nafta, is sitting out the talks for now.\n\n\"Trump is a negotiator, so he\u2019s setting the bar high,\" said Alejandro Schtulmann, president of Mexico City-based political-risk advisory firm Empra. \"Videgaray is skillful, but it remains to be seen what he can offer.\"\n\nInternet, Energy\n\nBeyond Videgaray\u2019s security comments Monday, Mexican officials have been tight-lipped in their negotiating plans, and they remained so after the first day of meetings in Washington. In the past, they\u2019ve signaled that they\u2019re prepared to broaden the accord to include industries like internet commerce and energy.\n\nTrump has been more direct about his goal. He\u2019s spoken repeatedly about manufacturing, saying that investments in Mexico by U.S. companies seeking lower labor costs have deprived cities like Detroit and Cleveland of thousands of jobs. Trump used Twitter to threaten a 35 percent tax on General Motors Co. and Toyota Motor Corp\u2019s imports and cut a deal with Carrier Corp. to keep the company from moving some jobs south of the border. (His White House aide would only say that this week\u2019s talks would focus primarily on trade but could also touch on the wall.)\n\nTrump may demand changes that effectively boost the share of auto manufacturing in the U.S., either through tariffs or regulations that require more of the inputs for vehicles to come from North America. Pena Nieto and Videgaray have been adamant that North America should remain free of tariffs, and Trump\u2019s plans could endanger an auto industry that has taken off in Mexico in recent years.\n\nRead more: Why Trump\u2019s \u2018Big Border Tax\u2019 Gets Taken Seriously: QuickTake Q&A\n\nKeep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics.

With their holdings currently equivalent to almost three times the Czech Republic\u2019s surplus of foreign trade in goods, it will be a struggle to find koruna buyers when they pull out.

But Rezac says this will only trigger limited gains because non-resident holdings of the country\u2019s bonds are at a record 364 billion koruna ($14.8 billion), dwarfing its 140 billion koruna trade surplus, the main source of demand for the currency.\n\n\u201cThey have built substantial positions, but the capacity of the currency market will be limited by a much smaller number of counterparties,\u201d he said. \u201cOther than some short-term volatility, the strengthening may not be so fast.\u201d\n\nThe most important business stories of the day.

The government is taking advantage of the drop in yields, concentrating most of its borrowing since September in securities with maturities of up to three years.\n\nDomestic notes due in January 2018 on Thursday slid from a four-month high, lifting the rate two basis points to minus 0.12 percent, or 51 basis points higher than comparable German bunds. By contrast, 10-year Czech bonds yielded plus 0.40 percent, while the koruna was little changed at 27.02 per euro as of 2:22 p.m. in Prague.\n\nNegative yields at the short end of the curve signal foreigners are wagering on being compensated by \u201cmarked gains\u201d for the currency, according to Rezac.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have to extend their horizon and hold on to their koruna-denominated investments for longer,\u201d he said. \u201cOr, for psychological reasons or because of their risk-management limits, they will simply sell at a loss or zero gain.\u201d", "date": "2016-07-20 00:00:00", "title": "Investors\u2019 Dreams of Czech Payday Come With a Caveat: Be Patient"}

Like its counterparts across the globe, it added the U.K. referendum to the list of uncertainties but said it would be difficult to be more precise about its impact.\n\nBenda spoke before the country\u2019s statistics office published June inflation on Tuesday showing consumer prices grew 0.1 percent from a year earlier. The reading was in line with analyst estimates and above the central bank\u2019s projection for no increase. The bank said June inflation deviated only slightly from its forecast, which sees price growth accelerating near the end of this year.\n\nThe central bank has repeatedly intervened to thwart strengthening in the koruna, buying the equivalent of 968 million euros ($1.1 billion) in foreign currencies in April and May. After moving in a narrow range for almost seven months, the koruna slid to its weakest level since November after the Brexit vote. It traded little changed at 27.037 against the euro as of 8:42 a.m. in the Czech capital.\n\nBenda, who was senior economist at ING Groep NV\u2019s Czech unit and later an adviser to new central bank Governor Jiri Rusnok, said he didn\u2019t see any \u201cupper limit\u201d for the foreign currency reserves.\n\n\u201cHaving sufficiently high reserves is a good thing, because we don\u2019t know what kind of pressures the koruna will face in the coming years,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the story on new members of central bank\u2019s board, click here.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day.

Benda said there was only \u201cvery limited potential\u201d for sub-zero interest rates to ease monetary conditions, adding that the exchange rate is a far more efficient measure.\n\n\u201cI can theoretically imagine implementing negative rates as a temporary additional tool to support the exchange-rate commitment in case of excessive inflows of speculative capital, although I don\u2019t expect this to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t rule it out but, at this point, I think we will be able to do without negative rates.\u201d", "date": "2016-07-12 00:00:00", "title": "New Rate Setter Sees One More Year of Koruna Straitjacket"}

They rejected torture where Trump has backed it, and they called for a stronger NATO after Trump questioned it. Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson said he wasn\u2019t opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, while Trump has pledged to kill it.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s by inattention or acquiescence or by design, the fact that he seems to have hired people who are prepared to go public and fundamentally contradict him without cost or consequence so far is an interesting and intriguing piece of all this,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a former adviser at the State Department.\n\nTrump\u2019s Response\n\nTrump said he wasn\u2019t perturbed by the differences and welcomed the nominees\u2019 views.\n\n\u201cAll of my Cabinet nominee are looking good and doing a great job,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet Friday morning. \u201cI want them to be themselves and express their own thoughts, not mine!\u201d Later in the day, he told reporters at Trump Tower in New York that he had said to the nominees, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m going to do the right thing, whatever it is.\u201d\n\nWhile there\u2019s a long history of nominees offering shades of difference with their new boss, analysts said these confirmation hearings were a marked departure. This week\u2019s hearings featured Tillerson, Defense Secretary nominee James Mattis, CIA director choice Mike Pompeo and John Kelly for Homeland Security.\n\nIn a foreign policy speech in April, Trump warned allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to spend their fair share on defense -- a total that amounts to 2 percent of a nation\u2019s gross domestic product. According to NATO reports, only five nations in the 28-member bloc meet that threshold.\n\nIf they can\u2019t reach that marker, \u201cthe U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cWe have no choice.\u201d\n\nTillerson, though, testified that the U.S. commitment to its allies in the NATO alliance is \u201cinviolable.\u201d\n\nIran Accord\n\nMattis went further in a comment on the multinational accord aimed at halting Iran\u2019s nuclear program. While Trump has lambasted the deal that the U.S. and five other nations reached with Iran, Mattis said the U.S. was duty-bound to uphold it despite its imperfections.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a friendship treaty,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when America gives her word, we have to live up to it and work with our allies.\u201d\n\nRead more about how hard it may be for Trump to shred the Iran deal.\n\nAt Tillerson\u2019s confirmation hearing, Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, ticked off seven examples where Trump and the nominee disagreed, from Tillerson saying it would be a bad idea for Japan or South Korea to obtain nuclear weapons to coming out against Trump\u2019s campaign promise for a ban on immigration by Muslims.\n\n\u201cYou have a notable difference of view from at least some of the concerns based on some campaign statements by the president-elect,\u201d Coons said. \u201cHow will you work through those differences? And just reassure me that you will stand up to the president when you disagree on what is the right path forward in terms of policy.\u201d\n\nTillerson, the former chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corp., replied that Trump has been \u201copen and inviting of hearing my views and respectful of those views.\u201d Asked later how he\u2019d resolve any contradictions, Tillerson said: \u201cI have his cell phone number and he\u2019s promised me he\u2019ll answer, and he does.\u201d\n\nViews on Torture\n\nPart of the challenge for the nominees is that Trump has changed, or at least reformulated, his stance many times. During the campaign, Trump was a vocal advocate for restoring waterboarding to extract information from suspected terrorists, widely agreed to be an illegal form of torture.\n\nJames Mattis Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg\n\nBut after winning, Trump told the New York Times he was surprised to have heard from Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, that torture didn\u2019t work as well as sitting down with \u201ca pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers.\u201d Pompeo also came out against waterboarding in his hearing.

Earlier Monday,Trump\u2019s running mate Mike Pence also stood firmly behind the man at the top of the ticket.\n\nKeep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics.

Ryan told members, \u201cYou all need to do what\u2019s best for you in your district,\u201d according to a person who was on the call. But he didn\u2019t rescind his endorsement of Trump.\n\nTrump also lashed out at Ryan, with whom he\u2019s had strained relations. \"Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee,\" Trump tweeted Monday afternoon.\n\nA senior Trump campaign adviser, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said Ryan made a \"mistake.\"\n\n\"This campaign has always been about a grassroots movement not Washington,\" she said.\n\n14-Point Lead\n\nThe depth of Trump\u2019s troubles became clear Monday when a new poll by NBC and the Wall Street Journal -- taken after the Oct. 7 release of a 2005 audiotape where Trump described in vulgar terms unwanted advances on women -- showed Clinton with a 14-point lead in a head-to-head match-up, the largest gap so far in that survey.\n\nPence ended speculation Monday that he would leave the ticket, praising Trump\u2019s performance in the debate with Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton on Sunday night. Pence\u2019s reassurance of the ticket\u2019s unity was aimed at slowing the exit of Republicans backing Trump, which accelerated over the weekend.\n\n\"It takes a big man to know when he\u2019s wrong, and to admit it, and has the humility to apologize and be transparent and be vulnerable,\" Pence told supporters Monday at a town hall in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"And Donald Trump showed last night that he is a big man.\"\n\n\u2018No Update\u2019\n\nOver the weekend, House and Senate Republican leaders issued condemnations of Trump that stopped short of pulling their endorsements, a trend Ryan continued on Monday.\n\nRyan started out the Monday conference call with rank-and-file members by saying, \"I cannot defend Donald Trump,\" according to one Republican on the call.\n\nBut Ryan also said he\u2019s \"still supporting Trump,\" even if he doesn\u2019t condone his actions, since the future of the Supreme Court and other issues are at stake in this election, the person recounted. At the same time, Ryan said he won\u2019t be traveling with Trump or appearing with him through the remainder of the election season.\n\nThe Clinton campaign quickly pounced, saying Republicans are too late in trying to distance themselves from Trump.\n\n\"Somewhat of a civil war is breaking out in the Republican Party, but I think that Donald Trump didn\u2019t become the nominee of his party on his own,\" Jennifer Palmieri, a Clinton spokeswoman, told reporters Monday afternoon. \"These leaders help legitimize him and I think they have a lot to answer for and the voters I imagine will hold them accountable\" in House and Senate races.\"\n\nRyan\u2019s remarks caused some confusion for House Republicans on the conference call, according to a participant. At one point in the call, some conservatives, including Representative Dana Rohrabacher of California, asked Ryan whether he was withdrawing his endorsement of Trump?\n\nRyan replied \"no,\" according to other people on the call.\n\nNo member took the occasion to announce they were going to rescind their backing of Trump, or call on others to do so. But Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania -- a leader of House centrists who hasn\u2019t endorsed Trump -- was among those who decried the damage Trump is doing to the party, said a person on the call..\n\n\u2018Fight Is On\u2019\n\nRepresentative Greg Walden of Oregon, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, used the opportunity to tell House Republican colleagues to pay up on all their outstanding party dues, saying \"the fight is on\" to protect the House majority, according to one Republican.\n\nRyan had in June ended his own high-profile delay in endorsing Trump for president amid mounting pressure that left him increasingly isolated within the Republican Party. But that didn\u2019t curtail the continuing of his and Trump\u2019s tense and awkward relationship, often set off by controversial remarks and actions by the New York billionaire.\n\nNow, Ryan is trying to forge the a path forward toward Election Day, as he finds his party awash in turmoil and worry over damage to prospects for keeping control of both chambers of Congress, and longer term repercussions, including the 2020 presidential race.\n\nMost of the attention prior to the surfacing of the audio tape of Trump\u2019s sexually aggressive remarks had been focused on his impact on the races that would determine control of the U.S. Senate.\n\nSenators Split\n\nAfter the tape, vulnerable Senate Republicans were split between rejecting their party\u2019s nominee and trying to distance themselves from Trump without alienating his fervent supporters.\n\nArizona Senator John McCain withdrew his support for Trump on Saturday, saying he would write in a \"good conservative Republican.\" New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte and Nevada Representative Joe Heck, a Senate candidate, both called on Trump to step down.\n\nOther senators facing tough re-election races are still standing by Trump, including Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, who is neck and neck in polls with Democratic opponent Jason Kander, and Senator Richard Burr in North Carolina, who is struggling to put away a tougher-than-expected challenge from Deborah Ross.\n\nHouse Margin\n\nOn the House side, Republicans hold a 246-186 seat hold, the largest Republican majority since 1928.\n\nPolitical analysts outside and within the party had been predicting before this weekend that Republicans could see a net loss of about 14 seats. But there\u2019s more concern now by Republicans that Trump-related damage could now spill over in greater losses in House seats.\n\nRegarding whether Ryan is maintaining his endorsement, AshLee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman, said in a statement that \"there is no update in his position at this time.\"\n\n\"The speaker is going to spend the next month focused entirely on protecting our congressional majorities,\" Strong said in a statement Monday.", "date": "2016-10-10 00:00:00", "title": "Republicans Split Over Trump After Ryan Backs Away From Nominee"}

Inc.\u2019s Marissa Mayer, Silicon Valley is showing signs it\u2019s still a boys club.\n\nTech blogs blew up this week with the story of Adria Richards, who until March 21 was a developer evangelist at Internet startup SendGrid Inc.\n\nRichards received threats of violence and was fired after posting on the Internet an image of male programmers she accused of making inappropriate innuendos at a public conference. The incidents have left fissures across the industry, with critics saying Richards mishandled the offense and defenders saying her dismissal will discourage standing up to misconduct. News of guys audibly cracking sex jokes at an event that actively encouraged female participation also reinforces the image of a male-dominated industry unwelcoming to women engineers.\n\n\u201cThe irony is that this conference, of all conferences, attempts to really be inclusive,\u201d said Sharon Wienbar, a 22-year veteran of the technology industry and a partner at venture capital firm Scale Venture Partners in Foster City, California. \u201cIn a world where they\u2019re trying to do things the right way, this still comes out.\u201d\n\nRichards had attended PyCon, a programming event in Santa Clara, California, that promotes a \u201charassment-free conference experience for everyone\u201d in its code of conduct.

She took a picture of them and posted it to her Twitter Inc. account, along with a message about their behavior. She then sent a Tweet with a link to the code of conduct. Then her account began receiving threats of violence, according to Gina Trapani, a prominent app developer.\n\nRichards was fired March 21, amid a four-day social media firestorm, for \u201cpublicly shaming the offenders,\u201d SendGrid Chief Executive Officer Jim Franklin wrote in a blog post. How she called attention to the incident \u201cspiraled into extreme vitriol,\u201d making it difficult for her to be effective in her role at SendGrid, Franklin wrote.\n\nWienbar, like Richards, has spent her career in an industry dominated by men. Women make up only about a quarter of all jobs in computers and mathematics, and 23 percent of computer programmers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe rise to prominence of Facebook\u2019s Sandberg, who recently published a book titled \u201cLean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead,\u201d hasn\u2019t altered the fraternity-like atmosphere of the programming world, said Wienbar.\n\nMayer, Whitman\n\nIn addition to Sandberg, Mayer recently took over the top job at Yahoo, following another woman, Carol Bartz. Hewlett-Packard Co. is led by longtime technology executive Meg Whitman, while Ginni Rometty was promoted to CEO at International Business Machines Corp. last year.\n\nRichards, who has a blog called But You\u2019re a Girl, didn\u2019t respond to requests for an interview. She was hired by SendGrid a year ago with the title developer evangelist, according to her LinkedIn Corp. profile. Prior to that she worked at technology companies including Zendesk and was employed as a network specialist for companies including American Express Co.\n\nShe wrote a post on March 18, the day after her Tweet, explaining that the group of guys behind her were making sexual jokes about forking, a term that in computer speak means to take some software code and start developing on top of it.\n\nPlayHaven Employee\n\nTwo of the men were employed by a San Francisco-based startup called PlayHaven, and one of them was fired after the company reviewed the matter.\n\n\u201cThe result of this investigation led to the unfortunate outcome of having to let this employee go,\u201d CEO Andy Yang wrote in a blog. The company isn\u2019t commenting further about the matter \u201cout of respect for the privacy of our employees,\u201d said Laura Perez, a spokeswoman for PlayHaven.\n\nSendGrid\u2019s Franklin didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. In his blog post announcing Richards\u2019 firing, he wrote that while the company supports an employee\u2019s right to report inappropriate behavior, the way Richards chose to do so \u201ccrossed the line.\u201d He also wrote that her conduct put the \u201cbusiness in danger,\u201d and that the company\u2019s primary concern is its 130 employees and 130,000 customers.\n\nFranklin didn\u2019t say how the business was put at risk, though the company wrote in a separate post that it had received a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, causing disruptions for clients. SendGrid\u2019s technology helps businesses easily set up and manage the distribution of mass e-mails.\n\nE-Mail Disruption\n\nKISSmetrics, a Web-analytics company, was among the clients affected.

Those e-mails weren\u2019t going through on the morning of March 21 and were delayed until the afternoon, said Neil Patel, the vice president of marketing.\n\nSendGrid is now facing criticism for its actions. Rachel Sklar, an entrepreneur, blogger and advocate for women in technology, wrote a piece yesterday for Business Insider, arguing that by firing Richards instead of defending her, the company is deterring women from speaking out against sexist behavior that may be even more egregious.\n\n\u201cAnyone who thinks that women won\u2019t think twice about speaking up forcefully about this stuff is kidding themselves,\u201d Sklar wrote. \u201cMaybe not in the clear-cut situations, but in those blurry wait-maybe-it\u2019s-me-should-I-just-learn-to-take-a-joke?-everyone-else-is-laughing situations that happen so often in rooms dominated by dudes.\u201d", "date": "2013-03-22 00:00:00", "title": "Silicon Valley Boys Club Shown as Jokes Spark Firings"}

The number of unfilled positions climbed 166 percent in the past two years to about 110,000 in the Czech Republic, where unemployment is among the EU\u2019s lowest. In Latvia, that share has tripled over the past year while in Poland it\u2019s doubled since December.\n\nIn a bid to fill its own vacant jobs, McDonald\u2019s ran ads this year in Hungarian newspapers offering free lodging, with employees only required to pay utility bills. The Oak Brook, Illinois-based company declined repeated requests for comment beyond a press statement published in May.\n\nThe dearth of labor isn\u2019t limited to the restaurant business.\n\nLidl, which operates grocery stores, raised salaries by a quarter in the Czech Republic and by a fifth in Hungary.

Wage hikes are in many cases outstripping efficiency improvements, with Lithuania predicting salaries will rise 6.5 percent a year through 2019, double the pace of productivity growth.\n\nHungarian unit labor costs have risen the most in central Europe this year, according to Morgan Stanley.

Jaguar Land Rover is seeking 2,800 workers for a new plant in Slovakia, due to begin operations in 2018.

Growing demand for Polish goods and services at home and in Europe pushed turnover in the 40-member index up by almost half in August as volumes in blue-chip stocks declined.\n\nThe rally shows investors are searching for ways to escape the 11-month-old government\u2019s efforts to extract more budget revenue from banks, state-run utilities and commodity producers that have threatened to undermine dividends. Mid caps, including fast-food restaurant operator AmRest SA and telecommunication provider Netia SA, are poised to earn the most ever per share in the next 12 months relative to the 20 largest firms in Poland, estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\u201cWell-managed, mid-size companies with clear strategies and low regulatory risks are a haven for investors in Polish equities,\u201d said Hubert Kmiecik, a money manager at TFI Allianz Polska SA mutual fund in Warsaw, who favors automobile suppliers and developers. \u201cWe can expect their earnings to improve thanks to a relatively strong economy and investors should continue to buy their shares in the next quarter.\u201d\n\nConsumer Demand\n\nIndividual consumption in the country of 38 million is poised to expand 3.7 percent this year and next, the fastest pace since 2008, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, aided by record-low unemployment and new child benefits that gave families more money to spend. Economic growth of 3.3 percent in 2017 will be double the pace of that in the euro area, the projections show.\n\nThe pickup is filtering into the bottom line of mid-sized companies like Uniwheels AG, a Warsaw-listed German manufacturer of car wheels that opened a new production plant in Poland and in August raised its earnings forecast for 2016. Shares in Uniwheels, which has a market capitalization of $689 million, gained almost 50 percent since June 30.\n\n\u201cExporters benefit twice, from bigger demand locally, and from higher sales abroad,\u201d said Maciej Wardejn, an analyst at brokerage Wood & Co. in Warsaw, who recommends buying Uniwheels, rubber maker Synthos SA, hardboard producer Pfleiderer Grajewo SA and car-parts distributor Inter Cars SA.\n\nThe rush to find alternative investments is partly a response to Law & Justice\u2019s tumultuous first year in power, marked by economic policies that included replacing managers at state-owned companies with its own appointments. A tax on banks and the potential cost of helping citizens deal with Swiss franc-denominated mortgages weighed on shares of lenders, whose operating costs climbed 13 percent in the first half, according to official data.\n\nShares in Polish power producer PGE SA have tumbled 7 percent since Sept. 21 on speculation a plan to raise the nominal value of shares of utility companies may result in lower dividends as the government increases taxes for the state budget.\n\nThe most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.\n\nThis quarter\u2019s rally has driven the valuation of mid-cap stocks to the highest since March 2014 relative to large companies. The mWIG40 Index is priced at 13.8 times projected earnings, compared with 11.1 times for the WIG20 Index. Turnover that\u2019s only a fifth of the benchmark may constrain continuation of the advance in medium-sized companies, according to Andras Szalkai of Raiffeisen Kapitalanlage GmbH.\n\n\u201cThe liquidity of smaller caps and their pricing becoming expensive again remain the biggest challenge for such strategies,\u201d said Szalkai, who helps oversee about $2 billion in emerging European assets from Vienna and prefers exporters as state companies are \u201chardly investable.\u201d\n\nStill, analysts forecast Poland\u2019s mid caps will earn 293 zloty per share in the next 12 months, the highest estimate since May 2008. Larger stocks, meanwhile, will keep lagging peers in Prague and Budapest as long as government policies clash with investors, said Rafal Wiatr, head of equity research at Citigroup Inc. unit Bank Handlowy SA.\n\n\u201cInvestors are seeking small- and mid-size companies and it will be hard to stop this trend without changes of state policies,\u201d Wiatr said.", "date": "2016-10-03 00:00:00", "title": "Best Returns in Poland Are Stocks Flying Under Government Radar"}

Any steps we [Exxon] take to develop new resources, to promote trading relationships, to promote stability in countries, from a socioeconomic, geopolitical perspective, that is all in U.S. national interest. We do not represent the U.S. government as we travel around the world, we never pretend to do that and we never ask the U.S. government to do anything on our behalf. ( interview on Charlie Rose, 2013)\n\nFree Trade\n\n\n\nBy supporting free trade, opening up access, and allowing the free flow of goods and services, governments help industry find more innovative and efficient ways to bring energy to market.... History is clear and unequivocal: Free trade lifts the prospects of nations and improves the lives of people across borders, regions, and oceans. (prepared remarks for World Gas Conference speech, June 2015)\n\nTrans-Pacific Partnership\n\nCongress has been debating Trade Promotion Authority. If passed, it would give President Obama authority to move forward on two major, pending free-trade agreements: the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would strengthen the economic relations among 11 nations in the Asia-Pacific region, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which would increase trade between the U.S. and European Union. Completing such agreements would revitalize the global discussion of -- and renew the appreciation for -- the value of international trade and investment. (prepared remarks for World Gas Conference speech, June 2015)\n\nSanctions\n\nWe don\u2019t find them to be effective unless they are very well implemented comprehensively, and that\u2019s a very hard thing to do. So we always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions, and what are their objectives, and whether sanctions are really effective or not. (2014 annual shareholder meeting)\n\nGovernment\u2019s Role\n\nGovernments around the world must put in place sound tax, legal, and regulatory frameworks. With sound policies enacted, investment, innovation, and cooperation can flourish. Government works best when it maintains a level playing field; opens the doors for competition; and refrains from picking winners and losers. (prepared remarks for 2015 speech at Oil & Money conference)\n\nClimate Change\n\n\n\nI view global warming and climate change as a serious risk and I\u2019m in the risk management business.... It is clear that there is an impact [of carbon dioxide emissions], what\u2019s not clear is our ability to measure with a great degree of accuracy or certainty exactly how large that impact will be. (interview with Charlie Rose, 2013)\n\nEnergy Independence\n\nEnergy independence and energy security are really two different things. And I think what the U.S. policy and what\u2019s in the best interest of American consumers has been and should be -- is securing access to energy in a reliable, relatively affordable way. And if we\u2019re able to do that, where it comes from should be of little consequence to us, if it\u2019s reliable, if I have a system of policies that ensure I have reliable, affordable sources of energy. If you don\u2019t like the people you\u2019re buying it from, that\u2019s a different issue. ( speech at Council on Foreign Relations, June 2012)\n\nCarbon Tax\n\nWe have long supported a carbon tax as the best policy of those being considered. Replacing the hodge-podge of current, largely ineffective regulations with a revenue-neutral carbon tax would ensure a uniform and predictable cost of carbon across the economy. It would allow market forces to drive solutions. It would maximize transparency, reduce administrative complexity, promote global participation and easily adjust to future developments in our understanding of climate science as well as the policy consequences of these actions.

The United States and Canada both need this -- and other -- vital infrastructure projects. Keystone XL would do more than deliver oil from Alberta and North Dakota\u2019s Bakken Shale to refiners on the Gulf Coast. It would improve U.S. competitiveness, increase North American energy security, and strengthen the relationship with one of our most important allies and trading partners.

Model S sedan that drove itself into the side of a truck in May had ignored the manufacturer\u2019s warnings to maintain control even while using the driver-assist function. The agency said it found no defect in the vehicle and wouldn\u2019t issue a recall.\n\n\u201cThe auto industry just let out a giant sigh of relief,\u201d said Dave Sullivan, an analyst at consultancy AutoPacific Inc. \u201cThis could have started a snowball effect of letting automakers and suppliers become liable for human error.\u201d\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world.

It was a win for not only for Tesla but for companies from General Motors Co. to Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google that have invested billions of dollars in what they see as the future of personal transportation. Safety regulators, too. have backed the nascent industry, giving it the flexibility to develop products that they think could greatly reduce highway deaths.\n\n\u2018Very Positive\u2019\n\nTesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk called the NHTSA report \u201cvery positive.\u201d In a Twitter message he highlighted data showing the company\u2019s vehicle crash rate dropped by 38 percent after the company installed its auto-steer system.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the thoroughness of NHTSA\u2019s report and its conclusion,\u201d Tesla said in an e-mailed statement.\n\n\n\nSome auto-safety advocates have criticized Tesla for what they said was a premature introduction of its Autopilot system and said NHTSA could have taken stronger action.\n\n\u201cIf a vehicle could not distinguish between a white truck and the sky, that to me would seem to be a defect,\u201d said Joan Claybrook, NHTSA administrator under President Jimmy Carter and an auto safety advocate.\n\nRead more: Fatal Crash Spurs Criticism of On-The-Road Beta Testing\n\nStephanie Brinley, a senior analyst at IHS Markit Ltd.\u2019s automotive group, cautioned that it\u2019s too early to draw too many conclusions about self-driving vehicles from the findings.\n\n\u201cThis decision does not in and of itself tell us what will happen down the road,\u201d Brinley said. \u201cIt\u2019s really too soon. \"\n\nSelf-Driving Risks\n\nNHTSA didn\u2019t completely absolve self-driving technologies. The agency drew several observations about the limits of automated driver-aids and the risks associated with how drivers use them.\n\nAutomatic braking systems like the one on the Model S and those increasingly available on other new vehicles can\u2019t address all crash scenarios, NHTSA spokesman Bryan Thomas said. The crash in May that killed Joshua Brown, a former Navy SEAL and Tesla enthusiast, in Florida is an example of that, Thomas said.\n\nThe Model S\u2019s sensors couldn\u2019t distinguish the trailer against a bright sky as it attempted to cross the highway while making a left turn. Auto-braking systems are best at preventing rear-end collisions, not the cross-traffic collision that led to Brown\u2019s death, Thomas said.\n\n\u2018Full Attention\u2019\n\nSo-called Level 2 automated driver systems like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, which provide automated driving functions in limited circumstances, continue to require a driver\u2019s \u201cfull attention,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nCarmakers must anticipate that some drivers will fail to do so and design their systems with the \u201cinattentive driver in mind,\u201d he said. He also signaled that automakers will be expected to provide clearer warnings about the limitations of automated driver aids, saying NHTSA believes \u201cstrongly\u201d that \u201cit\u2019s not enough to simply put it in an owner\u2019s manual.\u201d\n\nSince the accident, Tesla added protections to its software that shuts off Autopilot if it detects the driver isn\u2019t paying attention. The software also emphasizes radar over cameras, and Musk has said that change would have made it easier for the car in the crash to detect the truck and might have saved Brown\u2019s life.\n\nNTSB Probe\n\nThe California-based group Consumer Watchdog said Tesla should have been held accountable for the accident.\n\n\u201cNHTSA has wrongly accepted Tesla\u2019s line and blamed the human, rather than the Autopilot technology and Tesla\u2019s aggressive marketing,\u201d John Simpson, the group\u2019s privacy project director, said in an e-mailed release. \u201cThe very name Autopilot creates the impression that a Tesla can drive itself. It can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board, an independent agency that has no regulatory power, is conducting a parallel investigation of the accident. The safety board is planning to issue its conclusions by early summer, spokesman Christopher O\u2019Neil said.\n\nIn spite of the crash, the Tesla Autopilot system appears to have improved the safety of its vehicles overall. Crash rates in Tesla vehicles equipped with the Autosteer system fell by 38 percent to 0.8 per million miles compared to those without it, NHTSA said in its report.\n\nThomas said Tesla was \u201cfully\u201d cooperative and provided data on what he estimated were \u201cdozens\u201d of Tesla Model S and Model X crashes in which Autopilot was active during the crash or 15 seconds prior.\n\nTesla was able to pull crash data directly from its vehicles, providing the agency access that \u201cwould not have been possible just a few years ago or with other automakers.\u201d\n\nTesla advanced as much as 4.3 percent in U.S. trading and closed up 2.3 percent at $243.76 per share, its highest since April 28.

Polls show two-thirds of Republican voters are still standing with Trump despite his vulgar comments about women, putting Ryan and other Trump defectors at odds with the mainstream of the party.\n\n\"We\u2019ve never been here before, this kind of crisis,\" says Curly Haugland, a long-time Republican party activist from North Dakota, and former member of the National Committee.\n\nThere is a more immediate concern: Once-confident Republicans now fear that they could lose control of the Senate and see their House majority shrink, as GOP candidates pay the price for Trump.\n\nCome November, the high stakes are setting up a clash between the congressional wing of the party, led by Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, also cool to Trump, and conservatives who still believe Trump should be president. That day of reckoning has been in the works since Trump won the nomination, but the Trump-Ryan split now brings it to the forefront as never before.\n\nRyan Backlash\n\nAlready, Ryan was facing a backlash from some of his more conservative House members. Ryan didn\u2019t formally rescind his endorsement of Trump, but conservatives criticized him for not standing with Trump after Ryan said he could no longer defend or campaign with his party\u2019s presidential nominee.\n\n\"The top ticket is the most important part of helping future generations. @realDonaldTrump is the leader we need to #MAGA,\" Representative Chris Collins of New York, one of Trump\u2019s earliest backers in Congress, tweeted on Monday.\n\nThe other top Republican in Congress, McConnell, declined to comment Monday on Trump or his Sunday prime-time presidential debate with opponent Hillary Clinton, which was watched by 66.5 million people.\n\nReince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told RNC members late Monday that he still backed Trump.\n\nBruce Ash, an RNC member on Priebus\u2019s conference call, said nobody on the call disagreed with the chairman.\n\n\"There\u2019s not a member I talked to that feels any differently,\" Ash said. \"Our support of the nominee is unbroken, and that\u2019s what was communicated by the chairman.\"\n\n\u2018So-Called Republican Leader\u2019\n\nIn a tweet, Trump criticized Ryan, saying he should \"spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee.\" At a rally later in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Trump continued on the same theme, saying, \"You have people who can\u2019t fix a budget and they start talking about the nominee.\"\n\nOn Tuesday morning, a day after an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed Trump trailing Clinton by double digits, the nominee tweeted that despite what he said was a winning debate performance, \u201cit is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!\u201d\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a top Trump adviser, had a veiled warning for Ryan in a Facebook Live session Monday afternoon, saying, \"I would hope that every Republican leader, so-called Republican leader, would look seriously at what they are doing an saying now.\"\n\n\"If you can communicate to your voters that Hillary Clinton is totally unacceptable and why she is unacceptable, you don\u2019t have to run around and defend Donald Trump,\" he said. \"That\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s job. But you don\u2019t have to abandon him -- because there is no alternative at a practical level.\"\n\nProtecting Control\n\nSome Trump supporters and House conservatives were also frustrated with Ryan, but many rank-and-file Republicans said they understood where he was coming from.\n\n\"I get it, the speaker\u2019s got to do what he can to protect our control of the House and Senate, shore up his constituencies,\" Haugland said. But how that will play out, or even work for Ryan while ignoring the top of his party\u2019s own ticket, is anyone\u2019s guess, said Haugland and others.\n\nOn the Senate side, vulnerable candidates have split in their approach to Trump, with nearly a third of the chamber\u2019s Republicans now saying they will not vote for Trump and some urging him to drop out of the race.\n\nEven those who remained in Trump\u2019s corner, like Richard Burr of North Carolina, made sure not to repeat New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte\u2019s gaffe last week that Trump was \u201cabsolutely\u201d a role model for children.\n\n\u201cBoth candidates proved they are not role models for the next generation, but we don\u2019t get to pick now any additional folks to run, so we have to pick who we best think meets the way forward in the future,\u201d Burr told reporters in North Carolina Monday.\n\nSticking With Trump\n\nRoy Blunt of Missouri remained one of the most pro-Trump of the vulnerable senators, quickly praising him for apologizing for his remarks on the 11-year-old tape, even as a number of his colleagues -- Ayotte, Rob Portman of Ohio, John McCain of Arizona and others took the opportunity to leap off the Trump train.\n\nSenator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who is being challenged by Democrat Katie McGinty, faulted both Trump and Clinton and hasn\u2019t said which candidate he\u2019ll support.\n\nSenate Democrats and their candidates, meanwhile, launched fresh attacks on Republicans for either standing by Trump until now or for still standing by him.\n\n\"The time for courage has passed, and the agonized twisting and turning we\u2019ve seen in recent days is simply too little, too late,\" said Sadie Weiner, communications director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nNo More Questions\n\nOn the House side, some Republicans appeared to be taking Ryan\u2019s advice to find their own path.\n\nRepresentative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, a leader of a group of House Republican centrists, said he told colleagues that it was time to drop Trump because he had already damaged the party.\n\n\"There is a battle going on for the soul of the party,\" Dent said in an interview. \"There will be a reckoning after the election.\"\n\nRepresentative Mike Bishop of Michigan, said Monday in a statement that Trump wasn\u2019t his first or second choice for a nominee, but that starting now, \"I will not answer any more questions regarding Donald Trump.\"\n\nRyan said during the conference call that he\u2019ll seek to keep the House and Senate majorities by campaigning in 17 states and 42 cities in October, with more planned.\n\nHow well his strategy of distancing himself and Republican congressional candidates can work is debatable, analysts say.\n\n\"As Trump\u2019s numbers crater many House and Senate Republicans will find themselves on the wrong side of polling trends,\" said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University in Washington. \"They can only distance themselves so much.\"\n\n\"Either it divides their base or it deflates turnout. Neither bodes well for Republican incumbents sitting on or near the fence,\" Huder said.\n\nDavid Catalfamo, a Republican strategist from New York state and a participant in the effort to draft Ryan for president earlier this year, had a more positive view.\n\n\"I think voters distinguish between Trump and down ballot candidates,\" he said. \"The big X factor is what the impact is on turnout. If too many of our GOP voters get turned off or think it\u2019s a blowout and don\u2019t come out it will be a problem.\"\n\n\n\n", "date": "2016-10-11 00:00:00", "title": "Ryan-Trump Split Foreshadows Bitter Battle for Soul of GOP"}

He\u2019ll replace Miroslav Singer, dubbed by the country\u2019s top tabloid as \u201cthe man who made everything more expensive\u201d for intervening to weaken the currency and imposing a Swiss-style cap on its gains. While Zeman has repeatedly condemned the policy as delaying euro adoption, the 55-year-old former interim prime minister and pension fund executive has defended his predecessor\u2019s decision, saying it helped avert deflation and recover from a record-long recession.\n\nJiri Rusnok Photographer: Martin Divisek/Bloomberg\n\nThe soft-spoken graduate of the Prague Economics University also inherits near-zero interest rates and will have to guide policy beset by disinflation risks stemming from cheap commodities.

The bank has repeatedly intervened in the market since the cap since the cap\u2019s 2013 introduction, and Rusnok said he\u2019ll endeavor to secure a smooth exit and prevent sharp appreciation when policy makers remove the koruna\u2019s shackles. The regulator sees itself keeping the currency regime in place until around mid-2017.\n\nThe central bank is also in the midst of a debate whether to use negative interest rates to deter speculative capital inflows once it axes the cap. Rusnok has said he sees a \u201clow likelihood\u201d of cutting the benchmark from 0.05 percent, which policy makers call \u201ctechnical zero,\u201d but he\u2019s also warned the central bank can\u2019t rule that out if it needs to cool excessive strengthening pressure.\n\nFor the central bank\u2019s latest policy deliberations, click here.\n\nRecord-low interest rates are helping the government reduce its borrowing costs as it increases spending to boost growth.

Dedek, who served one term on the board that ended in 2005, is now representative for euro adoption for the government, which has not set a date for a potential currency switch.\n\nThe president last week appointed two other new policy makers, Rusnok\u2019s former colleagues Vojtech Benda and Tomas Nidetzky, saying he wanted to strengthen the new governor\u2019s team on the rate-setting panel. The changes represent a shift in the regulator\u2019s leadership from the policy board shaped by ex-President Vaclav Klaus, an outspoken critic of the European Union and the euro area.\n\nRusnok has been a common fixture in Zeman\u2019s political career. A member of the president\u2019s former Social Democrat party in the 1990s, Rusnok served as as finance minister in his cabinet in 2000. After leaving the party, which is now the strongest force in the ruling coalition, Rusnok pursued a career in finance, eventually becoming the head of ING Groep NV\u2019s Czech pension fund.\n\n\u2018Wise Choice\u2019\n\nTheir alliance resumed in 2013 after the center-right government of Petr Necas collapsed amid allegations of corruption. Using a mandate that frustrated parties across the political spectrum, Zeman bypassed parliamentary procedures and tapped Rusnok to lead an interim administration.\n\nWhile Singer and Zeman have clashed over the currency-cap regime, the outgoing governor said on Wednesday the decision to select Rusnok as his successor was a \u201cwise choice.\u201d\n\nZeman initially said he would only appoint policy makers who won\u2019t do \u201cunnecessary experiments\u201d with the economy, but he named Rusnok to the bank\u2019s board two years ago, even after the now governor appointee openly backed the intervention regime. Rusnok said on Wednesday he\u2019ll seek continuity in the policy of supporting the economy.\n\nRusnok\u2019s elevation to governor ensures \u201cconsistency in the functioning of the bank board,\u201d David Kocourek, an analyst at Komercni Banka AS in Prague, said in a note earlier this month. \u201cWith the new governor comes hope that transparent decision-making will be strengthened further, both in relation to the monetary policy and regulation of the financial market and the banking sector, which will face great challenges in the future.\u201d", "date": "2016-05-25 00:00:00", "title": "Czech Leader Looks Past Currency Spat With Central Bank Pick"}

Now, he\u2019s finding that ripping it up after he becomes president may not be so easy.\n\nQuickTake Iran\u2019s Nuclear Program\n\nWalking away from the deal struck just last year might satisfy Israel and Gulf allies such as Saudi Arabia who say Iran\u2019s theocratic leaders can\u2019t be trusted, but analysts say it could sour Trump\u2019s nascent relationship with European allies, China and possibly Russia. Despite their distaste for the accord, some influential Republican members of Congress -- and Trump\u2019s nominee for Pentagon chief -- have said there is little to be gained from canceling it now.\n\n\u201cA number of people who have been very critical of the Iran nuclear deal are out there saying tearing it up is not the answer,\u201d said Stephen Hadley, a national security adviser under President George W. Bush who has been mentioned for a possible position in the Trump administration.\n\nMarathon negotiations last year concluded with the U.S. and five other world powers agreeing to lift sanctions targeting the Islamic Republic\u2019s banking and energy sector in exchange for Iran curtailing its nuclear program. Proponents of the deal argue that while it may be imperfect, it has postponed Iran\u2019s ability to develop a nuclear weapon for at least a decade. They say that a collapse would mean Iran could quickly restart that work.\n\nFor a QuickTake on details of the Iran nuclear deal, click here\n\nWalking away also would leave the U.S. with few options outside a military strike to curtail Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions because European powers probably wouldn\u2019t agree to return to the crippling sanctions regime that Tehran previously faced. They also would be unlikely to tolerate the secondary sanctions that the U.S. imposed on banks and energy companies for doing business there.\n\n\u2018Immediate Confrontation\u2019\n\n\u201cUndoing the agreement would mean a direct and immediate confrontation with countries -- no matter what the foreign policies a Trump administration would want to pursue -- you would want to work with in one form or another,\u201d said Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a former U.S. ambassador to NATO. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of confrontational policy I\u2019m not sure one would want to pursue come Jan. 21.\u201d\n\nCentral Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan told the British Broadcasting Corp. last month that it would be \u201cthe height of folly if the next administration were to tear up that agreement.\u201d\n\nRepublican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on CNN last month that he doesn\u2019t think Trump should abandon the deal and that Iran \u201cover time will likely hang themselves.\u201d Corker, who had opposed the Iran deal after it was crafted, is among those who have met with the president-elect and has been mentioned as a potential nominee for secretary of state.\n\nBacking away from a complete dismantling of the deal risks alienating some of Trump\u2019s supporters. The Republican\u2019s criticism of the Iran deal was a staple of his campaign speeches and featured prominently in his discussions of foreign policy.\n\n\u201cOne of the dumbest deals ever made, whether it\u2019s countries or any kind of a deal you can think of, one of the dumbest deals ever made,\u201d Trump said during a campaign rally in October. He had gone further in March, telling the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, \u201cMy No. 1 priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran.\u201d\n\nSanctions Legislation\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate voted 99-0 for final passage of a bill, H.R. 6297, extending for 10 years the Iran Sanctions Act, which authorizes a president to prevent investment in Iran\u2019s energy sector and other sensitive industries. While President Barack Obama has waived those sanctions as part of the nuclear accord, congressional leaders said keeping them in reserve provides valuable leverage against Iran.\n\nWhen they made the deal with Iran, Obama administration officials pledged that sanctions would \u201csnap back\u201d in place if the Islamic Republic violated the requirements to curb its nuclear program.\n\nThe Obama administration will \u201ctake a look\u201d at the bill extending sanctions authority, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday, stopping short of threatening a veto of it. The administration says the bill isn\u2019t needed because the president already has the power to sanction Iran if needed.\n\nA frustration of the deal\u2019s critics has been Iran\u2019s continued financial support for terrorism and the development of ballistic missiles. The U.S. says Iran remains in compliance with the nuclear deal despite its work on ballistic missiles that could carry such weapons, though State Department spokesman John Kirby said in July that the U.S. still has \u201cvery valid concerns\u201d about those programs.\n\nIranian officials have had their own complaints about the accord, saying it hasn\u2019t led to the flood of investment that they had sought, especially from European companies and banks that are wary they will run afoul of remaining U.S. restrictions on Iran related to its support for terrorism and its human-rights record.\n\n\u2018Fresh Look\u2019\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump\u2019s own team has issued more nuanced statements about their plans. Incoming Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said the nuclear deal was a \u201ctotal train wreck\u201d but acknowledged parts of it will be difficult to get out of.\n\n\u201cWe are going to take a fresh look at it, put fresh eyes on that deal, and I can assure you if anyone can renegotiate that deal or do something about it to make it better for the American people and not start a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, it is going to be President-elect Trump,\u201d Priebus said on Fox News on Nov. 23.\n\nTrump\u2019s nominee for defense secretary, James Mattis, is deeply suspicious of Iran, calling it the biggest threat to stability in the Middle East. Still, while he believes the Iran deal is imperfect, he said in a speech in April he believed the U.S. would isolate itself if it gave up on the deal.\n\nFor now, the focus among Republicans is on leaving the accord intact but seeking new steps to punish Iran as a violator of human rights and a key supporter of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The Obama administration so far has shied away from other action for fear that it would antagonize Iran and push it away from adhering to the nuclear deal.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day.

Instead of being supplemental to the camera, the blog post stated that radar alone \u201ccan be used as a primary control sensor.\u201d\n\nThe upgrade includes automatic feedback from the cars to GPS systems, to catalog fixed items that the radar sees -- such as a sign over a highway -- to prevent future false alarms for other drivers.\n\nThough controversial, Tesla\u2019s use of such so-called fleet learning is exciting and will allow the technology to progress much faster, said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who has written extensively on driverless-car liability. Tesla\u2019s growing fleet of autopilot-enabled cars -- at least 90,000 -- are driving roughly 1.5 million miles each day.\n\n\u201cTesla is actually using its customers as trainers,\u201d Smith said via e-mail Sunday. \u201cThese drivers will teach not only their own vehicle but also all of the other Tesla vehicles on the road to correctly recognize roadway objects.\u201d\n\nComplacency Kills\n\nAutopilot accidents are far more likely to occur among drivers who have been using the technology for a while, Musk said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the neophytes, it\u2019s the experts,\u201d he said. \u201cThey get very comfortable with it and they repeatedly ignore the warnings.\"\n\nWith the latest update, the technology that Tesla calls Autosteer will hold drivers more accountable for keeping their hands on the steering wheel. After repeated warnings, if owners do not hold the steering wheel, the car will apply hazard lights, slow down and come to a stop. The Autosteer system can\u2019t be reengaged until the car has been parked.\n\nFor a look at how self-driving cars may affect insurance premiums, click here.\n\nThe federal government is drafting guidelines, expected to be released this month, for automakers racing to bring fully self-driving cars to market.\n\nWhile Ford Motor Co. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google espouse an all-or-nothing approach -- saying that only fully autonomous cars are safe -- Tesla has introduced driver-assist technology in \u201cbeta\u201d form. Almost 1,000 Tesla customers are part of the company\u2019s \"early access program,\" which allows them to test new features and give feedback before they are rolled out to customers as a whole.\n\nAbout 35,200 people were killed in U.S. auto accidents in 2015, according to NHTSA. The overwhelming majority of vehicle accidents -- 94 percent -- are due to human error. Safety regulators want to improve human behavior while promoting technology that will protect people in crashes and help prevent them from occurring.\n\nMusk, in his defense of Autopilot, said Tesla vehicles have driven about 200 million cumulative miles with Autopilot engaged and it would be \u201cmorally wrong\u201d to withhold the technology. \u201cIt\u2019s quite unequivocal that Autopilot improves safety,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd with this update, it improves it even more.\u201d", "date": "2016-09-11 00:00:00", "title": "Musk Says Tesla\u2019s New Autopilot Could Have Saved Driver"}

Once considered a leader in the field, Google has lost its first-mover advantage to other companies pursuing more practical, less-ambitious self-driving car services, said former members of the project and other people familiar with the situation. They asked not to be identified because details of the effort are private.\n\n\u201cThey need a partner, a sales force, a strategy,\u201d said Roger Lanctot, associate director of Strategy Analytics\u2019 Global Automotive Practice.\n\nGoogle\u2019s project started in 2009, long before carmakers and most other companies seriously considered the technology. But when Singapore unveiled the first autonomous taxi service in August, Google wasn\u2019t involved. Instead, a small startup called nuTonomy provided the technology. Uber Technologies Inc., founded in 2009, will soon let users of its popular ride-sharing app hail autonomous Volvo SUVs in Pittsburgh.\n\nGoogle has driven more than 1.8 million miles in tests on public roads in a bid to perfect its software to handle difficult situations, such as driving in snow. Tesla Motors Inc. already offers partially autonomous features in more than 70,000 of its electric cars, and Otto, a startup run by former Google car project members, is developing a self-driving system for trucks on highways, an easier technological challenge than the one Google faces. Uber acquired Otto in July.\n\n\u201cGoogle still has an imperfect system and no clear path to go to market,\u201d said Ajay Juneja, chief executive officer of Speak With Me Inc., which offers voice recognition and related technology for cars, watches and other connected devices. \u201cHow exactly would they have shipped something by now?\u201d\n\nBroader Challenge\n\nThis is part of a broader challenge Google parent Alphabet Inc. faces turning research projects into profitable businesses. The company is more cautious about rolling out new technology early, after its Glass internet-connected eyewear flopped, according to one of the people. There\u2019s also a higher bar now for projects as Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat has said she requires clearer paths to profitability before approving more funding or expansion.\n\nPossibly the biggest drag on the program is the sheer scope of Google\u2019s ambitions. Its aim is to revolutionize transportation through full autonomy. The software must be trained thoroughly to handle all eventualities. Meanwhile, there are already methods to make self-driving cars good, rather than perfect. That has helped companies including Uber, Daimler AG\u2019s Mercedes-Benz, Tesla and Volvo Car Group catch up with Google, Juneja said.\n\nFor more on autonomous cars: Bloomberg\u2019s QuickTake\n\nUber\u2019s service, which is tied to the smartphones of drivers and passengers, can generate a lot more driving data, an essential ingredient to quickly train the artificial intelligence software needed to guide self-driving vehicles, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a recent research note.\n\n\u201cUber logs as many miles in 24 minutes as Google\u2019s autonomous cars have logged in their existence,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWhile none of these miles are fully autonomous today, we just point out the scale of experience that can accelerate the development of the AI, mapping and learning for autonomous cars.\u201d\n\nTesla, with thousands of internet-connected cars on the road, has a similar data advantage, one former member of the Google car project said.\n\nPartners Needed\n\nThe two main ways for Google to commercialize the technology are by including Chauffeur, the name for its self-driving software, in cars made in high volume by existing auto manufacturers, or through a popular ride-sharing service that could slowly replace a human-driven fleet with automated vehicles, industry experts said.\n\nGoogle has neither of these yet. It struck a deal in May with Fiat Chrysler, but only to put its software in 100 minivans. Talks with other car companies, such as Ford Motor Co., have yet to produce high-volume deals. And many car companies are pursuing their own self-driving strategies. General Motors Co. bought self-driving software startup Cruise Automation in March and invested $500 million in ride-sharing service Lyft Inc., gaining two important ingredients for an autonomous vehicle service.\n\nA Google unit invested in Uber in 2013, sparking speculation Google\u2019s self-driving software would automate Uber rides. But Uber is building its own autonomous technology now. Google is planning to expand a ride-sharing service built around its Waze navigation app, however that will only be in San Francisco later this year, while Uber and Lyft cover most major U.S. cities.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019d rather enable than do,\u201d Lanctot, of Strategy Analytics, said. \u201cAs enabler, they can work with all, rather than become a competitive target.\u201d\n\nFrustration\n\nSlow progress caused frustration among some members of the Google car project, and that\u2019s been exacerbated by early momentum of rivals that entered the race later, according to former members of the team and a person familiar with the situation.\n\nThe team knew what it would take to deliver a fully-autonomous system, known in the industry as L4, but some Google executives didn\u2019t understand the complexity, according to one former member of the project. The person left to help run an active business with paying customers, something that\u2019s missing from the car project. A Google spokesman declined to comment for this story.\n\nSeveral years ago, some on the team wanted to push ahead with a service that didn\u2019t require full automation, but Google co-founder Larry Page insisted on complete human driver replacement, another person said.\n\n\u2018Seven-Year Itch\u2019\n\nSebastian Thrun, the first head of the Google car project, left in 2014 to focus on his online education startup Udacity Inc. and develop flying cars with Page.\n\nIn early 2016, Anthony Levandowski, one of the original engineers on the project, co-founded Otto. He started the company with Don Burnette, who wrote software for Google\u2019s self-driving car, Google robotics expert Claire Delaunay and Lior Ron, who worked on Google Maps and Android smartphones.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nOtto\u2019s goal is to \u201cspeed the adoption of self-driving technology,\u201d according to its website. Levandowski told the Wall Street Journal in May that it\u2019s easier to prove Otto\u2019s technology is better than humans on highways, where the tasks of driving are fairly straightforward, than in cities, which generate more complex driving situations. Levandowski declined to comment on why he left Google\u2019s project.\n\nWhen Urmson left in August, other project veterans Jiajun Zhu and Dave Ferguson also departed.\n\nOne former member said the project is suffering from a \u201cseven-year itch\u201d as staff look for new challenges. Googlers like to see technology they work on influence as many people as possible, so it\u2019s been difficult to see the steady drumbeat of rival autonomous vehicle announcements while Google\u2019s project slogs through testing, this person said.\n\nThe New York Times reported Urmson was unhappy with the direction of the project under new CEO Krafcik and that he quarreled with Page about it. Urmson told Bloomberg he wasn\u2019t frustrated with progress, but declined to say why he was unhappy. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to get into it,\u201d he wrote in a text message, adding that he\u2019s \u201cextremely proud of both the team and of the work.\u201d\n\nZhu said he and Ferguson left to put together a startup in artificial intelligence and robotics. \u201cI joined the project 7.5 years ago when we were just a handful of engineers and look at where the whole industry is today,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail. \u201cIt would have been much harder to leave if we weren\u2019t so confident in the strength of the team at Google.\u201d\n\nAnother person familiar with the car project said Google still has the most experience in the field, and its technology is still the most advanced, despite the company\u2019s reluctance to use that advantage for practical routes to commercializing the technology, such as Otto\u2019s truck automation.\n\n\u2018Right Route\u2019\n\nStill, rolling out partial autonomous technology can be risky. Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance features, known as Autopilot, have been in the spotlight since a fatal crash in May. The company released an update of the software Sunday with enhanced radar and a GPS database and said that might have saved the driver\u2019s life.\n\nIn 2012, Google let employees test a partially autonomous system for automated highway driving and discovered the attention of the human drivers quickly drifted, leaving them incapable of taking back control quickly and safely. That persuaded the company to pursue full autonomy, even if it took longer.\n\n\u201cFull autonomy, although much harder, is the right route,\u201d Krafcik said in a recent interview with Bloomberg Businessweek.\n\nGoogle hasn\u2019t decided on a business model yet, Krafcik said in the July 7 interview. \u201cSerious snow testing\u201d is still to come, while it could be 20 to 25 years before most trips in cities will be provided by autonomous vehicles, he added.\n\nThat\u2019s a stark contrast to Urmson\u2019s oft-quoted prediction about his son\u2019s driving test. During a recent text message exchange, he declined to say whether he\u2019s sticking with that forecast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time and it\u2019s time to see what else is out there,\u201d he said after news of his departure broke. One thing he did confirm: He has no plans to join Uber.", "date": "2016-09-12 00:00:00", "title": "Google's Self-Driving Car Project Is Losing Out to Rivals"}

American companies beware.\n\nDonald Trump isn\u2019t even president yet but in a span of just 12 days he\u2019s twice claimed victory in getting major U.S. corporations -- Ford Motor Co. and Carrier Corp. -- to keep manufacturing jobs in America.\n\nThe Carrier Corp. plant in Indianapolis on Nov. 30. Photographer: Darron Cummings/AP Photo\n\nRegardless of how substantive the deals prove to be, the strategy signals that the man who prides himself as a master negotiator will use his bully pulpit to cajole companies into toeing the administration line, a tack reminiscent of the bygone interventionist policies of Lyndon Johnson, John F. Kennedy and Teddy Roosevelt.\n\nMany experts say the piecemeal approach, while saving some jobs, is probably too little, too late to reverse the long-term decline in manufacturing employment in America.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, for companies caught in Trump\u2019s cross-hairs, risks abound. For one thing, no CEO or company wants to be a highly-public target of the president\u2019s ire. (Carrier barely even tweeted about the discussions before the deal was reached.) And even if they\u2019re granted financial incentives to keep jobs at home, corporations may find themselves stuck using antiquated technology at high costs, putting them at a disadvantage to rivals who have shifted jobs to low-cost countries.\n\n\u201cIf Congress wants to erect some kind of financial Berlin Wall that prevents U.S. companies from locating productive assets abroad, let them pass a law,\u201d said Daniel Griswold, a senior research fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center. \u201cBut let\u2019s not have our president bullying U.S. companies to retreat from global supply chains and global markets.\u201d\n\nApple, Oreos\n\nTrump made reversing manufacturing job losses a staple of his presidential campaign, thrilling Midwestern crowds with promises to scrap or renegotiate trade deals and slap tariffs on imports if necessary. It\u2019s likely no coincidence that Ford and Carrier, a unit of United Technologies Corp., are the first to announce pullbacks from Mexico. They were two of his favorite targets during the campaign. So too were Mondelez International Inc., the maker of Oreo cookies, and Apple Inc.\n\nMike Mitchell, a spokesman for Mondelez, said the company has spent $450 million since 2012 to modernize domestic factories and remains \u201ccommitted to investing in our U.S. manufacturing network where it makes business sense to do so, as we seek to become more efficient, effective and competitive.\u2019\u2019 Apple said it was \u201cinvesting heavily in American jobs and innovation.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s possible, as the Apple and Mondelez statements suggest, that all this attention from the president-elect will force companies to think a bit more about saving domestic jobs and a bit less about near-term earnings -- an outcome that would be well received by many across the U.S. political spectrum.\n\n\u201cNational interest is now shoulder-to-shoulder with shareholder interest,\u201d said Nicholas Heymann, an analyst with William Blair & Co.\n\nIndianapolis Event\n\nThe Trump-Carrier deal will be officially unveiled Thursday in Indianapolis. Carrier will get $7 million in state incentives over multiple years, contingent on employment, job retention and investment, the company said in a statement Thursday. Carrier had said Wednesday that incentives were \u201can important consideration.\u201d The deal covers about 1,100 employees.\n\nMoving the operations would have saved the company about $65 million a year, which translates to a relatively insignificant 2 cents a share in earnings, said Howard Rubel, an analyst with Jefferies. Trump has pledged many times to cut corporate tax rates and regulations to spur job growth.\n\nUnited Technologies, a major defense contractor, may be currying favor with the incoming administration, said John Mutz, chairman of the policy committee of the Indiana Economic Development Corporation. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a supplier and the new administration is coming in, you want them to think favorably of you as a supplier,\u2019\u2019 Mutz said.\n\nWhat landed Carrier on Trump\u2019s radar was its announcement in February that it was cutting 1,400 jobs in Indianapolis. Trump highlighted the news at rallies across the country. The threat of a 35 percent tariff on air-conditioning units and goods returning to the U.S. would scare Carrier executives into reversing their decision to move the jobs, he said.\n\nFord Hot Seat\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen,\u2019\u2019 Trump said during an April 27 rally in Indianapolis. \u201cThey\u2019re going to call me and they are going to say \u2018Mr. President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nOn Tuesday night, Trump tweeted that he had reached a deal with the company.\n\nTrump also put Ford on the hot seat during the campaign for manufacturing vehicles in Mexico. But the circumstances of the automaker\u2019s retreat from Mexico are even murkier than the Carrier deal. In a tweet on Nov. 17, Trump appeared to claim responsibility for Ford changing course on moving production of a Lincoln sport-utility vehicle, the MKC, to Mexico. He posted the tweets after Bill Ford, the company\u2019s executive chairman, told him that the automaker no longer planned to move MKC production to Mexico.\n\nFord, though, never planned to close its Louisville plant, which also builds the Escape SUV that outsells the Lincoln version by 12-to-1. Ford already makes the Lincoln MKZ sedan in Mexico and is still planning to move all its North American small car production to Mexico.\n\nLBJ\u2019s Obsession\n\nIntervention of this magnitude has little precedent in recent American history. Back in the 1960s, Lyndon Johnson was quick to call up corporate executives he was unhappy with. Johnson\u2019s obsession was fighting inflation, though, not protecting jobs.\n\nWhen Bethlehem Steel raised prices, he labeled the company unpatriotic and bullied it into backpedaling. And when he realized he had little ability to force farmers to scale back egg price increases, he ordered his surgeon general to issue warnings on the health hazards that eggs pose, Robert J. Samuelson wrote in \u201cThe Great Inflation and Its Aftermath.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s efforts were largely unsuccessful. By 1968, the last year of his administration, inflation had jumped to 4.7 percent.\n\nTrump\u2019s jawboning is trying to reverse a trend that goes back decades. U.S. manufacturing jobs have fallen by 29 percent in the last 20 years to a preliminary figure of 12.3 million in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nJobs Lost\n\nAdvances in productivity, aided by factory automation and technology such as 3-D printing, will ensure that most of the lost jobs won\u2019t return, said Jefferies\u2019s Rubel.\n\n\u201cManufacturing jobs represent a smaller part of the economy today than they ever have, and they can\u2019t come back,\u201d he said.\n\nYour cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter.\n\nEven as Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence are heralding the Carrier news in Indiana, for example, officers with United Steelworkers Local 1999 are negotiating with Milwaukee-based Rexnord Corp. on severance benefits for about 350 Indianapolis workers, union secretary Lisa Duncan said. The company is closing its plant there by June 2017 and shifting much of its bearings manufacturing to Mexico, she said.\n\nA Rexnord spokesman didn\u2019t respond to a phone message seeking comment.\n\nOther experts suggest that Trump\u2019s approach, even if successful at times, will harm the economy and companies. If firms like United Technologies retreat from global markets, they will become less profitable and competitive, creating fewer jobs, said George Mason\u2019s Griswold.\n\nBesides, it\u2019s ridiculous to think that Trump will go around the country hounding companies to save jobs in dribs and drabs, said Lee Branstetter, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n\u201cIt would be an enormous amount of effort and after a while people would start tuning out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 27th time he tries this, it\u2019s just not going to have the same punch and he knows that.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, but right now, the jawboner-in-chief appears to be just warming up.", "date": "2016-12-01 00:00:00", "title": "How Trump Plans to Keep Jobs in America: Pressure and Promises"}

Photographer: Alexey Druzhinin/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFrancois Fillon clinched the center-right Republicans\u2019 presidential nomination on Sunday promising a major departure from incumbent Francois Hollande\u2019s handling of Russia. While Hollande has backed European efforts to limit Russian meddling in Ukraine and Syria, 62-year-old Fillon wants to revive France\u2019s relationship with Moscow and ease its reliance on the U.S., a throwback to the Cold War policy of Charles de Gaulle.\n\n\u201cFillon\u2019s vision is that France and Europe should be a little closer to Moscow and a little more distanced from Washington -- this is what he believes would be General de Gaulle\u2019s vision,\u201d Bruno Tertrais, deputy head of the Paris-based Foundation for Strategic Research, said in an interview. \u201cFillon could open a rift with some European counterparts.\u201d\n\nFillon referred to Russia as a \u201cgreat nation\u201d in his presidential campaign book and said it is a democracy that is not a threat to Europe. Staffing his campaign team with two long-time advisers -- Jean de Boishue and Igor Mitrovanov -- descended from Russians exiled after the 1917 revolution, Fillon has called on France to work with Russia, even in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nRead more: how relations with Russia resemble the Cold War\n\nPutin said this month that he \u201cwelcomes\u201d the statements from Fillon -- with whom he has a \u201cvery good\u201d personal relationship -- and that he wants to \u201cfully restore Russian-French relations.\u201d After the Republicans\u2019 primaries concluded on Sunday, Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a more cautious note, saying Russia doesn\u2019t get involved in other countries\u2019 elections. Pro-Russian leaders have recently taken power in Bulgaria and Moldova, while Trump has praised Putin\u2019s leadership and said the U.S. should work with Russia against Islamic extremists.\n\nGermany\u2019s View\n\nJust as Trump criticized Barack Obama for allowing relations with Russia to deteriorate, so Fillon has repeatedly opposed economic sanctions against Russia following its annexation of the Crimea, calling them \u201cinept and strategically devastating for our farmers.\u201d He also wants to forge a common energy policy so that the European Union can present a united front when purchasing Russian gas. Emmanuel Quidet, president of the Franco-Russian Chamber of Commerce, celebrated Fillon\u2019s victory at a party at the Four Seasons Hotel in Moscow alongside lawmaker Thierry Mariani, a foreign policy aide to Fillon.\n\nHis stance on Russia may not be welcomed so unreservedly in Berlin, where Merkel is trying to hold the EU line on sanctions in the face of growing criticism from nations such as Italy and Hungary. Merkel called Fillon on Monday and they agreed to meet early January in Berlin, according to a person on the candidate\u2019s team. Successive rounds of penalties that were imposed on Russia for seizing Crimea and then failing to adhere to Ukraine\u2019s peace deal are due for renewal at the end of January.\n\n\u201cWe will see how skilled Putin is at playing the Europeans and undermining the EU,\u201d Charles Grant, the head of London-based Centre for European Reform said in an interview. \u201cIf Putin is clever, he will strengthen divisions among Europeans by being reasonable and avoid anything like an invasion to make it harder for them to take a tough line and maintain sanctions.\u201d\n\nFillon\u2019s approach to Russia risks more European discord than just with Merkel. The Baltic states and much of eastern Europe are concerned about Russian attempts to destabilize their neighbors. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May and her Polish counterpart, Beata Szydlo, agreed on a united front to tackle \u201cincreasing Russian assertiveness\u201d after talks in London on Monday.\n\nGeneral de Gaulle\n\nUnder Hollande, France canceled the sale of two warships to Russia and backed sanctions after the annexation of Crimea. Putin canceled a trip to Paris scheduled for October after Hollande refused to meet him due to the bombing of Syria.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day.

Relations between Europe and the U.S. should be \u201cmuch more balanced\u201d because the Americans will be more narrowly focused on their national interests after Trump\u2019s election victory, he said in a Nov. 17 televised debate.\n\nFillon described Putin\u2019s strategy in Syria as \u201ccold but efficient pragmatism\u201d in an April editorial in the weekly magazine Marianne.

Waymo is emerging from this research phase as a standalone business owned by Mountain View, California-based Alphabet.\n\n\"We will continue to have access to infrastructure and resources Alphabet provides, but in this new world as Waymo we also have this feeling like we are a venture-backed startup,\" Krafcik said. Those resources include Google\u2019s software code from the autonomous project, and its powerful data centers.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s self-driving car project has lost several top executives this year, and some members of the team were frustrated by the pace of progress, especially as traditional automakers and rivals like Uber Technologies Inc. and Tesla Motors Inc. develop and move forward with their own autonomous-vehicle systems. After revealing the company name, Krafcik didn\u2019t offer any details on Waymo\u2019s plans for a viable commercial business.\n\nStill, Waymo is making some progress -- the company plans to start a ride-sharing service with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NA minivans using semi-autonomous technology as early as the end of 2017, people familiar with the matter said. Technology news website The Information reported earlier that Alphabet planned a self-driving ride service and could use Fiat minivans.\n\n\"Waymo\u2019s next step will be to let people use our vehicles to do everyday things like run errands, commute to work, or get safely home after a night on the town,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nAdding Sensors\n\nKrafcik said Waymo is adding new specialized sensors to Chrysler vehicles now, but didn\u2019t comment on how program has evolved, only noting that Fiat \"has been a wonderful partner.\"\n\nAt the event, Waymo provided details about its first fully autonomous trip, transporting a blind man around Austin, Texas, in October 2015. Krafcik described the feat as \"the first recorded fully driverless trip on public roads,\" adding that \"the team hopes to replicate that feat across the country.\"\n\nLaunching an autonomous ride-sharing service using Fiat vehicles is a more practical approach than Alphabet once planned. It designed small self-driving vehicles without pedals and steering wheels and wanted to use these to change the auto industry in more radical ways. Yet some regulators, especially in California, require wheels and pedals, and the company realized making its own cars would be too difficult.\n\n\"For now, the company will have to rely on using steering wheels and brake pedals. That\u2019s largely to appease regulatory rules,\" Krafcik said. \"It is our goal to get there without those.\"\n\n\u2018Better Drivers\u2019\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nWhile the unit now officially has a name, Krafcik dodged questions about its ultimate business plan. Project leaders have considered just putting its autonomous software in existing cars, making its own vehicles from scratch, and approaches in between. They\u2019ve also debated selling autonomous cars for individuals to own, versus a paid subscription service where the vehicles are shared among many members.\n\n\"There are so many models for us to contribute to,\" the Waymo CEO said. \"I think we\u2019ve been really clear that we\u2019re not a car company. We\u2019re not in the business of making better cars, we\u2019re in the business of making better drivers.\"\n\nThe former Hyundai executive acknowledged that ride-sharing companies like Uber, with existing networks of consumers, have \"valid\" models, but he stressed that Waymo\u2019s advantage will be in its self-driving technology. \"What we\u2019ve shared with you today is a very difficult thing,\" he said.\n\nAsked when that self-driving technology will be commercially available, Krafcik didn\u2019t give a timeline.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have more for you soon on the \u2018when,\u201d\u2019 he said.", "date": "2016-12-13 00:00:00", "title": "Alphabet Shifts Self-Driving Cars Into New Unit Called Waymo"}
{"sourceurl": "https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-27/proposed-trump-budget-said-to-boost-defense-spending-cut-epa", "sourcename": "bloomberg", "response_body": "President Donald Trump will propose boosting defense spending by $54 billion in his first budget plan, offset by an equivalent cut from the rest of the government\u2019s discretionary budget, according to administration officials.\n\nMost federal agencies other than those involved in security will see their budgets reduced to make room for 10 percent higher spending on defense, said the officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. The cuts won\u2019t affect entitlements, including Social Security and Medicare, which make up about two-thirds of the $4 trillion federal budget. Trump has said he won\u2019t touch either program.\n\nIn remarks to governors Monday at the White House, Trump called his plan a \u201cpublic safety budget\u201d focused on increasing law enforcement and keeping out terrorists. He also promised that \u201cwe\u2019re going to start spending on infrastructure, big,\u201d without giving details.\n\nThe White House is sending budget targets to federal agencies on Monday, a day before the president is set to deliver an address to a joint session of Congress in which he\u2019s expected to outline his priorities for the nation. The administration plans to have a fuller budget outline next month, and it\u2019s certain to come under intense criticism from Democrats and potentially some Republicans as favored government programs are slashed.\n\nThe budget is rooted in Trump\u2019s campaign promises, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney told reporters on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe are taking his words and turning them into policies and dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be spending less overseas and more back home.\u201d\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer added that \u201cthe reductions in spending will be sensible and rational, but they will also be tough.\u201d\n\nCuts Elsewhere\n\nIf Congress were to adopt Trump\u2019s plan it would mean that everything else government spends on discretionary programs outside of national security -- including medical research, veterans care, education, national parks, food and drug regulation -- would have be cut on average by about 10 percent, though some programs might be cut more and some less. The State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency are targeted for cuts in particular.\n\nThe White House budget is mostly an opening bid in what could be a protracted process to set a federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year. Congress approved $543 billion for non-defense discretionary funding for fiscal 2016 and $607 billion for defense. Those totals currently are set to be reduced by 2018 under the budget sequester law, which Congress would have to amend in order to pass Trump\u2019s spending plans. That process would give Democrats, who\u2019ve opposed cutting domestic programs, an opening to thwart Trump\u2019s plans.\n\nStan Collender, a federal budget expert at Qorvis MSLGROUP, said cuts of the magnitude Trump envisions wouldn\u2019t necessarily \u201ceviscerate\u201d federal agencies, unless individual ones were targeted for deeper cuts. But he said the impact would be significant.\n\n\u201cThis is not waste, fraud and abuse -- this is like lopping off a right arm and a right leg,\" Collender said.\n\n\u2018Meat Ax\u2019\n\nSenate Democratic leader Charles Schumer of New York said Trump\u2019s budget would take \"a meat ax to programs that benefit the middle-class.\"\n\n\"A cut this steep almost certainly means cuts to agencies that protect consumers from Wall Street excess and protect clean air and water,\" Schumer said in a statement.\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, an Arizona Republican, meanwhile argued that the military spending increase wasn\u2019t big enough for \"a world on fire.\"\n\nThe House Armed Services Committee Chairman, Mac Thornberry of Texas, also criticized the increase as insufficient.\n\n\u201cWe cannot make repairing and rebuilding our military conditional on fixing our budget problems or on cutting other spending,\u201d Thornberry, a Republican, said in a statement. \u201cWe owe it to the men and women who serve and to the American people to protect our nation\u2019s security under all circumstances.\u201d\n\nModern Threats\n\nVeronique de Rugy, a senior fellow at the Mercatus Center, a think tank funded by the conservative Koch brothers that is affiliated with George Mason University in Virginia, said Trump should first reorganize the military to meet the threats of the modern world.\n\n\"The defense budget is blotted with massive amounts of waste and spending that respond to the military needs of a world that doesn\u2019t exist anymore,\" de Rugy said. \"The new injection of funds will once again be allocated based on politics or outdated priorities rather than national security concerns.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported Sunday evening that the budget will assume economic growth of 2.4 percent--roughly in line with professional forecasters\u2019 current projections--but below the 3 percent growth Trump has pledged. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview broadcast by Fox News that the administration thinks a combination of tax cuts and regulatory relief will lead to economic growth of 3 percent or higher. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure this works,\u201d he said in the Fox interview. \u201cThis is all about creating growth.\u201d\n\nDefense Pledge\n\nTrump made boosting defense spending a central tenant of his campaign to win the White House. He has called the U.S. military, the world\u2019s largest, \u201cbadly depleted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also putting in a massive budget request for our beloved military,\u201d Trump said in a speech Feb. 24 at the Conservative Political Action Conference. \u201cWe will be substantially upgrading all of our military, all of our military, offensive, defensive, everything, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. And hopefully, we\u2019ll never have to use it, but nobody\u2019s gonna mess with us, folks, nobody.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s budget outline will show the president\u2019s \u201ccommitment to fixing VA,\u201d Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin said in an interview that aired on Fox News on Monday. Shulkin said it\u2019s not about increased funding, but a matter of restructuring the system.\n\nForeign Aid\n\nThe State Department will not share in the largess. One of the agency\u2019s deputy secretary positions, in charge of management and resources, is expected to be eliminated and its staff reassigned, people familiar with the plan said. Trump and his aides also are reviewing whether to eliminate many special envoy positions, the people said -- diplomatic staff assigned to key regions and issues, including climate change, anti-Semitism and Muslim communities.\n\nState also handles a substantial chunk of U.S. foreign aid, which the administration officials said is being targeted for major cuts.\n\nThe EPA, meanwhile, has been a consistent target for Trump. He\u2019s said the agency has too many regulations that burden companies and cause long delays for businesses trying to get approvals for new factories.\n\nTrump\u2019s pick for EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, was a long-time foe of the agency as Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general. Trump is slated to sign documents as soon as Monday compelling the EPA to begin undoing recent regulations, including the Clean Power Plan that slashes greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation and the Waters of the U.S. rule that defined which waterways are subject to pollution regulation.\n\n\u201cIts clogged the bloodstream of our country,\u201d Trump said of the agency earlier this month. \u201cPeople can\u2019t do anything, people are looking to get approvals for factories for 15 years.\u201d\n\nPerennial Target\n\nKeep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily.\n\nThe EPA is a perennial target for budget cuts for some conservatives in Congress, and advisers on Trump\u2019s transition team said its funding and staff could be slashed below its $8.3 billion budget this fiscal year. Myron Ebell, who led the Trump transition team focused on the EPA, said the agency\u2019s workforce could be cut to a third of its current size. The agency now has about 15,000 employees nationwide.\n\nPruitt declined to say whether his agency\u2019s resources could be sharply reduced during a question-and-answer session at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday.\n\nHouse and Senate committees don\u2019t have to embrace the president\u2019s proposals, as presented. They will hold hearings to establish a congressional budget resolution laying out a framework for anticipated revenues and discretionary spending allocations for the 12 annual appropriations bills for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.

The explosion incinerated a satellite that Facebook Inc. had planned to use to beam Internet access across parts of Africa, and set launches back across the world.\n\nMusk, chief executive officer of SpaceX and Tesla Motors Inc., wrote in a tweet Friday that the rocket\u2019s engines weren\u2019t on at the time of the explosion. Musk also asked for any recordings of the event to be e-mailed to the Hawthorne, California-based rocket maker.\n\n\u201cStill working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years,\u201d Musk tweeted on his verified Twitter account. \u201cImportant to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.\u201d\n\nInvestigative Team\n\nAbout 20 people from SpaceX, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the U.S. Air Force and around the industry are part of a core investigative team that\u2019s evaluating data to determine the cause of the anomaly, according to a person familiar with the investigation. Hans Koenigsmann, SpaceX\u2019s vice president of flight reliability, is leading the probe on behalf of the company.\n\nThe group will be conducting a thorough \u201cfault tree analysis\u201d to try to determine what went wrong. It\u2019s unlikely that SpaceX will return to flight until the investigators reach a consensus, said the the person, who asked not to be named due to the continuing investigation. Commercial spacecraft operators have to apply for a license from the FAA in order to fly, while range approval is subject to approval by the Air Force. SpaceX has NASA contracts to ferry cargo as well as astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nThe FAA is limited to an advisory role, the agency said. \u201cPer the launch license and FAA regulations, SpaceX will conduct the investigation with oversight from the FAA,\u201d it said in an e-mail.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nThe spacecraft had been filled with a common rocket fuel that explodes when mixed with liquid oxygen, and while there are many potential scenarios, a spark, static discharge, or metal on metal collision may have been enough to set off that mixture in case the oxygen tank ruptured, said Josh Barker of the National Space Centre in Leicester, England. Explosions on the launch pad are more uncommon than accidents after a launch occurred, because with engines off staff have more control over the process, he said.\n\n\u201cSpaceX have been very reserved around information being given out. As a commercial company this is no doubt to manage their reputation as best they can,\u201d Barker said. \u201cThey will remain fairly tight lipped until they know exactly what caused the issue. The request for more footage and assistance that Musk has called for shows that this investigation could still have a long way to go.\u201d\n\nFocus on Milliseconds\n\nThe accident led to SpaceX\u2019s second loss of a spacecraft in little more than a year, and occurred eight minutes before a scheduled test firing during a dress rehearsal. SpaceX, which was founded 14 years ago in 2002, said it began searching for the root cause of the accident immediately after the loss, reviewing about 3,000 channels of telemetry and video data covering 35 to 55 milliseconds.\n\n\u201cParticularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off. May come from rocket or something else,\u201d Musk tweeted. Asked on Twitter whether it was possible that a foreign object had struck the rocket, Musk replied: \u201cWe have not ruled that out.\u201d\n\nData showed the anomaly started around the upper stage liquid oxygen tank, the company said. The blast was a reminder of the peril inherent in space flight, which relies on controlled explosions to power payloads into orbit.\n\nAfter a Twitter user suggested that a noise sounded like a metal joint popping under stress, perhaps a \u201cweld failing on a strut\u201d or seam bursting, Musk responded, \u201cMost likely true, but we can\u2019t yet find it on any vehicle sensors.\u201d Last year, a SpaceX rocket blew apart about 2 minutes after launch because of a two-foot-long, inch-thick strut in a liquid oxygen tank that snapped.\n\nProlonged investigations \u201ccould prove problematic for SpaceX as they rely on customers using their rockets to launch satellites,\u201d Barker of the National Space Centre said. \u201cAccidents such as these can put operations on hold for up to 12 months.\u201d", "date": "2016-09-09 00:00:00", "title": "Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX Explosion Most Vexing Failure in 14 Years"}

Photographer: Martin Divisek/Bloomberg\n\nRusnok, whose previous posts include interim prime minister, finance minister and pension fund executive, has disagreed with Zeman\u2019s criticism since he joined the rate-setting board two years ago. The grey-haired 55-year-old has embraced the bank\u2019s regime of holding rates near zero and limiting currency gains. Here are the five biggest challenges he\u2019ll face as he starts his six-year term on July 1.\n\n1. Exiting the currency cap\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nRusnok will oversee preparations for scrapping the limit on koruna gains, now set at about 27 per euro, that was imposed in 2013 to ward off deflation. After repeatedly intervening in the market to defend the cap, the bank will try to secure a smooth exit and prevent sharp appreciation when it removes the shackles. The exact logistics have yet to be determined, with the bank\u2019s board discussing both a one-off move and a series of gradual steps.\n\n2. Negative rates\n\nThe central bank is also debating using negative interest rates to deter speculative capital inflows once the koruna regime ends. Rusnok has said he sees a \u201clow likelihood\u201d of cutting the benchmark from 0.05 percent, which policy makers have dubbed \u201ctechnical zero.\u201d He\u2019s also warned, however, that the central bank can\u2019t rule that out if it needs to cool excessive appreciation pressure on the koruna.\n\n3. Hitting inflation goal\n\nThe central bank has struggled to bring consumer-price growth back to its 2 percent target as cheap energy prices continue to undercut headline inflation. The regulator sees itself keeping the currency regime in place until around the middle of next year and scrapping it only when its forecasts show it won\u2019t have re-impose non-standard measures.\n\n4. Euro debate\n\nThe Czechs, along with their other ex-communist European Union peers, are technically obliged to adopt the euro. While the central bank\u2019s role in the process is only advisory, its status as a respected institution gives it a powerful voice in shaping public discussion. Rusnok has been less dismissive of the idea of ditching the koruna than other rate setters and has said sharing a currency with the country\u2019s main trading partner, Germany, would benefit Czech industry. He\u2019s characterized the government\u2019s idea that 2020 is the earliest possible entry date as unrealistically soon, and he told Technik magazine this month he\u2019ll try to secure adoption \u201cat the right time and at optimal conditions.\u201d\n\n5. Bank regulation\n\nCzech policy makers have opposed some parts of the EU\u2019s plans to unify financial supervision and regulation, arguing that keeping that in house means well-capitalized domestic banks are better insulated from credit meltdowns elsewhere in Europe. Rusnok is less critical of the plan and doesn\u2019t see a \u201cfundamental problem\u201d in the fact that adopting the euro automatically means joining the European Banking Union, according an interview with Lidove Noviny last year. Apart from the joint rules for supervision and regulation, the banking body also designs joint rescue mechanisms for crises, Rusnok said.", "date": "2016-05-24 00:00:00", "title": "Five Challenges for New Chief of Koruna-Capping Central Bank"}

Retail sales and construction for July missed analysts\u2019 forecasts, with industrial output unexpectedly contracting for the first time in almost two years. Instead of accelerating, the figures show gains in gross domestic product \u201cslowing sharply\u201d to about 2.5 percent at the start of the third quarter, according to Capital Economics Ltd. in London.\n\nAn economy staggering to growth it hasn\u2019t seen since 2013 would be concern enough. But in Poland, the risk is that a slowdown will spill over into a budget crisis because the government needs a stronger economy to squeeze out more revenue to finance an ambitious social spending program. It\u2019s already edging closer to the European Union\u2019s deficit limit of 3 percent of GDP, threatening the flow of 82.5 billion euros ($93.7 billion) in funds earmarked by the bloc through 2020.\n\n\u201cWith such a dismal start, acceleration in the second half is going to be hard to achieve,\u201d MBank SA economists including Ernest Pytlarczyk said in a report. \u201cWithout EU funds and even with the support of a strong labor market and additional transfers from the government, the economy is unable to escape 3 percent growth.\u201d\n\nA weaker expansion may also pile pressure on the central bank to cut short its \u201cwait-and-see\u201d stance on interest rates and reduce the official cost of borrowing from a record low 1.5 percent. The zloty weakened and traders stepped up bets on rate cuts after the data were published on Thursday.\n\nWhile distorted by fewer working days, industrial production slumped the most since 2012 in July and retail sales grew at the slowest pace in four months, according to data published by the Central Statistics Office. A preliminary reading for second-quarter GDP published last week showed a gain of 3.1 percent, missing estimates for 3.3 growth and barely improving on the first three months, when output rose 3 percent.\n\nThe government is seeking to maintain economic growth of at least 3.8 percent this year and next after GDP jumped 4.3 percent in the final three months of 2015.\n\n\u2018Weak Start\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is a weak start to the third quarter, which for now will have more impact for the Finance Ministry than the central bank,\u201d Jaroslaw Janecki, chief economist at Societe Generale SA in Warsaw, said by phone. \u201cThe ministry will need to be more conservative in its economic assumptions for next year.\u201d\n\nIndustrial output in July fell 3.4 percent from a year earlier, worse than every forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 24 economists, whose median was for a gain of 0.9 percent. Retail sales added 2 percent, lagging the 3.4 percent median estimate. Construction plunged almost 19 percent.\n\nThe most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.\n\n\u201cA deep slowdown in the construction sector has become more permanent than we had expected, limiting the chances for a quick rebound of the investment dynamics in the third quarter,\u201d Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego economists led by Tomasz Kaczor said in an e-mailed note. The slump among builders \u201cis related to a standstill in EU aid projects, and low output for the construction industry is the main reason of today\u2019s disappointment.\u201d\n\nPoland\u2019s $475 billion economy is struggling to accelerate even after the government unveiled the nation\u2019s most generous program of social benefits ever. It\u2019s forecast to dole out 17 billion zloty ($4.5 billion), equivalent to about 1 percent of gross domestic product, to families with more than one child this year alone.\n\nCostly Welfare\n\nWith the fiscal burden set to grow next year, public finances are stretched. Moody\u2019s Investors Service mentioned budget risks in May when it cut the outlook on Poland\u2019s A2 investment-grade rating to negative.\n\nPoland\u2019s Development Ministry this week revised its full-year GDP forecast to 3.5 percent from 3.8 percent as Andrzej Rzonca, a former member of the central bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Council, said the government was looking at the economy through \u201crose-colored glasses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe underlying trend seems to be towards weaker growth,\u201d William Jackson, a senior emerging-markets analyst at Capital Economics, said in a research note. \u201cThe consensus view that growth will remain well above 3 percent over the next few years is looking too optimistic.\u201d\n\nCurrency, FRAs\n\nThe zloty reversed gains against the euro after the industry and retail data, trading little changed on Thursday in Warsaw. Forward-rate agreements, derivatives used to bet on interest rates, showed expectations for 20 basis points in cuts over the next six months, the most since April.\n\nInterest rates have remained on hold since March 2015 even as deflation is set to extend into a third year. The new central bank governor, Adam Glapinski, has said that keeping borrowing costs stable is the \u201cright move\u201d for the time being.\n\nThe economic setbacks to start the quarter may give the rate-setting council pause.\n\nWith no \u201coverheating\u201d in sight, inflation is \u201cstill close to zero in the medium term,\u201d MBank economists said. \u201cTherefore, the MPC\u2019s rhetoric seems to be ill-suited to the current reality.\u201d", "date": "2016-08-18 00:00:00", "title": "No Escape From 3% Growth After \u2018Dismal\u2019 Flop for Polish Economy"}

Of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, as of Friday seven had a buy rating, seven had a hold, and five recommend selling the shares. Colin Langan of UBS Securities has the lowest 12-month price target, at $160 a share, while Charlie Anderson of Dougherty & Co. has the highest, at $500.

I am cautious on both hitting 2018 and 2020 production targets.\u201d\n\nLangan also said he has reservations about the Model 3, Tesla\u2019s lower-priced sedan, which will start selling at $35,000 before incentives.\n\nModel 3\n\n\u201cI am concerned about the profitability of the Model 3 given the challenging economics of producing a vehicle at that price point given the still-high battery costs,\u201d he said.\n\nTesla currently makes the all-electric Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle on a joint assembly line at its factory in Fremont, California. The company delivered just 50,658 vehicles last year but aims to make 500,000 cars by 2018. It\u2019s racing to retool the Fremont factory for the Model 3, which is slated to begin volume production in late 2017.\n\nSimultaneously, Tesla is building the gigafactory east of Reno, Nevada, for battery-cell production, which is expected to begin in the fourth quarter. Driving down battery costs is key to delivering the Model 3 at the lower price that the market is expecting.\n\nAutonomous Driving\n\nOn top of all that, Musk is seeking to make Tesla a leader in autonomous driving, though a fatal accident involving the company\u2019s Autopilot technology is under investigation by U.S. safety regulators. And Musk has also proposed acquiring SolarCity Corp., where he\u2019s chairman and the company\u2019s largest shareholder, while his cousin, Lyndon Rive, serves as CEO. The proposed merger, now under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission, could go to a vote before shareholders of both Tesla and SolarCity in October.\n\nEven some of Tesla\u2019s traditional bulls have shown wild swings in their price forecasts. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas had a target of $465 last September. He has since lowered it three times, with the latest coming in June after the SolarCity deal was announced. Jonas lowered his target to $245 from $333, citing the risk of the deal, among other concerns.\n\nWhen Tesla unveiled the Model 3 earlier this year, it was Musk\u2019s iPhone moment. Hundreds of Tesla enthusiasts lined up overnight at stores around the world to place their $1,000 preorders, a spectacle unprecedented in the auto industry. Ultimately, about 373,000 reservations were made.\n\nTrue Believers\n\nThat\u2019s helped to energize the True Believers. Palo Alto, California-based Tesla has grown into a formidable brand, particularly among millennials. Model 3 reservations skew young and urban. Doughtery & Co. raised its price target to $500 shortly after the Model 3 reservations came in so high above expectations.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe that demand is there for the Model 3 and any future vehicles, and that\u2019s why we remain bullish,\u201d Anderson said in an e-mail. \u201cOur outcome is that they become as large as BMW is today by 2025 in terms of vehicle volumes.

With incumbent Socialist President Francois Hollande attaining near-record lows in opinion surveys, and the party in disarray, polls suggest Fillon is likely to face and defeat Marine Le Pen, leader of the anti-immigrant, anti-euro National Front, in the final round of the election in May.\n\nA career politician, Fillon was prime minister for five years under former President Nicolas Sarkozy as well as having been minister four times in three previous governments. A fan of Margaret Thatcher, he is offering voters a program of economic reforms that include lowering labor costs, doing away with a wealth tax and 40 billion euros ($42 billion) in tax cuts for companies over five years. These include lowering France\u2019s corporate tax rate to 25 percent, compared with 34.4 percent currently and rates of 30.2 percent in Germany and 20 percent in the U.K.\n\n\"Fran\u00e7ois Fillon has made some very strong promises\" that move in the right direction, said Pierre de Lauzun, who heads the Amafi organization representing French financial market participants, whose 138 members include JP Morgan Securities and BNP Paribas Securities Services. Fillon\u2019s plan is more \u201cenergetic, courageous and far-reaching\u201d than that of his rivals, he said.\n\nIn a country where growth and employment lag European averages, potentially the most contentious aspect of Fillon\u2019s plan is to scrap France\u2019s 35-hour work week, which critics say hinders the ability of manufacturers to compete in the global market. The biggest employers\u2019 group Medef has long lobbied for its abolition as a way to entice more investment and job creation, as well as making French workers more competitive.\n\n\u201cHis program is very realistic, serious, for the business community,\u201d Pierre Gattaz, the head of Medef, said in an interview Monday with Bloomberg Radio in Paris. Now he needs to convince voters, and especially organized labor, and \u201cwe\u2019ll help him explain that to the unions.\u201d\n\nDuring a televised debate on Thursday, Fillon said the law has \u201cdone a lot of damage\u201d and must come to an end.\n\n\u201cIn some companies, skilled workers are rare and it\u2019s a pity to see people leave after 35 hours when they could have worked longer,\u201d said Francois Asselin, head of the French business lobby for small and medium-sized companies known as CGPME. \u201cWhen business is dynamic and the outlook is good, yes, we would like to be able to work longer.\u2019\u2019\n\nCorporate Leaders\n\nOne sector looking to Fillon for answers is the country\u2019s highly-competitive telecom industry, in which four mobile operators have engaged in cut-throat price wars for the past five years. As minister in charge of telecommunications in the 1990s, Fillon laid the groundwork for the privatization of former monopoly France Telecom, which is now called Orange SA. As prime minister a decade later, he worked toward a further opening of the mobile market in 2012 by allowing Iliad SA to have a license.\n\nTelecom operators want a framework to encourage investment, ensure fair taxation and regulation for all operators and many of Fillon\u2019s proposals show he is aware of these issues, said Michel Combot, managing director of the French telecommunications industry association called the Federation Francaise des Telecoms.\n\nSome prominent French corporate leaders have gravitated around Fillon. Former Axa SA Chief Executive Officer Henri de Castries accompanied Fillon on a New York fund-raising trip this year, while Total SA Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne was Fillon\u2019s chief of staff when he was information, technology and space minister in 1995 and 1996. Pouyanne didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nLabor Laws\n\nNot all of Fillon\u2019s policies are being applauded by business representatives. He is proposing to cut around half a million civil servant jobs as well as raise France\u2019s value-added tax by 2 percentage points to 22 percent . These measures could weigh on the French consumption, according to Pierre Boucheny, head of French Equity Research for Kepler Cheuvreux.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nFillon has said he plans to loosen labor laws to make it easier for French companies to hire and fire workers. He has also promised to lower employer contributions. These measures would benefit firms working in France, especially in construction, infrastructure and IT services, according to analysts including Frederic Jamet, head of investment at State Street Global Advisors France. Private companies could also benefit from Fillon\u2019s plan for 12 billion euros in extra spending over fives years on defense, justice and the police.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want excessive measures, but something simple, clear and lasting,\u201d said Jean-Francois Buet, chairman of France\u2019s largest residential property-broker federation known as FNAIM.\n\nWatch Next: Is Fillon the Man to Save France From the Far Right?", "date": "2016-11-28 00:00:00", "title": "France Inc.

Trouble is, they\u2019re not the solution to all needs.\n\nAs well as the environmental impact of mining lithium, which has been blamed for starving flamingos in northern Chile, batteries lose their charge over time. They can balance minute-to-minute shifts in supply. But they can't absorb solar power generated in summer, say, and deliver it in winter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need a whole range of solutions to keep the lights on,\u201d said Michael Liebreich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \u201cIf your problem is that the sun doesn\u2019t shine in winter, are you really going to buy a battery, charge it once a year during summer and use it once a year in winter? I don\u2019t think so. You can\u2019t just jump to batteries as the single solution.\u201d\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nStorage devices are crucial to expanding the wind and solar industries and curtailing pollution because they allow what\u2019s generated now to be consumed later. Just as refrigeration changed the way we handled food in the 20th century, energy storage will give grid operators and rooftop-solar consumers flexibility about when to use the power they produce -- reducing the number of big power plants the world needs.\n\nHere's the leading energy storage projects on the drawing board that go beyond lithium-ion batteries:\n\nHydropower\n\nLong before batteries, electricity was stored through plants that pump water uphill to a reservoir and release it through turbines when it\u2019s needed. It\u2019s long-lived enough to hold solar power generated in the summer for use in the winter. Hydropower is renewable energy\u2019s oldest technology and accounts for well over 90 percent of energy storage, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nAs well as classic hydroelectric stations, tidal lagoons may also offer energy storage in a similar way by holding water for short periods, according to Tidal Lagoon Power Ltd., which is planning to build six lagoons around the U.K. coast line.\n\nRailpower\n\nTrains can double as storage. In April, Advanced Rail Energy Storage won approval from the Nevada Bureau of Land Management for a $55 million project using rail locomotives.\n\nARES will build a 6-mile uphill rail corridor involving heavily-loaded trains. When power\u2019s cheap, trains will be pushed up a hill. When the power is needed, they\u2019ll be released down, supplying energy back to the grid through an overhead wire.\n\nChief Executive Officer Jim Kelly reckons the system can be deployed at about 60 percent of the cost of an equivalent pumped-hydro facility. The nine-month construction program is expected to start in the second quarter of 2017. Once complete, it could run for 40 years.\n\nAir storage\n\nCompressed air storage sequesters a gas underground so it can be released later to drive a generation turbine whenever needed.\n\nOne project in Toronto sends the air underwater where it\u2019s stored in balloons. When demand for power rises, the air comes back to the surface through a pipe, where it\u2019s converted into electricity.\n\nCompressed air storage requires a specific type of rock formation. The world has a handful of existing projects -- one in Huntorf, Germany and another in McIntosh, Alabama. Several large scale projects have been put on ice, including the Iowa Stored Energy Plant near Des Moines and Dresser-Rand Group\u2019s 317-megawatt Apex Bethel Energy Center in Anderson County, Texas.\n\nPower-to-gas\n\nCompanies including carmaker Audi are developing power-to-gas technology that turns excess energy into hydrogen using electrolysis. The hydrogen can be directly injected into a gas network, or \u201cupgraded\u201d into methane and used as a substitute for natural gas.\n\nSiemens, the world\u2019s biggest power-equipment maker, is working on an approach that turns hydrogen into a clean ammonia, that could potentially provide emissions-free fertilizer that could be used by farmers everywhere.\n\nAdvocates say it can deliver both long and short-term back up power since the gas can be trapped indefinitely. That means it can shift electricity made in summer for use in the winter. It isn\u2019t yet clear whether the economics will stack up.\n\nFlywheels\n\nFlywheels look nothing like a traditional battery. Think of a spinning drum that stores the kinetic energy in a way that can be made into electricity. Power is used to start the wheel turning. Then when electricity is in short supply, the flywheel turns a motor that generates electricity. They can deliver either short bursts or for longer periods.\n\nRailway Technical Research Institute, a Tokyo-based developer of railroad technologies, is working on a flywheel that uses superconducting magnetic bearings that allow the wheel to spin with less friction. Its system also uses a plastic that\u2019s reinforced with carbon fiber, making the flywheel stronger and faster. The bearings allow the flywheel to float without making contact with its housing, reducing energy lost through friction.\n\nRailway Technical is developing the flywheel technology with Furukawa Electric Co. and Mirapro Co. They have set up a flywheel system at a 1-megawatt solar park in Japan\u2019s Yamanashi prefecture. Temporal Power Ltd. and Beacon Power Corp. are also pursuing flywheel systems.\n\nWatch Next: Elon Musk Asks Workers to Cut Costs", "date": "2016-09-08 00:00:00", "title": "These Technologies May Actually Deliver Elon Musk\u2019s Dream of Changing the World"}

His remarks were also streamed to EPA\u2019s 15,000-strong workforce nationwide.\n\nPruitt decried a deeply politicized environment that he said creates obstacles to finding effective solutions. \"We deal with very important, monumental issues with respect to our future,\" he said. \"We can do better as a country.\"\n\nPerhaps more than any other member of Trump\u2019s cabinet, Pruitt is at odds with the agency he now leads. He built his political career fighting federal regulations he said stripped power away from states, and as Oklahoma attorney general, joined more than a dozen lawsuits challenging EPA actions by the Obama administration. He also appeared to relish his role as the agency\u2019s chief antagonist; an online biography dubbed Pruitt \"a leading advocate against the EPA\u2019s activist agenda.\"\n\nStill, Pruitt has taken pains to emphasize that environmental regulation and economic development can go hand in hand.\n\nIn a nearly 12-minute speech that avoided addressing substantive details of EPA policy, Pruitt outlined a \"cooperative federalism\" approach that gives states a larger role in collaborating with the EPA on environmental matters. Pruitt said he wanted to engender trust among state regulators and carefully follow congressional dictates to write new federal rules that are tethered to the statutes that compel them.\n\n\"We need to be open and transparent and objective in how we do rulemaking and make sure we follow the letter of the law as we do so because that would send, I think, a great message to those who are regulated,\" Pruitt said. \"They want to know what\u2019s expected of them.\"\n\nPruitt sought to soothe unease among the agency\u2019s rank and file, with remarks that were measured and focused on process -- far from the bombastic declarations about slashing EPA staff and overhauling its use of science made by former Trump advisers.\n\nNow Pruitt is trying to convince EPA employees that by focusing on core functions, the agency can do a better job keeping pollution out of the air and cleaning toxic chemicals from old industrial sites.\n\nAs administrator, Pruitt is positioned to undo some of the same agency regulations he challenged in court, including the Clean Power Plan that slashes greenhouse gas emissions from electricity and the Waters of the U.S. rule that defined which waterways are subject to pollution regulation. Trump administration officials have drafted documents directing Pruitt to begin dismantling those measures, helping fulfill Trump\u2019s pledge to eviscerate rules the president has said throttle U.S. energy development.\n\nSome conservatives also are pressing Pruitt to go further and undo the legal underpinning for many Obama-era environmental rules by questioning the scientific basis for them.\n\nPruitt\u2019s efforts will face internal opposition from an agency that made combating climate change its top priority over the past few years.\n\nScores of EPA scientists, experts and lawyers actively fought Pruitt\u2019s nomination, beseeching senators to vote against him and organizing opposition via social media. The union representing agency employees launched an online campaign against Pruitt\u2019s agenda under the headline, \"Save the EPA.\" Nearly 800 former EPA officials also signed a letter opposing Pruitt\u2019s nomination.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nIf Pruitt asks the agency\u2019s career civil servants to make 180-degree pivots on policy, he may have a hard time getting them to go along, said Kevin Book, managing director of the Washington-based research firm ClearView Energy Partners. It may take years for frustrated civil servants to walk out the door of an agency for good, but in the meantime, they can walk much slower inside it, Book said in an interview.\n\n\"You don\u2019t get an environmental scientist going to work at the EPA for the privilege of helping to drill more wells,\" Book said. \"They\u2019re bound by all of the professional responsibilities and limitations that are imposed by their employer, but they are a force to be reckoned with.\"\n\nSigns of that resistance have already appeared, with current and former employees setting up Twitter accounts to highlight perceived abuses.\n\nMany agency employees are veterans of presidential transitions and know their fealty is to U.S. law, said Jeff Holmstead, a top EPA official under former President George W. Bush.\n\n\"There is a minority -- and I really do think it\u2019s a relatively small number -- of people at EPA who believe their mission is more important than their obligation to the law,\" Holmstead, a partner at Bracewell LLP, said. That opposition can feed leaks to Congress, the press and the public, he said.\n\nPruitt spoke Tuesday in the Rachel Carson Green Room, named for a noted marine biologist whose work highlighting the dangers of widespread pesticide use helped drive a global environmental movement.\n\n\"You can\u2019t lead, unless you listen,\" Pruitt said, promising to do just that as administrator.", "date": "2017-02-21 00:00:00", "title": "EPA Chief Woos Staff Skeptical of Tilt to Pro-Energy Mission"}

Last November, it had forecast slight growth at best. Sanofi shares fell as much as 5.3 percent, the biggest drop in more than two months.\n\nChief Executive Officer Olivier Brandicourt is banking on new therapies such as Praluent, a powerful new cholesterol treatment that first went on sale in July, and Aubagio and Lemtrada for multiple sclerosis, to help make up for the sales slide in ageing best-sellers like Lantus.

That exceeded the 1.58-euro average of 12 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nLantus Rebates\n\nLantus, which lost patent protection earlier this year, saw overall sales drop 11 percent at constant currencies as Eli Lilly & Co. introduced a cheaper generic rival in Europe. In the U.S., where revenue slid 20 percent, Sanofi was forced to offer insurers bigger rebates, it sold more to government channels such as Medicaid and found that demand for injected insulin overall had weakened as more patients turned to new oral alternatives.\n\n\u201cWe conducted a detailed scenario analysis and arrived at what we consider to be a realistic range,\u201d Brandicourt said on a conference call.

Instead of increasing production to 500,000 cars in 2020, he wants to reach that level by 2018. To put that into perspective, Tesla delivered just 50,658 cars in 2015 and is projecting 80,000 this year. The company acknowledged the scale of the challenge in an Aug. 5 Securities and Exchange Commission filing: \u201cWe have no experience to date in manufacturing vehicles at the high volumes that we anticipate for Model 3, and to be successful, we will need to develop efficient, automated, low-cost manufacturing capabilities, processes, and supply chains necessary to support such volumes.\u201d\n\nMusk has referred to his factories\u2014the auto plant in Fremont, Calif., and one for batteries going up in Reno, Nev.\u2014as the \u201cmachine that builds the machine.\u201d But with only 10 months to go before the self-imposed July 1, 2017, deadline for the start of Model 3 mass production, the machine that will build the new car is still being built. About 373,000 customers have already paid $1,000 to preorder the electric sedan.\n\nThe Fremont factory employs more than 5,000 workers and, like most auto plants, has four main shops: stamping, body, paint, and general assembly. A stamping die is a precision tool that cuts and forms metals into car parts such as door panels, hoods, fenders, and roofs. All the stamped parts for the Model S and Model X are made in Fremont. The Model 3 stamping line will be entirely new but hasn\u2019t been installed yet.\n\nThe new body line, where the stamped pieces are welded together, hasn\u2019t materialized either.

The Japanese company Fanuc, the world\u2019s largest maker of industrial robots, already has about 600 robots at Tesla\u2019s Fremont plant, a number that will grow for Model 3 production.

With the benefits encouraging those with multiple children to drop out of the workforce, the pool of available employees, already limited by about 2 million Poles living abroad, may shrink further if the government carries out its promise to cut the retirement age as soon as next year.\n\nLabor Shortage?\n\n\u201cIn the long-run, child benefits may trigger the deactivation of a large part of the workforce, further straining the already small pool of available labor,\u201d said Grzegorz Baczewski, an economist at Lewiatan. \u201cIt will also become a social issue as many people may not be able to return to the labor market when their entitlement expires.\u201d\n\nEmployers working in industries ranging from agriculture to tourism, retail and construction are struggling to fill vacant jobs this summer amid a seasonal pickup of activity, Lewiatan\u2019s Baczewski said.

It may propose increasing risk weights for foreign-currency mortgages, which will effectively impose higher capital demands on those banks that hold them. Currently, risk weighting for such assets stands at 100 percent in Poland, well above the 35 percent level in the European Union, according to the Polish financial market watchdog.\n\nWhile the plan is \u201cfundamental\u201d for the nation\u2019s financial stability, it also gives lenders \u201ctime and room for active management of the currency risk to gradually mitigate it,\u201d Zdzislaw Sokal, a member of the Financial Stability Committee, said in an interview on Monday.\n\nThe most important market news of the day.

Photographer: John Guillemin/Bloomberg\n\nHere\u2019s a guide to some of the key issues at play in Sunday\u2019s vote:\n\nPeople Seem Fed Up With Civic Platform\n\nThe party founded by former Prime Minister Donald Tusk has been in power since November 2007. He upped sticks last year to become president of the European Council after leading it to unprecedented back-to-back victories. The perception now is that the party has lost touch with voters outside Warsaw and Poland\u2019s richer western regions. It\u2019s also paying a price for a scandal last year involving tapes of officials talking rather too candidly over lavish dinners.\n\nThe Opposition Is Back in Favor\n\nVoters are turning back to Law and Justice. The party, founded by former child actors Lech and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, is leading polls by as much as 17 percentage points.\n\nFormer Polish President Lech Kaczynski died in a plane crash five years ago. While his twin brother still pulls the strings in the party, the Law & Justice candidate for prime minister is Beata Szydlo, making it an all-female contest against incumbent PM Ewa Kopacz of Civic Platform.\n\nSmaller Parties Are Important\n\nLike in most of Poland\u2019s eight previous post-1989 general elections, smaller parties have emerged that just might cross the 5 percent threshold to enter parliament. Despite its lead, a majority for Law & Justice would be a surprisingly emphatic victory, so newer political faces are worth watching for.\n\nThere are five groups on the threshold, ranging from an anti-establishment movement led by rock musician Pawel Kukiz to a party led by an economist preaching the gospel of austerity and free markets.\n\nA Law & Justice Win Could Spook Banks and Markets\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nThe makeup of the next government is key to how financial markets react to the exit poll and early results on Sunday night. A survey of economists by Bloomberg showed the biggest concern for Poland\u2019s currency, the zloty, would be an outright majority for Law & Justice. That would enable the party to keep its spending promises, hit banks with new taxes and potentially be more of a wildcard for foreign investors.\n\nThe White Eagle, the national emblem of Poland, hangs at the entrance to the central bank of Poland in Warsaw, Poland. John Guillemin/Bloomberg\n\nPoland Is Nervous About Russia \u2013 and Refugees\n\nFinally, a change of government in Poland comes at a pivotal time for European foreign policy and history shows how sandwiched the country is between east and west.

Writing satirical articles for more than 220,000 fans, she won backing from an investor and quit her public-relations job.\n\nThen it all came tumbling down. Internet authorities shut down her blog, called Shameless China, with no warning. It happened just after she posted an article mocking Chinese men\u2019s hairstyles, including former President Jiang Zemin\u2019s slick-backed coiffure.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t dawn on me how serious the situation was,\u201d Lian said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I was never getting back this account and all my followers.\u201d\n\nLian\u2019s story underscores how precarious the world of blogging remains for many writers in China. Well-known bloggers have been jailed and shamed on national TV. Qin Zhihui, a well-known author on social-media platform Weibo, was sentenced to three years in prison for publishing false information to drive web traffic. A 2013 missive by the Supreme People\u2019s Court and top national prosecutor effectively criminalized defamatory web posts that are read by more than 5,000 people, reposted more than 500 times or caused people to hurt themselves.\n\nAs one of the 20 million official accounts operating on Tencent Holdings Ltd.\u2019s WeChat, Lian\u2019s account stood out for its blunt and edgy humor about Chinese and expatriate stereotypes. WeChat, which had 762.4 million monthly active users at the end of March, is a mobile app that blends chats, blogging, shopping, digital wallets and other smartphone apps.\n\nEven before she started Shameless, Lian knew censorship was an issue. China polices and aggressively scrubs online content deemed undesirable or a threat to society, from violence and pornography to anti-government commentary. Tencent said in May that it deleted 85,000 rumor articles and that 7,000 accounts were punished for violating regulations \u201cto maintain a healthy internet environment.\u201d\n\nCanny Lo, a spokeswoman for Tencent, didn\u2019t respond to an e-mail and text message seeking comment.\n\nAs a 26-year-old Beijing resident who often crossed paths with the Chinese and expat community, Lian had an keen eye for spotting gaffes and irksome traits from both camps. She didn\u2019t think a light-hearted column about her community\u2019s foibles would offend sensitivities, so she started with a story in April of last year about \u201c the eight types of foreigners in Beijing,\u201d covering hipsters to foreign bankers.\n\nAfter reading it, a friend told her, \u201cnot everyone is as shameless as you are,\u201d Lian said. Because her last name has a pronunciation similar to the Chinese word for face -- \u201cI said, shameless? That\u2019s so me!\u201d -- her blog was born.\n\nLian went on to write stories about different types of Chinese girlfriends, boyfriends, how to drink with Chinese people, and Lunar New Year survival strategies. Many attracted more than 1 million clicks from readers.\n\n\u201cThe blog wasn\u2019t intended to be serious, what I wanted was to humor people and then if they realized that these perceptions existed and that people saw things differently that would be great,\u201d Lian said.\n\nShameless China also attracted plenty of angry comments, with people telling her to stop writing about China or leave if she wasn\u2019t happy about life in Beijing. Still, the blog prospered, with advertisers for brands, events and parties approaching her and asking her to post their articles. Lian would earn commissions based on readership, making almost 50,000 yuan ($7,478) a month during good times.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world.

About 20 were able to attract funding of more than 10 million yuan each in the 20 months up to March this year, according to Beijing-based mobile-app researcher TalkingData. Those included cyber celebrity Papi Jiang, who raised 12 million yuan from investors including Zhen Fund. By backing such bloggers, the funds are seeking to participate in their future endeavors.\n\n\u201cGood content creators are hard to come by and what we look for are people who are good at learning and adapting,\u201d said Liu Yuan, an investment manager at Zhen Fund, which backed both Lian and Papi Jiang. \"Investing in content is the same as investing into any business, it\u2019s the all about the people.\"\n\nBusiness was booming, until Lian published her article with the picture of China\u2019s former president. The story attracted numerous comments and close to 100,000 clicks. But within hours, all her stories were deleted and she was notified that her account was frozen because it had violated certain laws and regulations.\n\n\u201cI knew that when it comes to political leaders, it might be sensitive,\u201d Lian said. \u201cBut I never thought it would be this serious because my article was just about his hairstyle and it was in English.\u201d\n\nLian followed WeChat\u2019s instructions and filed a letter of explanation within the 100-word limit. A week later she got a curt response: \u201cwas not approved.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if you shut down my account, give me a clear reason,\u201d Lian said. \u201cDon\u2019t give me a page full of regulations and laws. I don\u2019t even know which rule I violated.\u201d\n\nDespite the setback, Lian is back with a new blog called ShamelessPlus. She\u2019s also thinking of branching out across different platforms such as Weibo, Tumblr and video sites. Still, Lian has only managed to attract less than 10,000 fans after a month.\n\n\u201cGetting all my fans back is turning out to be much harder than I imagined,\u201d Lian said. \u201cBut I already lost 220,000 fans, why would I fear losing just a few thousand?\u201d\n\nWatch Next: Why Facebook Is Jealous of Chinese Messaging App WeChat", "date": "2016-07-17 00:00:00", "title": "$7,000-a-Month \u2018Shameless China\u2019 Blogger Loses All With One Post"}

Some other changes -- such as the disappearance of climate change pages from the White House website -- reflect the shift in priorities from former President Barack Obama to Trump. In the meantime, the EPA has maintained a climate change section on its website, including a set of \u201c frequently asked questions\u201d about the phenomenon.\n\nPublic Studies\n\n\u201cThe way to clear the air about what the EPA is doing -- and what the state of our environment is -- is to reform the use of science so they have to use publicly available studies that can be replicated, that can be criticized,\u201d Ebell said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll find out the condition of the environment was a whole lot better than we\u2019ve been told.\u201d\n\nThe most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.\n\nEbell pointed to a 1993 landmark air pollution study conducted by Harvard University\u2019s School of Public Health that paved the way for more stringent regulations on air pollution by linking fine particulate matter to mortality risk. The underlying data from that federally funded research, known as the Six Cities Study, was never publicly released because its participants were promised confidentiality, according to the university.\n\n\u201cDuring this administration, we\u2019ll have to fight harder than ever to defend basic facts and science,\u201d Dani Heffernan, a spokeswoman for the environmental group 350.org said in an e-mail. \u201cWhat Ebell calls \u2018junk science\u2019 is the research helping set policies to protect our communities and our climate.\u201d\n\n\u2018Alternative Facts\u2019\n\nEbell singled out a stringent new smog standard imposed under Obama limiting ground-level ozone pollution to 70 parts per billion, down from the Bush-era level of 75 parts per billion. There is no public health distinction between those two levels, but the economic impacts are enormous, Ebell said.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at the costs of these regulations and the health benefits of destroying jobs,\u201d Ebell said.\n\nA former EPA staff member disagreed with that analysis.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like Myron Ebell has been reading some alternative facts,\u201d said Liz Purchia, who served as an acting associate administrator in the agency during the Obama administration. \u201cHe is going to need to provide a legal and scientific justification for redoing the agency\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nThe government is doing more damage to Americans\u2019 health by killing the jobs that pay their bills, Ebell said. Once you look at it that way, he said, the smog standard \u201cnot only has no health benefit, it has a very large health harm.\u201d\n\n\u2018Hostile Takeovers\u2019\n\nThe EPA is swollen with too many people, far beyond what\u2019s now necessary to protect public health and the environment, he said. \u201cMost of EPA\u2019s work in terms of protecting the public health and the environment has been accomplished,\u201d but career scientists employed there and \u201cthe special interests that depend upon them\u201d aren\u2019t ready to \u201cdeclare victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an expert in downsizing agencies, but I think the Trump Cabinet has people in it who are good at hostile takeovers. Maybe they should be consulted,\u201c Ebell quipped, noting that billionaire investor Carl Icahn is a special regulatory adviser to the new president.\n\nTrump understands the EPA \u201ccan be a huge obstacle\u201d to economic development, Ebell said.", "date": "2017-01-27 00:00:00", "title": "Trump Adviser Calling for Overhaul of \u2018Junk Science\u2019 at EPA"}

Party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said the same day he\u2019s aiming to gain full control of the legislature, which would allow him to push through policies to lower the retirement age, raise social spending and transform Poland\u2019s economy into one based on \u201chigher wages and innovation.\u201d\n\nPoland\u2019s election could be a watershed in what\u2019s become a momentous year for European politics, as voters decide whether to continue along a path charted in Brussels and Berlin or take a different tack. In parts of southern Europe, the focus has been on sacrificing economic sovereignty to stay in the euro. In some countries in the former communist east, it\u2019s about reasserting control over national identity, borders and finances -- all major campaign themes for Law & Justice.\n\n\u201cKaczynski has been able to activate more traditional voters, and his triumph is almost certain,\u201d Anna Materska-Sosnowska, a political scientist at Warsaw University, said on Thursday. \u201cEven if they don\u2019t win a majority, they will be only a few votes short, which will allow them to form a government without much difficulty.\u201d\n\nParasites, Cholera\n\nKaczynski opposes allowing migrants into Poland, and is instead offering to provide humanitarian aid abroad. A former prime minister, he warned Poles this week that migrants may be carrying illnesses that might hurt the country.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen the emergence of dangerous illnesses long absent in Europe; cholera on the Greek isles, dysentery in Vienna, various types of parasites inside these people,\u201d Kaczynski told reporters on Monday. \u201cSuch things may be harmful here.\u201d\n\nHis stance contrasts with that of the government, which says Poland must take part in German-led efforts to redistribute migrants fleeing from the Middle East and North Africa among the EU\u2019s 28 members. Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz agreed to take in about 12,000, but the number may rise as more refugees enter the bloc. The tougher rhetoric on migrants by Law & Justice appears to be winning over Poles after surveys only last week showed the opposition party falling short of a majority in the next parliament.\n\nForeign Minister Grzegorz Schetyna hardened the government\u2019s stance on refugees in an interview with RMF FM radio on Friday, calling German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s plan to divide up future waves of migrants between EU nations \u201cabsurd\u201d with potentially \u201ccatastrophic consequences for Europe.\u201d\n\nPoland is undergoing a political shift after the Civic Platform\u2019s eight-year rule, during which the country\u2019s $548 billion economy was the only one in the EU to avoid recession. Voters, concerned about job prospects and lured by spending promises, elected Law & Justice\u2019s Andrzej Duda as president in May, spooking financial markets.\n\nBond Performance\n\nLaw & Justice\u2019s economic policies may again inflate the country\u2019s budget deficit, which this year is set to drop below 3 percent of gross domestic product for the first time since 2007. Such risks are making Polish bonds underperform regional peers, with the nation\u2019s local-currency debt returning 1.1 percent since Aug. 30, compared with 1.4 percent for Hungary and 1.8 percent the Czech Republic, according to Bloomberg indexes.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day.

The TNS Polska poll for daily Fakt has Law & Justice at 38.9 percent with 239 seats, and Civic Platform at 30.1 percent with 182 seats.

Perhaps it will when someone else is in charge?\u201d\n\nPoland\u2019s economic growth and relatively little debt are something to envy if you\u2019re in the euro region. It\u2019s expanded 24 percent during the eight years the Civic Platform government has been in power compared with less than 1 percent for the European Union on average.

It says it will deliver the change voters want by standing up for Poles at home and abroad. That includes spending more on social security, taxing banks and winning support for a greater NATO presence on Polish soil to form a buffer zone in the region against Russia.\n\nLaw & Justice has kept the campaign focused on scandals, including secretly-taped discussions of senior officials over lavish diners, which it says highlights the government\u2019s detachment from issues that matter for ordinary Poles.\n\nShould polls prove correct, Poland would follow Canada in ditching a government that navigated the economy through a decade of turbulent times. The prospect of political upheaval also comes at an awkward time with the European Union more divided than at any time since former communist states joined in 2004. The Greek standoff over its future in the euro region exposed the rift between north and south, and now east is pitted against west over a refugee crisis and how to deal with a more assertive Russia.\n\nPolish Wildcard\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nIt could make Poland more of a wildcard for EU leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel as they try to maintain unity as Britain debates whether to stay in the bloc and Hungary shut borders to stem the flow of refugees. Civic Platform is a traditional Merkel ally and former Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who founded the party and led it unprecedented back-to-back election wins, is now president of the European Council.\n\n\u201cThe current government tries to locate Poland within the EU mainstream and not to be seen as an awkward partner: be nice to the big boys and you\u2019re likely to get your way,\u2019\u2019 said Aleks Szczerbiak, a professor of politics at the University of Sussex in England. . \u201cLaw & Justice would say this doesn\u2019t get you anywhere. What good does it do Poland? What are the benefits?\u2019\u2019\n\nThat uncertainty has also shown up in the bond market because of budget concerns. A gauge of government risk using five-year bond yields compared with expected interest rates surged to the highest level since 2012 last month before coming down. The premium of bonds over swaps stood at 30 basis points on Wednesday, 22 points above the four-year average.\n\nHow Polish political risk is viewed in the bond market.\n\nProsperity Divide\n\nThe mood in Brussels is that a Law & Justice government will be more cooperative than the election rhetoric might suggest and in Tusk the EU has someone who is used to the cut and thrust in Poland.\n\nWhen it comes to the economy, there\u2019s also little to divide Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz\u2019s governing Civic Platform and Law & Justice.\n\nBoth want to boost salaries -- more than a fifth of the population still makes less than the $720 a-month poverty threshold -- and lower the tax burden for families with children. Beata Szydlo, Law & Justice\u2019s candidate for premier, has made restoring a lower retirement age a key plank of its campaign as the rest of Europe increases it.\n\nThe divisions show up between the skyscrapers of Warsaw housing offices, banks and five-star hotels and the poorer east that buttresses Ukraine and Belarus, regions where Law & Justice derives its core support.\n\nPoland\u2019s economy burgeoned since the last change of power in 2007, thanks to $67 billion of EU aid. The debt crisis in the euro area led Poland to throw the brakes on joining neighboring Slovakia and the Baltic States in adopting the currency.\n\nUnemployment has dropped to 10 percent this year, the lowest level since 2008 and receding from a peak of 14.4 percent, though remains as high as 16 percent in the poorer northeast.

For many startups, a payout of that size would be a big setback. But some seasoned Uber drivers consider it a victory for the ride-hailing company.\n\nEzra Dubroff, an Uber driver in Los Angeles since November 2013, had hoped the case would go to trial and set a legal precedent. He and other drivers say the settlement folded on the suit's central claim\u2014that Uber drivers should be classified as employees, not independent contractors, entitled to such protections as a minimum wage, Social Security and health benefits.\n\nInstead, he says, the deal is being interpreted as a big win for Uber\u2014a contention widely shared by analysts who say the outcome is a significant boost for the company and the so-called gig economy. In the court of public opinion, Dubroff says, \"People think this is done with and that Uber is right.\"\n\nShannon Liss-Riordan, who represented about 385,000 drivers, defends the settlement as \"extremely significant\" and says she could have lost at trial in Uber's hometown of San Francisco. And even had she won, the company almost certainly would have appealed. \"I would have loved to take this case to trial,\" she says. \"Given the risks we were facing and what we achieved, that would not have been responsible.\"\n\n\n\nDrivers have already filed objections to the settlement, which the judge still needs to approve.\n\nNot all drivers are as disappointed as Dubroff. John Domingo, who estimates that he's driven more than 70,000 miles for Uber, believes an outright victory could have killed Uber's business if the company had been forced to convert its drivers into employees. But Domingo says, \"The attorney kind of sold out.\"\n\nSome drivers say Liss-Riordan should have held out for more money, which they consider a trifling sum for a company recently valued at $62.5 billion. Uber has agreed to pay an initial $84 million, which could rise to $100 million if the company goes public and reaches a valuation of at least $90 billion or so. How much each driver receives will depend, in part, on how many ask for a cut. If all do, based on a $100-million payout, Liss-Riordan estimates they'll get $1,950 apiece. (As much as a quarter of the settlement could be swallowed up by legal fees.)\n\nKendrick Lewallen signed up for Uber back in June of 2014. If he winds up receiving less than $2,000, he says, \"Uber basically won this lawsuit. If it's that low, I think it's kind of ridiculous because we've been working so hard and for so long. We deserve a little bit more.\"\n\nLiss-Riordan says the most active drivers could receive more than $8,000. But to get such a sum, they would have had to opt out of an arbitration clause recently added to their contracts. The clause excludes drivers from participating in class-action lawsuits.\n\nThe drivers won several non-monetary concessions from Uber. Chief among them: The company will no longer ban them for failing to accept new fares\u2014what the company calls deactivation.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\n\"As we\u2019ve grown we\u2019ve gotten a lot right\u2014but certainly not everything,\" Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick wrote in a blog post. \"This new deactivation policy is an important step forward when it comes to working with drivers. But there\u2019s more to do, which is why I\u2019m excited about some other improvements we have planned for the not too distant future. Stay tuned.\"\n\n\n\nAs part of the settlement, drivers also will be allowed to form an association. And Uber acknowledged it allows tipping, though gratuities aren't included in the mobile application.\n\n\n\nStill, according to Harry Campbell, who runs a popular blog for Uber drivers, the settlement \"really is a big win for Uber.

The company plans to localize the development and production of hybrid SUVs in the world\u2019s largest auto market, after introducing Corolla and Levin hybrid compact cars late last year.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nIn offering subsidies that have reached 114,000 yuan ($17,500) per vehicle for highly electrified vehicles and exempting them from license-plate restrictions in major cities, China has snubbed technology that Toyota and its Japanese peers have made mainstream in their domestic market. China\u2019s government is keen both to protect its local manufacturers and incentivize them to beat overseas competitors to achieving mass-market success with electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cThe precondition is that we don\u2019t have any incentives -- no support -- but still the customers want to select our cars,\u201d Shinichi said in an interview Sunday, ahead of China\u2019s biggest auto show opening this week in Beijing. \u201cWe need to develop cars that will meet that expectation. This is not just about the Chinese market -- we can\u2019t expect incentives from the government to continue forever.\u201d\n\nHybrid Sales\n\nSo far, the Corolla and Levin hybrids are holding their own without subsidies. Toyota has received orders for about 40,000 units. Its plants have been unable to keep up with that level of demand, building about 30,000 units since last year. Plug-in hybrid versions of the two models will begin selling in China from 2018.\n\nIn spite of the government turning a cold shoulder to the conventional hybrids embraced by their home market, Toyota, Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. each sold more than 1 million vehicles in China last year for the first time.\n\nThree years earlier, Japan\u2019s three largest automakers weathered annual sales declines as a territorial dispute with China prompted a consumer backlash. The clash helped open up the gulf between Japan\u2019s automakers and General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG, which each sold more than 3.5 million vehicles in China last year.\n\nGaining Momentum\n\nToyota is now gaining momentum after delivering a record 1.1 million vehicles in 2015. Sales jumped 28 percent to about 291,000 units during the first three months of this year.\n\nThe automaker plans to boost local production capacity by about 5.6 percent to 1.13 million units in the near term, adding assembly of one new model each at two plants run by joint ventures with China FAW Group and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. by mid-2018. Toyota will begin producing the C-HR compact SUV locally that year, Hiroji Onishi, the company\u2019s China chief, told reporters Sunday.\n\nToyota\u2019s hybrid sales may be even higher if China had included the technology for incentives and exemptions from license-plate and traffic restrictions.\n\nToyota shares rose as much as 1.8 percent in Tokyo trading and were 0.6 percent higher at 5,954 yen at 10:40 a.m. local time.\n\nLicense Plate\n\nDavid Yang, 34, would have bought the Toyota Levin hybrid if it qualified for a license plate in Beijing\u2019s lottery. Under the current system, electric cars are in a separate category that has a much higher chance of winning an ownership permit.\n\n\u201cHybrids save some fuel but they can\u2019t be classified as new-energy vehicles here to get the car plates without need of an auction,\u201d Yang said while browsing at a Toyota dealership in Beijing. \u201cI would\u2019ve bought the Levin hybrid if it wasn\u2019t for the car plate issue.\u201d\n\nBringing the C-HR and a hybrid version of RAV4 to China may help address a weakness within Toyota\u2019s local lineup. It trails many of its competitors in the SUV segment, which drove industry sales growth last year and has continued expanding into 2016.\n\nToyota has annual local production capacity for only about 100,000 RAV4s, its top-selling SUV model in China. By contrast, Great Wall Motor Co., the leader in SUV sales in China, delivered more than 370,000 Haval H6s last year, while Volkswagen\u2019s Tiguan sales exceeded 250,000 units.\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Yuki Hagiwara, and Craig Trudell", "date": "2016-04-24 00:00:00", "title": "Toyota Doubles Down on Hybrids Despite China's Subsidies Snub"}

In office for just five weeks, the 66-year-old economist wrested control from politicians on the main issue facing the country\u2019s banks -- how to safely unwind their $36 billion foreign-currency loan portfolio.\n\nStocks and the zloty rallied on Tuesday as investors bet Glapinski\u2019s approach will cost banks less than an earlier proposal to exchange mainly Swiss-franc mortgages into zloty. The governor said on Tuesday he\u2019s seeking a voluntary solution instead of forcing lenders, which already face the European Union\u2019s highest tax levies, into a costly and mandatory conversion.\n\nAdam Glapinski Source: Narodowy Bank Polski\n\n\u201cNow it will be the central bank and the regulator talking to banks about their Swiss mortgages,\u201d said Dariusz Gorski, an analyst at Bank Zachodni WBK SA. \u201cThis means less political interference, which gives investors a sense of comfort.\u201d\n\nPresident Andrzej Duda\u2019s proposal, announced on Tuesday, envisages a gradual conversion of mortgages triggered by regulatory changes as well as a draft law forcing lenders to pay back clients as much as 4 billion zloty ($1 billion) for \u201cexcessive\u201d exchange-rate spreads.

The zloty was little changed at 4.3233 against the euro, trading just below an eight-week high.\n\nGlapinski\u2019s Request\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nFixing the issue of foreign-currency loans has hung over Polish lenders and slowed consolidation after Duda made helping the country\u2019s 565,000 foreign-currency mortgage holders a key plank of his election campaign last year. Glapinski said he asked Duda to let the central bank take care of the issue to ensure the industry remains stable amid near-zero or negative global interest rates, a crisis in Italian banks and potential fallout from the U.K.\u2019s vote to leave the EU.\n\nRegulatory actions will \u201ctighten the screw on banks, if we think this is needed,\u201d Glapinski told reporters gathered at a Presidential palace in Warsaw. \u201cOur absolute priority is maintaining financial stability.\u201d\n\nPolish banks have plummeted twice as fast as emerging-market stocks, adjusted for currency swings, since Duda\u2019s election in May 2015, losing a quarter of their market value. The president\u2019s earlier Swiss-loan proposal would have cost the banks as much as 67 billion zloty, or about six years of the industry\u2019s profit, according to the regulator\u2019s estimate published in March.\n\n\u201cInvestors\u2019 enthusiasm is excessive,\u201d said Maciej Marcinowski, an analyst at Trigon Dom Malkerski SA brokerage. Loan-conversion costs could still amount to as much as 40 billion zloty and force lenders to limit dividends or even raise capital, he said by phone.\n\nRegulatory Trigger\n\nPoland is following other eastern European countries that moved to convert foreign-currency mortgages, which accumulated before the 2008 financial crisis as borrowers flocked to secure low interest rates. The zloty has lost half of its value against the franc in the past six years. That has made the value of more than half of such loans higher than that of the underlying property.\n\nDuda\u2019s plan, which will be sent to parliament within days, envisages banks returning funds to clients for currency spreads that deviated more than 0.5 percent from the central bank\u2019s daily fixing rate. The spread costs will be capped if the value of the loan exceeded 350,000 zloty.\n\nThe plan is \u201ctough, but manageable\u201d for banks, Krzysztof Pietraszkiewicz, head of the Polish lenders\u2019 lobby, said on Tuesday. He said it\u2019s good that the responsibility for the Swiss currency loan issue was shifted from politicians to regulators, who have \u201cconstitutional\u201d duty to protect the industry\u2019s stability.\n\nGlapinski said he will recommend that the country\u2019s financial regulator levy additional capital requirements on lenders with exposure to foreign currency loans to encourage them to convert their mortgages into zloty. Duda may resume work on a forced conversion after a one year evaluation, his adviser Maciej Lopinski said on Tuesday.\n\nKaczynski Ally\n\n\u201cGlapinski not only took upon himself the role of coming up with a solution, but also serves as the guarantor of its credibility,\u201d said Marta Petka-Zagajewski, the chief economist at Raiffeisen Polbank SA. \u201cAt the same time, Duda left himself a window to take back the political initiative, if banks fail to react appropriately.\u201d\n\nApproved by parliament for a six-year term at the helm of the National Bank of Poland in June, Glapinski is a long-time ally of Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of the ruling Law & Justice party and the most powerful man in Polish politics.\n\nGlapinski\u2019s \u201ccalmer and more pragmatic views,\u201d as well as the ability to resist the pull of old allegiances pushed the Swiss-loan debate in the right direction and triggered the market rally, according to Peter Attard Montalto, an economist at Nomura Plc in London.\n\n\u201cHe deserves some praise for shifting the balance - indeed, a month ago we were still convinced the plan would be more dramatic,\u201d Montalto said.", "date": "2016-08-02 00:00:00", "title": "Polish Banks Win Reprieve as Glapinski Grabs Swiss-Loan Role"}

The price of Polish banks compared to their book value slumped to a three-year low in September as lenders face political risks as well as record-low interest rates.\n\nHere are questions investors may have about what\u2019s ahead for Polish banks:\n\nQ: How bad is the Swiss-franc issue for Polish lenders?\n\nLike in other east European countries including Hungary and Croatia, mortgages in foreign currencies, mainly in francs and euros, were popular in Poland because they offered lower rates than zloty home loans. They became a pressing issue in January, when the Swiss central bank allowed the franc to surge, boosting payments for 565,000 Polish households. The zloty lost half of its value to the franc since a 2008 peak.\n\nSince then, politicians have been debating how to help one of the key middle-class electorates, while the banking regulator has been ringing alarm bells, saying that more than half of Poles\u2019 Swiss loans are worth more than the underlying property. About 38 percent of all mortgages are taken out in currencies other than the zloty, according to July data published by the country\u2019s financial-market watchdog.\n\nUnlike for other countries such as Hungary, Swiss-franc mortgages aren\u2019t a \u201cmacro\u201d challenge for Poland, even though there\u2019s \u201cobviously a social problem,\u201d Polish central bank Governor Marek Belka said in a speech to parliament in July.\n\nQ: What do politicians seek to do with Swiss-franc loans?\n\nThe ruling Civic Platform drafted legislation that would convert Swiss loans into zloty at the current rate, with the 19 billion-zloty cost split evenly between banks and borrowers. During work on the bill, Law & Justice and other parties changed the legislation to force banks to cover 90 percent of the costs, which effectively froze work on the measure until after the Oct. 25 general election.\n\nPresident Andrzej Duda said he will propose a solution to the Swiss loan issue to the next parliament.

The alternative transaction tax would generate revenues of as much as 1.7 billion zloty, according to its estimates, the party said the same day.\n\nThese plans risk hurting credit growth, banking jobs and may hobble the country\u2019s financial markets, according the ACI Polska association of financial-market professionals.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day.

But this would come at a cost to the entire Polish financial industry and the people employed there, while budget revenues would be much smaller than now envisaged.\u201d\n\nMost exposed are Bank Handlowy SA, with 24 percent of revenue from trading activities, Bank Zachodni with 14 percent, Alior Bank SA with 13 percent, as well as MBank and Bank Pekao, both with 11 percent.\n\nQ: Politicians want to \u201cre-Polonize\u201d banks, is this realistic?\n\nOnly three of the 10 biggest Polish lenders are controlled by Poles.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-21/tesla-changed-cars-forever-now-it-must-deliver", "sourcename": "bloomberg", "response_body": "It was the night of the unveiling. Nineteen minutes into his big talk, Elon Musk finally revealed what everyone had come to see. Three of Tesla Motor Inc.\u2019s Model 3 prototypes rolled onto stage. But it was the next revelation that brought the house down: Tesla had already taken in more than 115,000 reservations that day, each with a $1,000 deposit\u2014sight unseen. The crowd swooned. The media roared.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, reservations jumped to about 400,000\u2014almost four times the total number of cars Tesla has produced over the last eight years. As the dust settles on this achievement\u2014an affordable, practical, desirable electric car\u2014we\u2019ve been pulling together data to put it in historical context. The 10 charts below show how much Tesla's new metal box with wheels may change our world, but they also show how everything else needs to go exactly right if that's going to happen.\n\nThe Model 3's unveiling was unique in the 100-year history of the mass-market automobile. The closest analog is that of the 1955 Citroen DS, which took in 80,000 deposits over 10-days at the Paris Auto Show. Much like the Model 3, the DS was lauded as an engineering marvel that was years ahead of its time. A more recent parallel among technological sensations is Apple Inc.'s iPhone:\n\nThe Model 3 represents the first time an affordable electric car doesn\u2019t have to apologize for running on batteries. Conventional wisdom once held that electric cars would always run slow and would never be objects of automotive lust. Tesla flipped that on its head by clocking some of the fastest times from 0 to 60 miles per hour in the world with its Model S. The cheaper Model 3 is no slouch, either:\n\nAffordable? Check. Desirable? Check. But how far can you go before having to charge it again? That's always been a foundational question. Could this upstart really make a long-range car with the grace of the Model S\u2014and deliver it at a reasonable price? Apparently, yes. The Model 3 offers the cheapest range available for any electric car, even though it retains some of the richest features. In the long run, this may be one of the most important contributions of the car, if it is to bring the electric automobile fully into the mass market.\n\nBattery cost makes up a third of the price of an electric vehicle\u2014a fact that hasn't been lost on Tesla. The company has been throwing a lot of its sweat and money at cutting this expense\u2014including building the biggest battery factory on the planet and launching a standalone battery-storage business. The strategy seems to be working: Tesla is now making finished battery packs at or below $220 per kilowatt hour, considerably less than the industry average, according to analysts at Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF). If Tesla can shave an additional 30 percent off its battery cost, it should be able to sell the Model 3 with a healthy 20 percent gross profit margin.\n\nTesla is also expanding range by eking more miles out of the same electricity. Musk said on Twitter that he thinks the final Model 3 will have a drag coefficient of 0.21. That would make it one of the sleekest cars ever sold:\n\nBut even a long-range battery dies, and what happens then?\n\nAs it turns out, charging isn't as big a hurdle as many drivers imagine. Sure, there are still roughly 13 gas stations for every public charging location. But that's ignoring the most common type of charging station of all: your garage. About two-thirds of U.S. homes have them. With an at-home charger and 215 miles of range, most customers rarely need to stop at a charging station. Looking at it that way, charging locations already outnumber gas stations by about 400 to 1.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nPublic charging stations are primarily needed for drivers who spend long stretches on the road at a time\u2014be it for road trips or business travel. For most of these drivers, it's the speed of the chargers\u2014not the absolute number\u2014that matters most, so Tesla is focusing on building a charging network with the fastest chargers in the world. Tesla Superchargers can provide 170 miles of driving range in 30 minutes, and owners of the Model X and S can use them all without charge. The number of Superchargers will double this year alone, according to Tesla.\n\nSo Tesla has the right chargers and it has the right car. The sky is the limit, right? Well, here is the biggest hurdle the company faces between now and the electric-car filled horizon: follow-through. First Tesla has to make all those Model 3s on order, and this is a company that's known for delays. The chart below shows each of Tesla's unveilings and the forecast for delivery Musk provided when he began taking reservations. Every car missed its deadline, most recently with the Model X overshooting by more than 18 months. Did we mention that those $1,000 deposits on the Model 3 are fully refundable?\n\nTesla can no longer afford such delays, for several reasons:\n\nPreviously Tesla relied on wealthy early adopters who weren't in a rush. Many Model 3 buyers don't have that luxury. The backlog of 400,000 reservations will probably grow before the launch slated for late next year. Even if it doesn't, this is a considerable number of cars to move. Delays for some in the queue are inevitable, but how long will buyers wait? The competition is arriving soon. General Motors Co.'s Chevy Bolt is already going to beat Tesla to market with an electric car that can drive 200 miles on a charge for less than $40,000. While the Bolt doesn't share the panache of a Model 3, it's a practical option for electric-car buyers, and the luxury brands aren't far behind. Perhaps most pressing for Tesla is that the $7,500 U.S. subsidy for electric cars, which brings the base Model 3 price to $27,500, is going to expire.\n\nEverything must go right for the Model 3 to succeed: The battery factory must flourish, costs must come down, car-manufacturing capacity must scale at an astonishing rate, and all of it needs to arrive on time. Musk says he can sell 500,000 cars a year by 2020 worldwide. Here's what the U.S. Tesla market would need to look like in order for that to happen:\n\nThe high price of the Model S and Model X will put a cap on their total potential market, according to BNEF. In order for Tesla to meet its 2020 forecast, it will need to make up the difference with the rapid deployment of the Model 3. In fact, Tesla may need to sell more units than the class-leading BMW 3 Series.\n\nAlmost every major automaker\u2014as well as tech companies such as Google Inc. and Apple\u2014has an electric-car program that\u2019s moving ahead with new urgency. In addition to GM's effort, Ford Motor Co. is investing billions of dollars in its program and even paid $200,000 for an early Tesla Model X, presumably so it could tear it apart.\n\nCompetition from Detroit and abroad could spell trouble for Tesla, but it's also necessary if electric cars are to replace the internal combustion engine. Being any later to this party will only hurt Tesla.\n\nEarlier this year, BNEF analysts and I made some predictions about how quickly electric automobiles could begin to supplant gasoline-powered cars and upend oil markets. It was seen by some at the time as being overly optimistic for the electric-car industry. But after looking at the anticipated specs and timeline of the Model 3, some the assumptions are beginning to look, if anything, a little bit conservative.\n\n\n\nTesla can take credit for blowing the whole thing open, but it will have to keep up its remarkable pace to stay in the game.", "date": "2016-04-21 00:00:00", "title": "Ten Charts That Will Make You Rethink Tesla's Model 3"}

Online video operator Youku Tudou Inc., which was acquired by Alibaba, and budget hotel chain Homeinns Hotel Group were delisted from U.S. last week.\n\nWhile 40 Chinese companies have received offers to delist from American exchanges over the last year, only seven have completed the process. Opinions about where the trend is headed are split. One school of thought is that the stock market rout in China and increasing policy uncertainty have made a local listing less attractive, causing the U.S. go-private deals to fall apart. The other is that the revival of the bid to take Momo private is a sign of renewed interest among Chinese investors to push similar buyouts forward.\n\n\u201cDespite what may be perceived as headwinds in domestic markets, pending transactions are continuing to make progress,\u201d Ryan Roberts, a Hong Kong-based analyst at MCM Partners, said by e-mail. \u201cAs long as there is a valuation arbitrage to exploit between the U.S. and China markets, I expect the trade to remain attractive for the founders and owners who can force a deal through. \u201d\n\nThe buyouts have primarily targeted U.S.-traded Chinese companies because they\u2019re cheap compared with their mainland peers. A Bloomberg index of American depositary receipts of Chinese companies trades at a median forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16, compared with a multiple of 68 for shares on the Shenzhen Composite Index.\n\nInvestors boosted bets in the U.S. last week that the ADR deals will get done. Shares of the buyout targets last week sold on average for 7 percent less than the offering prices, down from 15 percent before the Alibaba news. That compares with an average discount of 2.6 percent in the 31 completed deals in the past three years. Momo and Renren Inc. trade at about a 20 percent discount to the offering prices, down from more than 50 percent and 30 percent the week before, the biggest spread in the group.\n\nJuicy Stocks\n\n\u201cIt shows the improving expectations for some of these juicy go-private names,\u201d said Henry Guo, a San Francisco-based analyst at Investment Technology Group, who thinks the valuations for Momo and Renren are at a reasonable level. \u201cThey are still considered as high quality companies compared to their counterparts in China. The main concerns are how long these deals will take and what investors will join the buyout. \u201d\n\nTime may be running out for the analysts who forecast a mass sprint to wrap up all the unfinished buyout business as investor groups take inspiration from Alibaba\u2019s lead. Takeover bids of Chinese ADRs have taken an average of 252 days to finish, according to data compiled by Bloomberg on completed deals since 2012. As for the 33 pending offers, they have already lingered 216 days since they were announced.\n\n\u201cI suspect that most of the proposed deals never happen or take so long to happen that they take place at much lower valuations,\u201d David Riedel, president of New York-based Riedel Research Group Inc., said by e-mail.\n\nPolicy Risks\n\nMomo and Youku may just be outliers because both companies are backed by Alibaba, indicating that \u201cthere is not a deep pool of potential investors into these deals,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth sides of the buyout debate agree that the combination of lengthy re-listing processes and increasing policy uncertainty in China may eclipse the outlook for the migration from an American exchange to a domestic one. Youku\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Victor Koo said on Wednesday that he is eyeing a local stock sale within three years, according to a China Daily report., a long time in a volatile market where regulation changes frequently.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nThe Chinese government has recently gone silent on a plan to introduce a strategic emerging industries board. The much-anticipated exchange that was scheduled for a rollout this year had been expected to carry lower listing requirements and offer a fresh fund-raising venue for technology companies. If that signals the government\u2019s intention to suspend the plans for a tech-friendly bourse, then it would create more uncertainty about how U.S.-listed Chinese companies find a way back to public markets at home.\n\n\u201cIn China, the market and policies just change too fast,\u201d Jun Zhang, who oversees China research at Rosenblatt Securities, said by phone from San Francisco. \u201cThere are always ways to go home if you want to.

Japan\u2019s most devastating earthquakes since March 2011 began striking the southern island of Kyushu on Thursday and have halted some engine and parts production for Aisin Seiki Co., chip manufacturing for Renesas Electronics Corp. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and motorcycle output for Honda Motor Co.\n\nToyota\u2019s loss of production may reach 56,000 vehicles for Toyota and Lexus and 7,500 units for minicar maker Daihatsu Motor Co., Koichi Sugimoto, a Tokyo-based analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley wrote in a report Monday.

Mitsubishi Motors sank by its daily limit to 583 yen at the close in Tokyo trading. The two-day decline wiped out about $2.5 billion of the company\u2019s market value.\n\nA bigger issue may still lie in store: Mitsubishi Motors has been testing passenger cars using a method not compliant with Japanese standards since 2002, according to Aikawa. While the company said it\u2019s unclear whether the flawed method enhanced or reduced fuel economy, further revelations that ratings have been exaggerated may overwhelm the automaker, which has the lowest level of cash among its Japanese peers. The carmaker required two rounds of bailouts more than a decade ago from Mitsubishi group companies to survive a scandal involving a cover-up of deadly defects.\n\n\u201cSince the cover-up of recalls in the 2000s, we have tried to reinforce compliance within the company, but a compliance sense still hasn\u2019t penetrated to every employee,\u201d Aikawa said Wednesday. \u201cI deeply understand how difficult it is to strengthen compliance, and I think this is a very shameful issue.\u201d\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said manipulating test data is an \u201cextremely serious\u201d issue. The government has inspected Mitsubishi Motors\u2019s plant and technical center in central Japan\u2019s Aichi prefecture since Wednesday and plans to disclose details of the misconduct as soon as possible, Suga told a briefing.\n\nMitsubishi Motors is focusing on cooperating with the investigations and isn\u2019t yet at a stage to think about bailout plans, Kai Inada, a spokesman of the company, said by phone.\n\nOf the affected minicars produced in the past three years, three quarters were supplied to Nissan Motor Co. In testing for their fuel efficiency, Mitsubishi Motors undervalued how much air and tire resistance the cars would encounter out on the road.\n\nThe deliberate use of biased data led to fuel efficiency being overstated for the Mitsubishi eK Wagon and eK Space, which are also sold by Nissan as the Dayz and Dayz Roox. The mishandling of the test data was intentional, Aikawa said.\n\nThe violation could result in Mitsubishi Motors having to pay back government tax rebates its minicars shouldn\u2019t have been eligible for, said Ryugo Nakao, an executive vice president.

The earnings impact is likely to be substantial as the company faces the possibility of compensating customers and Nissan, as well as lawsuits and government penalties, Sugimoto said.\n\nThe maker of Lancer cars and Outlander SUVs has been seeking to restore confidence in its vehicles after a series of scandals more than 10 years ago led the carmaker to seek multiple bailouts from Mitsubishi group companies.\n\nMitsubishi Motors\u2019s financial health relies heavily on companies in the Mitsubishi group. It received bailouts in 2004 and 2005 as revenue slumped following the company\u2019s admission it covered up defects for decades.\n\nThough independent, the companies are among the hundreds of Mitsubishi-named businesses that trace their roots to a shipping firm founded by Yataro Iwasaki in 1870, making them the oldest business collective in Japan. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corp., the two main companies of the Mitsubishi group, own a combined 22.7 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nRebuilding Reputation\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time for Mitsubishi to have this kind of issues and this definitely won\u2019t help them rebuild their reputation,\u201d said Seiji Sugiura, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.\n\nMitsubishi Motors reported having 484.7 billion yen in cash and equivalents as of the end of December, the least among Japan\u2019s major automakers and about one-tenth the cash pile on Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s balance sheet. Mitsubishi Motors has a market value of about $5.2 billion.\n\nThe company\u2019s meager financial resources leave it stretched thin for research and development. Mitsubishi Motors forecast spending 82 billion yen for the fiscal year ended in March. By contrast, Toyota would have had to spend about 88 billion yen on average per month to meet its annual projection.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the falsification of data will compromise Mitsubishi Motors\u2019s minicar alliance with Nissan, which discovered the discrepancy. Nissan voluntarily suspended sales of the Dayz and Dayz Roox models Wednesday until Mitsubishi Motors provided further clarification, said Jonathan Adashek, a Nissan spokesman.\n\nVW Scandal\n\nThe most important business stories of the day.

Kensho provides data analytics to banks.\n\n\u201cYou have probably the most expensive utility infielders in the world here,\u201d earning six figures for work of little real value, Nadler said. \u201cThose people are not going to have jobs. It\u2019s only shocking to the people who hold those jobs right now.\u201d\n\nJob Cuts\n\nBanks have cut tens of thousands of jobs since the 2008 financial crisis as global regulatory changes have shattered the old banking models. That trend will continue as the complexity and interconnections of financial markets increasingly mean computer algorithms and artificial intelligence take over the roles of human decision-makers.\n\nDavid Siegel, co-chairman of Two Sigma Investments LP, which has $35 billion under management, said the day may come when banks aren\u2019t even needed to hold money if digital currencies like bitcoin flourish. With blockchain, the distributed software protocol that enables bitcoin to work, authorities like central banks and governments may also see their roles vastly diminished, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable power structure shift,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt will ultimately be very hard for governments to stop this advancement because this technology will be so widely available,\u201d making it hard to police, Siegel said. \u201cProbably the same thing will happen with virtual currencies. How do you stop it? It\u2019s software.\u201d\n\nBanks have moved vast resources and money into their regulatory and compliance departments in the past several years, Adena Friedman, chief operating officer of Nasdaq Inc., said on the panel. Only now can financial firms start concentrating on new business opportunities to increase efficiency. \u201cThat\u2019s been a really big shift,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are about embracing the technology today, whether it\u2019s Kensho or blockchain.\u201d\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nNadler said the job losses and repositioning of Wall Street ultimately will help refurbish bankers\u2019 image with young people. He talked about the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders and its resonance with millenials, who are livid over the \u201crent\u201d that finance extracts from the economy without providing corresponding benefits. That rent-taking is done by \u201creally mediocre people feeling entitled\u201d at the world\u2019s largest banks, Nadler said.\n\nWall Street Love?\n\nThat assessment received a quick gut check from Siegel. \u201cPeople will love Wall Street because we move our technology to the cloud?\u201d he said, laughing.\n\nYet not all is lost, according to Corrie Elston, Google Inc.\u2019s chief technology officer for Google Cloud Platform.\n\n\u201cThe reason everyone in this room should be super happy about machine intelligence is because it\u2019s about data,\u201d he said. The sheer amount and complexity of data related to financial markets has overcome human computational powers, so bringing in machines to process it all is almost the only alternative, and can lead to new opportunities, he said.\n\n\u201cBoom! There\u2019s a different way to do business,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was less sanguine on recent blockchain developments. The blockchain that supports bitcoin is open to the public because it employs powerful encryption methods. Yet financial firms haven\u2019t wanted to create blockchains where they don\u2019t know all the participants, so they\u2019ve opted to explore so-called private blockchains.\n\n\u201cPrivate blockchains will disappear over time\u201d because they amount to nothing more than a database, Elston said. A situation like Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.\u2019s 2008 bankruptcy wouldn\u2019t have been avoided if it had been on a private blockchain, and in fact it would have made things worse, he said.\n\nNasdaq\u2019s Friedman disagreed.

The market almost immediately started paring bets the Bank of Canada will be forced to do any more of its own stimulus, after two interest-rate cuts earlier this year.\n\nThe policy turn makes Canada unique among its developed peers. Since joining together in massive government spending packages to spur the world out of recession in 2009, many nations have focused on balancing budgets and left most of the work of stimulating growth to ever more extreme central-bank monetary policy, from bond-buying programs to zero interest rates.\n\n\u201cCanada\u2019s departing from most of the crowd,\" Darrell Duffie, a Canadian economist at California\u2019s Stanford University, said Tuesday in a telephone interview. \u201cNo other major leaders globally that I know of have been willing to take this step.\"\n\nAt its meeting Wednesday, the central bank opted to leave its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.5 percent while lowering its economic growth forecasts. Chances for a rate cut next year are falling too.\n\n\u2018Balancing Act\u2019\n\nOdds the central bank will reduce the overnight rate by April dropped to about 14 percent after the election, from 22 percent before, and probability of a cut in July crept down to 15 percent from 21 percent, Bloomberg calculations on overnight index swaps data show.\n\n\"People are relying too much on monetary stimulus,\" Stanford\u2019s Duffie said. \"It\u2019s a balancing act, and there has been a tendency for fiscal authorities to be very conservative with various flavors of austerity, and monetary authorities are left holding the bag.\"\n\nJustin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals swept to power Monday, capturing a surprise majority by winning 184 of 338 seats in the lower house of Parliament and putting an end to the near decade-long reign of Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservatives, who consistently argued against using budget deficits to stimulate growth in times of economic expansion.\n\nDelivering Stimulus\n\nThe Liberals, on the other hand, pledged to deliver stimulus by running deficits of C$25.1 billion ($19.3 billion) over three years, and to increase infrastructure spending by C$60 billion over a decade to C$125 billion.\n\nThe Liberals\u2019 \u201cpro-growth plan,\u201d along with their \u201cRobin Hood-style\u201d tax proposals, will take pressure off the Bank of Canada to pursue further policy accommodation, David Rosenberg, chief economist in Toronto at Gluskin Sheff & Associates, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.\n\nThe Canadian dollar, which had touched an 11-year low this year on speculation another rate cut was on the way, rose the day after the election. The yield on the government\u2019s benchmark 10-year bond, which touched a record low of its own in August, climbed to its highest in almost a month.\n\nNational Bank Financial predicts the size of the Liberal budget deficit will lift 10-year bond yields by as much as 15 basis points more. National Bank economists led by Stefane Marion said the increase in infrastructure spending will \u201clift the economy\u2019s potential growth which had been hindered for years by underinvestment.\u201d\n\n\u2018Direct Spending\u2019\n\nThe most important market news of the day.

On the monetary side you can\u2019t force people to spend money by lowering rates. It has some impact but rates are already close to zero in most parts of the world, so there\u2019s only so much impact monetary policy can have at this point.\"\n\nThe Bank of Canada\u2019s current benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent is already just one typical rate move -- a quarter of a percentage point -- away from the all-time low reached during the Great Recession.\n\nIn Europe and Japan, meanwhile, where benchmark rates have already been cut to record lows and central banks have embarked on extraordinary monetary stimulus to drive them down more, speculation remains policy makers will have to add to those programs with economic growth still uncertain.\n\nPurse Strings\n\nFinancial luminaries such as Bill Gross, who once ran the world\u2019s largest bond fund, have said central banks can\u2019t rescue economies on their own and governments have to open their purse strings. Policy makers are starting to echo the call.\n\nOne of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s top economic advisers recently said the government needs to consider fiscal stimulus. A U.S. Treasury Department report released the day of Canada\u2019s election advised euro-area governments that central-bank policy alone may not be enough to spur growth, saying governments should pitch in with spending too.\n\nEven in the U.S., where better economic data have the Federal Reserve contemplating raising interest rates, former central bank chairman Ben Bernanke said earlier this month lawmakers need to step up with economic stimulus of their own to sustain growth.\n\nThe prospect of fiscal stimulus offers \u201cone more reason for the Bank of Canada to say monetary policy has done enough,\u201d BMO\u2019s Reitzes said by telephone from Toronto.", "date": "2015-10-21 00:00:00", "title": "Canadians Buck Global Austerity, Giving Central Bank a Breather"}

It\u2019s approved for people with a genetic disease causing ultra-high levels of bad cholesterol, and for those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease such as heart attacks or strokes, the Food and Drug Administration said in a statement Friday.\n\nSanofi and Regeneron had sought to sell the drug to people whose ultra-high cholesterol levels aren\u2019t inherited. Along with Amgen Inc. -- whose competing drug could be approved next month -- they\u2019re studying whether the medicine can prevent heart attacks, stroke and death, which could help eventually expand their use.\n\nWhen Amgen\u2019s drug comes to market, pharmacy benefit managers may pit the companies against one another, much like they recently did with hepatitis C treatments. How successful they\u2019ll be depends on how similar the cholesterol drugs are.\n\n\u201cOur greatest preference, to be very clear, is to be where we are now in hepatitis, to have multiple drugs out there at affordable prices,\u201d Express Scripts Holding Co. Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in a telephone interview.\n\nThe makers of the cholesterol drugs have taken a different approach than Gilead Sciences Inc., which didn\u2019t discuss pricing before its hepatitis C drugs hit the market.\n\n\u201cThe companies have had discussions with us about what is sustainable and what isn\u2019t,\u201d Miller said. Express Scripts is the biggest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, and has been at the forefront of the pricing discussions.\n\nFail First\n\nAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the lobby group for insurers, criticized Praluent\u2019s cost. \u201cThe exorbitant price raises concerns as to whether consumers and the health system can sustain the long-term cost,\u201d said Dan Durham, the group\u2019s interim chief executive officer.\n\nCVS Health Corp. is the second-biggest pharmacy manager, and Chief Medical Officer Troy Brennan said the pharmacy benefit manager would ensure patients have tried other drug first.

The European Union approved it Tuesday with a broader label that includes all patients with high cholesterol who aren\u2019t able to get it under control with statins, and those who can\u2019t tolerate statins.\n\nPraluent and Repatha are part of a category of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors, designed to help patients who can\u2019t get very high levels of bad cholesterol under control. According to the FDA, Praluent is supposed to be used along with \u201cmaximally tolerated statin therapy\u201d and a better diet.

Musk has publicly taken responsibility for what he described as engineering \"hubris\" that packed too many new features into the first version of the SUV, including the double-hinged \"falcon-wing\" doors and mono-post seats. The Model X was delayed by more than 18 months, following missed launch dates for previous models.

Long-term debt rose to $3.12 billion from $2.65 billion at year-end. The company drew from its line of credit and paid most of it back. Most of the cash generated via orders placed for the Model 3 came in after the quarter had closed -- and really isn\u2019t ideal for capital investments, Musk said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we want to rely too much on customer reservation money as a source of capital,\u201d he said during the first-quarter earnings call with analysts. \u201cMaybe there is a buffer or something, but it\u2019s not as a primary source of capital. I think it\u2019s going to make sense for us to raise some amount of money -- some combination of equity and debt -- and make sure the company has a good buffer of cash on hand.

And we would like to take a bigger share.\u201d\n\nNippon Ceramic rose 2.2 percent in Tokyo trading, as the benchmark Topix index fell 0.6 percent.\n\nDoubling Profit\n\nThe chipmaker plans to invest as much as 1 billion yen ($9.2 million) to expand manufacturing capacity in the Philippines, he said. Nippon Ceramic, which controls about 50 percent of the global market for ultrasonic sensors, is expected to almost double its net income by 2018, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nNippon Ceramic also is in talks with a European autonomous-driving system supplier seeking to switch from in-house production to purchasing the sensors from outside. This may further boost Nippon Ceramic\u2019s market share, said Taniguchi, who declined to disclose the supplier\u2019s name.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that a quarter of all cars sold by 2035 will be able to guide themselves.

Rather, it supplies the ultrasonic sensors to companies including Denso Corp. and Panasonic Corp., which then package them into electronics systems for Toyota, Ford, General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nUltrasonic sensor Source: Nippon Ceramic Co.\n\nToyota, the largest automaker, committed $1 billion over the next five years on research including autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and robotics.

Sales of the ultrasonic sensors for vehicles will grow even faster, at about 10 percent annually, Taniguchi said. Shares of the company, which also makes sensors for security systems and car air conditioners, rose 46 percent in the three years ending Dec. 31.\n\nUltrasonic sensors installed near the front and rear bumpers -- one under each headlight and two under each tail light -- detect objects and obstacles within a 5-meter (16-foot) range. They function along with radar and cameras, which spot obstacles in longer range, to help vehicles avoid collisions.\n\nTV Remotes\n\nAt slower speeds, such as in a traffic jam or in a parking lot, they measure the distance to other objects and send a signal for the brakes to engage.\n\nNippon Ceramic is small -- its market capitalization of $454 million is less than the value of vehicles sold by Toyota in a day -- yet it has a history of being in the forefront of new technology.\n\nIt was founded by Yoshiharu Taniguchi in 1975 in Tottori, a coastal prefecture about 500 kilometers (310 miles) west of Tokyo known for its pears. Right after the company started business, its ultrasonic sensors were embedded in TV remote controls sold under the Sanyo brand.\n\nThose became such a hit because of their accuracy that Nippon Ceramic was flooded with orders from other TV makers, yet it didn\u2019t add manufacturing capacity because management considered the demand a short-lived fad.\n\n\u201cUnlike back then, we believe the demand for ultrasonic sensors for autonomous driving cars is real this time around,\u201d Taniguchi said.", "date": "2016-04-10 00:00:00", "title": "92-Cent Crash Avoidance Sensor Drives Nippon Ceramic's Gains"}

Luring customers with photos of tasty curries along with discounts and free delivery, they sought to disrupt the delivery networks that have existed in India since the 1890s, including Mumbai\u2019s famously low-tech dabbawalas, who ferry 175,000 meals\u2014some from cooks\u2019 homes, others from central kitchens\u2014to office workers and students daily. The time-tested deliverymen carry boxes via trains, bicycles, and pushcarts to their hungry clients, using a system of alphanumeric codes printed on reusable containers.\n\nThe new services offered something dabbawalas don\u2019t: last-minute ordering and the ability to choose dishes from hundreds of restaurants. Dabbawalas require a monthly commitment, and customers are locked into a meal plan for the entire period. Even so, most of the high-tech startups have foundered, and dozens have closed. The ones that are surviving, including TinyOwl and Foodpanda Hellofood\u2019s India unit, are shrunken versions of their former selves. \u201cThe story was glorious when they had lots of money in the bank, but they went madly after customer growth and spent it quickly,\u201d says Anil Joshi, an investor and founder of Unicorn India Ventures in Mumbai, who didn\u2019t invest in food delivery companies.\n\nMeanwhile, the dabbawalas appear to be busier than ever. While they have no apps, they\u2019ve managed to retain market share. And they\u2019re jumping on the e-commerce bandwagon themselves\u2014by lending delivery staff to companies such as giant e-tailer Flipkart and offering training programs for new tech-enabled merchandise delivery startups such as Roadrunnr.\n\n175k\n\nNumber of meals delivered to office workers daily\n\n\u201cAll these people got into the business and offered services for very cheap, but they forgot that they needed to make money to survive,\u201d says Subodh Sangle, a coordinator with the Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Association, a union representing about 5,000 lunchbox deliverymen. \u201cWe have been working in this field for so many years and know what it takes to deliver meals at the right price.\u201d\n\nThe experience of TinyOwl is telling. The Mumbai-based platform to order food from nearby restaurants started in 2014 and raised about $20 million in its first year. Its workforce grew to about 1,200 in early 2015, and co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Harshvardhan Mandad said he planned to expand operations to 50 cities by the end of that year. By November the company had let go of 270 workers, mostly call-center employees and delivery personnel. When one of the co-founders arrived to break the news at the company\u2019s office in Pune, a city near Mumbai, he was taken hostage by angry employees who demanded immediate payment of severance packages, technology news site MediaNama reported. Police were called in to rescue the executive, the report said. He didn\u2019t respond to calls and text messages seeking comment. The company now operates in just two cities, with about 200 employees.\n\nTinyOwl\u2019s biggest rival was Foodpanda, a restaurant delivery provider owned by Germany\u2019s Rocket Internet. With operations in more than 25 nations, it entered New Delhi in 2012 and rapidly expanded to more than 30 cities across India, with a workforce swelling to 1,300 by late last year. While the company spent heavily on TV ads and discounts to woo consumers, its operations were plagued with poor technology, accounts of swindling by fake restaurants, and theft by employees and contractors, the Mint newspaper reported in September.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\n\u201cThe challenges on the ground are far bigger than anyone can imagine,\u201d Foodpanda India CEO Saurabh Kochhar said in an e-mail. \u201cWe face issues from mindset to infrastructure to capabilities.\u201d He said the company dismissed 15 percent of its workforce as part of its move to automate operations. Local media reports said layoffs were more than double that percentage. Kochhar declined to comment on the company\u2019s investigation into the fraud allegations.\n\nLabeled lunch containers.

But not in India.\u201d Still, the India business is \u201cbetter than ever,\u201d he says, denying local media reports the unit is for sale.\n\nPart of the problem is that the companies expanded too quickly, hiring scores of delivery personnel and call-center employees. That\u2019s led to a \u201cquasi-crisis kind of situation\u201d as salaries for delivery staff have risen almost 70 percent in the past year, says Rituparna Chakraborty, senior vice president at recruitment consultant TeamLease. Upstarts including Swiggy have skipped hiring delivery staff altogether, instead recruiting part-timers for each delivery.\n\nEven seasoned players have struggled to make food ordering work. Seven-year-old, Sequoia Capital-funded Zomato Media is India\u2019s biggest aggregator of restaurant menus. It got into food delivery last May, along with a new cashless payment service. But in November it fired about 300 people, 10 percent of its staff, and ditched the cashless service.\n\nTiny Owl operations in Mumbai. Photographer: Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg\n\nThe company said in a blog post that it had overspent on the program, including handing out free iPads to thousands of restaurants. In December it said it was shutting down online ordering in 4 of 14 cities where it operates. \u201cDespite Zomato\u2019s recent marketing efforts, including television ads, it didn\u2019t see a significant increase in the order volumes in these few cities,\u201d co-founder Pankaj Chaddah said in a statement.\n\nFor restaurateurs such as Rajiv Rambhia, who runs the Local Bites restaurant in Mumbai, the flush of food-ordering apps has been a mixed experience. There was the initial boom when TinyOwl, Foodpanda, and others lured lots of customers by offering discounts of as much as 50 percent. Then the discounts started drying up, and the app companies started charging restaurants commissions of as much as a fifth of each order. \u201cObviously, if you offer them a 50 percent discount, people will come,\u201d Rambhia says. \u201cWhen the offer stops, those orders also stop. My business hasn\u2019t really gone up because of these guys.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line: Food delivery apps in India raised $120 million from investors in the past three years but failed to displace traditional meal deliverymen.", "date": "2016-02-03 00:00:00", "title": "Startups Haven\u2019t Replaced India\u2019s 19th Century Food Delivery Service"}

If that signals a suspension of plans for a tech-friendly bourse, it would cast yet more uncertainty over investors\u2019 exit strategies for Internet companies, many of which are de-listing from U.S. exchanges to seek higher valuations back home.\n\nThe envisioned board in Shanghai had been expected to carry lower listing requirements and offer a fresh fund-raising venue for emerging companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s financial affiliate and Baidu Inc.\u2019s video service.

But if you want one soon\u2014and particularly if you want to have any hope of taking full advantage of government subsidies\u2014you should probably get in line now.\n\nThis isn't a figure of speech. Eager Model 3 buyers can go join the queue at the nearest Tesla showroom, where starting Thursday morning you can put down a $1,000 deposit in person. Nevermind that no one has even seen the car yet and that the first delivery won't happen for at least another year.\n\nTesla enthusiasts in Santa Monica, California, wait overnight to join the queue for the Model 3. Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg\n\nIt sounds ludicrous, but that's exactly what thousands of people around the world are going to do: Put down a $1,000 without so much as a test drive or a single review. Some analysts are anticipating more than 100,000 reservations in the next few weeks. People started camping out, iPhone-style, at several showrooms in California on Wednesday, and a man in Australia reportedly stood in line for 48 hours to be first to put down a deposit. This isn't to drive away with a shiny new Tesla; this is for a reservation to buy one many months in the future.\n\n\n\nThere's a rational case for the frenzy. Early buyers might save as much as $7,500 off the $35,000 sticker price of the Model 3. The rush is on, in part, because a crucial U.S. federal tax credit set up to encourage development of electric cars is nearing its expiration. The tax credit's complicated phase-out begins for each carmaker several months after achieving a cumulative 200,000 in U.S. sales of electric cars. For Tesla, that threshold isn't far off.\n\nThe chart below estimates the value of the declining subsidy over time. Using a simple sales growth rate of 50 percent for the projections, Tesla crosses the 200,000 mark around June 2018, and the subsidy begins to decline in October 2018. Chevy's EV sales, which have slumped the past few years after the company took an early lead, may speed up again with the anticipated release of the company's long-range electric Bolt later this year, but that shouldn't dramatically alter the timeline.\n\nWhether anyone will actually get the Model 3 for $25,000 will depend on Tesla getting it to market on time\u2014and running on schedule isn't Tesla's strong suit. The company is notorious for yearslong delays of new products, from its original Roadster to the recent Model X. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, a longtime proponent of buying Tesla shares, doesn't believe Tesla's Model 3 will hit the streets until late 2018, a year after Musk has promised it would appear.\n\nReservations Start at the Showrooms, Then It Gets Tricky\n\nTravel with us, drive with us, eat with us. Get our weekly Pursuits newsletter.\n\nTesla will begin taking reservations for the Model 3 when showrooms around the world open at 10 a.m. Thursday, regardless of time zone. But the Australians who are the first to sign up might be some of the last to receive their cars. Instead, the rollout will start for priority groups in California and move east from there, eventually reaching buyers in Europe and Asia. People who drive on the left side of the road are last in line.\n\nTo make matters worse for cash-strapped Tesla enthusiasts, the first cars off the production line won't be the sticker-price base model. The first to receive deliveries will include current owners of a Model S or Model X, Tesla employees, and buyers who select higher-priced options.\n\nIt's a complicated reservation system. Tesla says a reservation confers \"approximate priority within your region.\" Morgan Stanley's Jonas anticipates an initial average price of delivered cars to be $60,000 before tax incentives.\n\n\n\nIn other words, if you want a $35,000 Model 3 any time soon, and especially if you want to qualify for U.S. incentives, you want to be as high on that list as possible. The $1,000 deposit is refundable at any time until Tesla is ready to build your car. Then they'll ask you to configure your car and sign a purchase agreement, or lose your (approximate) place in line.\n\nThe Schedule for the Introduction of the Model 3\n\n10 a.m. all time zones: Showrooms open and begin taking in-person reservations with a $1,000 refundable deposit.\n\nShowrooms open and begin taking in-person reservations with a $1,000 refundable deposit. 8:30 p.m. California time: The Model 3 event begins, streaming live from Hawthorne, Calif., on Tesla's website.\n\nThe Model 3 event begins, streaming live from Hawthorne, Calif., on Tesla's website. 8:30 p.m. California time: Simultaneously, the company begins accepting $1,000 reservations online.\n\nSimultaneously, the company begins accepting $1,000 reservations online. 2017: Tesla begins contacting reservation holders to ask them to customize their car and lock in their purchase.\n\nTesla begins contacting reservation holders to ask them to customize their car and lock in their purchase.

Alibaba-backed Meituan.com and Tencent-backed Dianping.com, which have been competing in offering local services online, said Thursday they would merge. Under their agreement, Wang Xing, chief executive officer of Meituan, and his counterpart at Dianping, Zhang Tao, will run the new company as co-chairmen and co-CEOs.\n\nThe deal will create a clear leader in a crowded field, just like the two men did earlier this year when they combined Didi and Kuaidi to establish a dominant player in ride-hailing services that could fend off Uber Technologies Inc. Joining forces may allow the longtime rivals to divide China\u2019s most promising Internet businesses between them, boosting their own profits while freezing out the competition.\n\n\"Business makes strange bed fellows,\" said Andy Mok, the organizer of Beijing Tech Hive, a series of events linking investors and startups. \"They\u2019re both obviously very smart, driven business people, but at the end of the day practicality trumps personality.\"\n\nSmartphone Shopping\n\nMeituan.com is a group-buying site similar to Groupon Inc., where people can get discounts on goods and services by making purchases together. It held about 52 percent of the 77 billion yuan ($12.1 billion) market in the first half of the year, according to a report by researcher Analysys International. Dianping.com, which also runs a consumer review site like Yelp Inc., accounted for about 30 percent.\n\nThey\u2019re examples of how China\u2019s largest Internet companies are investing heavily in the $1.6 trillion online-to-offline services market, betting consumers will increasingly use smartphones and tablets to book everything from hotel rooms to car rides to grocery deliveries.\n\nAlibaba shares rose 3.7 percent in U.S. trading to $66.28 at the close in New York, leaving them down 36 percent this year.\n\nBaidu Threat?\n\nTheir alliance poses a threat to Baidu Inc. Chairman Robin Li, the third giant of China\u2019s Internet who has also targeted what\u2019s known as the O2O market. Baidu, the leading search-engine in China, is investing $3.2 billion over three years in its own provider of local services. Baidu\u2019s Nuomi is the third-largest player in group buying with 13.6 percent of the market, according to Analysys.\n\n\"The market is still at an early, fast-growth stage, which means it\u2019s too early in the game to decide who the ultimate winner\u2019s going to be,\" said Kaiser Kuo, a spokesman for Baidu. \"Local is still Baidu\u2019s turf to win, and we are very, very committed.\"\n\nThe deal comes as venture financing is becoming more difficult to obtain in China amid the slowing economy and wobbly stock market. Many Web startups that had been burning cash through big incentives to draw customers are facing pressure to cut their losses.\n\n\"Winter is coming for the capital market,\" said Jeff Hao, a Hong Kong-based analyst at China Merchants Securities Holdings. \"It\u2019s getting harder to find people who are willing to invest.\"\n\nRival Billionaires\n\nJack Ma, 51, and Ma \"Pony\" Huateng, 43, have been rivals almost since the Internet began to take off in China. Jack started Alibaba from his Hangzhou apartment in 1999 with $60,000 and built it into the leading e-commerce player in the country. Pony created the instant messaging service QQ for Tencent in Shenzhen in 1999 and now has user base of more than 1 billion for his messaging, games and other services.\n\nThe two companies have traded positions as the most valuable Internet company in China, with Tencent currently ahead. Jack has a higher personal net worth at $26.7 billion, compared with Pony\u2019s $17.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world.

In the current deal, Meituan\u2019s shareholders will own about 60 percent of the combined company, which will be valued at about $15 billion, the people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private.\n\nAn Alibaba-Tencent tie-up in local services would mirror the creation of Didi Kuaidi this year via a merger of competing taxi-hailing apps they separately backed.

And they have continued to fall in 2016.\n\nInvestor Markdowns\n\nOne big factor in the recent price decline has been the markdowns mutual fund managers like Fidelity Investments have taken on their startup stakes, according to Andy Nick, a managing director at Greenhill Cogent.\n\nSince the beginning of the year Fidelity has marked down the value of its holdings in Canadian startup Hootsuite Media Inc., Dropbox Inc., web performance and cybersecurity company CloudFlare Inc., electronic signature technology maker DocuSign Inc. and data center hardware and software makers Nutanix Inc.\n\nFunds with big exposures to unicorns -- private companies valued at more than $1 billion -- could trade at 60 percent of their NAV, according to Nick.\n\n\u201cInvestors are getting skeptical that marks are not reflective of true value. They are worried that they might not get their marked value when they get liquidity,\u201d he said.\n\nPrivate funding rounds at flat or lower valuations and write-downs like those at Fidelity have had a \u201ccascading\u201d effect on secondary pricing, according to Sunaina Sinha, founder and managing partner at placement agent and secondary adviser Cebile Capital.\n\nInvestors now prefer funds with a diversified portfolio, rather than hefty exposure to a single unicorn, Sinha said.\n\nHealth-care Down\n\nHealth-care and life sciences funds have been particularly affected, with the average price falling from 84 percent in June 2015 to 69 percent in December, weighed down by the volatility in listed health-care share prices, according to Greenhill Cogent.\n\n\u201cPricing through the beginning of the third quarter of 2015 stayed largely in line with pricing in 2014 in the low 80s,\u201d Greenhill Cogent\u2019s Nick said. \u201cHowever, the public market volatility toward the end of the year and increased doubts regarding exits for unicorns -- Square\u2019s initial public offering, news regarding Theranos, Good Technology -- weighed on buyers\u2019 perceptions.\u201d\n\nDuring the final quarter of 2015, about 18 percent of startups raised money at the same or lower valuations than in their previous funding rounds, according to a report from Silicon Valley law firm Fenwick & West LLP.\n\nDuring 2015, 29 percent of 41 U.S.-based technology companies that went public did so at a lower valuation than their final private funding round, according to the report.\n\nUnicorns could comprise 90 percent of some funds\u2019 values, according to Peter McGrath, a managing director at Toronto-based secondaries firm Setter Capital. As pre-IPO finance rounds have flattened or declined for some companies, venture capital funds\u2019 limited partners have become more conservative, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, sentiment toward later stage venture and growth funds has improved, as investors in later rounds tend to have better protection if the company was exited below the value of the funding round, according to Nick.\n\n\u201cPeople are gravitating towards late-stage venture capital. They think those are a bit more \u2018real,\u2019 with less risk,\u201d Nick said. \u201cThe caveat is that if there is a unicorn in the portfolio, all bets are off.\u201d\n\nSome older funds with \u201ctired\u201d assets can attract a 30 percent discount to NAV, according to Mathieu Drean of Triago.

The timing of new technologies is difficult to predict, but it may not be long before it becomes impossible to ignore.\n\nRead the deep dive: Here's How Electric Cars Will Cause the Next Oil Crisis", "date": "2016-02-24 00:00:00", "title": "Another Oil Crash Is Coming, and There May Be No Recovery"}

Yet somehow he's always running behind schedule. Some would call this a failure of management, but it might just be a business strategy. Call it the Musk Doctrine.\n\nIt goes something like this: People do paradigm-shifting work only when they\u2019re under tremendous pressure, so the key is to ensure deadlines are always impossible. This could help explain why Musk has never launched a product on time, yet no one seems able to keep up with him. It drives Wall Street nuts.\n\nMusk, 44, tipped his hand on this winning-through-failure strategy last week when he set the launch date for Tesla's widely anticipated Model 3 electric car astonishingly early: July 1, 2017. But not really, Musk explained.\n\n\"Now, will we actually be able to achieve volume production on July 1 next year? Of course not,\" he said on Tesla's earnings call. \"In order for us to be confident of achieving volume production of Model 3 by late 2017, we actually have to set a date of mid-2017 and really hold people's feet to the fire, internally and externally.\"\n\nCalling His Own Bluffs\n\nWhat makes Musk's deadline bluffs unusual is that he makes them public and lets investors hold him to account. Take what happened when he dropped his biggest bombshell last week, unveiling what is arguably the most ambitious production timeline in the history of cars. Musk said he plans to go from making about 50,000 electric cars a year to 500,000\u2014by 2018.\n\nThat's two years ahead of his previous target, which itself was dismissed by Wall Street as nearly impossible. And 2018? That's \"too aggressive, setting up investors for disappointment,\" wrote UBS AG analyst Colin Langan in a note to investors.\n\nSome may even view Musk's strategy as having less to do with motivation and more to do with financing. Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan Chase & Co. said the new target may be seen as a \u201cperfect rationale for a large equity capital raise.\"\n\nBut Tesla doesn't necessarily need a new justification for raising capital. Wall Street was already anticipating such a move after the company took in 400,000 (refundable) deposits, at $1,000 apiece, for the Model 3\u2014showing a level of demand that was as unexpected as it was unprecedented. If anything, the head-scratching 2018 goal is making investors more nervous about the cash burn, not less.\n\n\"We are all for setting aggressive targets,\" wrote Joseph Spak, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \"However, Tesla is increasingly asking the equity investor to sign up for a complex manufacturing ramp the likes of which we don't believe [has] ever been seen before. This brings both elevated expectations and execution risk.\"\n\nIn the more typical expectations game played by publicly traded companies, the 2018 goal just doesn't make sense. Normally, companies prefer to overperform. Instead, Musk is making the future come early again\u2014only this time, it's Tesla's day of reckoning he's moved up.\n\nThe only way to make real sense of the new deadline is to apply the Musk Doctrine. Consider that he might have been running dangerously close of meeting one of his impossible deadlines. If the 2020 goal looked as if it could actually be met, that meant everyone could be working harder, and thus expectations should be moved forward. So that's what Musk did. He now projects 1 million annual electric car sales by 2020. Try meeting that goal.\n\nRisky Gambit\n\nThe gambit comes with risks. While it ensures a sense of mission among Tesla employees, it runs the risk of burning them out just when the company can afford it least. Two of Tesla's top manufacturing executives are leaving before the big Model 3 push, Bloomberg reported last week. When describing the accelerated timeline for tooling the Model 3, Musk quipped, \"If you can create a human baby in nine months, you can pretty much make a tool in nine months.\" Gestation never seemed so easy.\n\nThe markets weren't so sanguine. Usually when a company significantly increases its forecast, the stock price goes up. Not this time. After Tesla announced its new target, shares dipped. Analysts cited a new risk of failure in the 2018 deadline, including the extra capital it would require to even attempt it.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nThe new forecast, like the original 2020 deadline, seems a farce. But something funny happened on Thursday, the day after Musk moved the goalposts. Even as Tesla's stock declined, analysts and auto enthusiasts almost universally moved their own estimates for Tesla unit sales higher. In the same report in which RBC's Spak warned of \"the risk to new investment\" and maintained a neutral rating on the stock, he nearly doubled his forecast for Tesla's 2020 sales, to 620,000. That's higher than Musk's old target\u2014the one most considered impossible.\n\nThis may be the doctrine at work. Even though Tesla's founder is almost certain to fail at his new goals\u2014and is putting the faith of his investors and car buyers at risk in the process\u2014he also just changed everyone's horizon of expectations. What was once considered an impossibility for Tesla, and for electric cars in general, is now considered the most likely course of events.", "date": "2016-05-09 00:00:00", "title": "Elon Musk's Tesla Strategy: Win Big by Falling Short"}

They weren\u2019t there to just talk about blockchain, the new technology some predict will transform finance, but to build and experiment with the software.\n\nBy the end of the day, they had seen something revolutionary: U.S. dollars transformed into pure digital assets, able to be used to execute and settle a trade instantly. That\u2019s the promise of a blockchain, where the cumbersome and error-prone system that takes days to move money across town or around the world is replaced with almost instant certainty. The event was created by Chain, one of many startups trying to rewire the financial industry, with representatives from Nasdaq, Citigroup Inc., Visa Inc., Fidelity, Fiserv Inc., Pfizer Inc. and others in the room.\n\nThe event -- announced in a statement this Monday -- marked a key moment in the evolution of blockchain, notable both for what was achieved, as well as how many firms were involved. The technology\u2019s potential has captivated Wall Street executives because it offers a way to free up billions of dollars by speeding transactions that currently can take days, tying up capital. But a huge piece of that puzzle is transforming cash into a digital form. And while some firms have conducted experiments, the Chain event showed a large number of them are now looking jointly at a potential solution.\n\n\u201cWe created a digital dollar\u201d to show the group at Nasdaq an instant debit and credit on a blockchain, said Marc West, chief technology officer at Fiserv, a transaction and payments company with more than 13,000 clients across the financial industry. \u201cThis is the first time the money has moved.\u201d\n\nQuietly Building\n\nChain is already known in some Wall Street circles for its project to help Nasdaq shift trading of non-public company shares onto a blockchain. But for the most part, it has kept relatively quiet compared with other fintech ventures.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company also used the April 11 meeting to introduce its customers and investors to Chain Open Standard, an open-source blockchain platform that the venture has been designing for more than a year, said Adam Ludwin, the company\u2019s chief executive officer. What Chain has done is engineer the complicated elements needed for a blockchain to work, so that its customers can build custom solutions on top of that to solve business problems, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been quietly building with a whole bunch of folks for a few years,\u201d he said. \u201cBlockchains are networks, so we think collaboration is important, but what\u2019s even more important than collaboration at the beginning is getting the model right.\u201d The event was kept secret so executives could freely share nascent ideas and take risks. \u201cThe more press, the less quality of the dialogue and problem-solving,\u201d he said.\n\nThe most common blockchain is the one supporting the digital currency bitcoin, which has been active since 2009. Financial firms have been reluctant to embrace bitcoin, however, as its anonymous users could entangle banks in violations of anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer regulations. Digital U.S. dollars, or any other fiat currency, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t pose those risks.\n\n\u2018Mainframe Era\u2019\n\nNasdaq and Citigroup partnered to explore how they can work together, said Brad Peterson, the exchange-owner\u2019s chief information officer. He said blockchain also could be used for reference data -- how specific stocks or bonds are identified across all markets, for example.\n\nWall Street was one of the earliest beneficiaries of computers replacing office systems. Now 30 years later, those legacy systems can be a hindrance to further technological evolution, he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the great opportunity -- how to unlock that ability to work your way out from under the mainframe era,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile cash in a bank account moves electronically all the time today, there\u2019s a distinction between that system and what it means to say money is digital. Electronic payments are really just messages that cash needs to move from one account to another, and this reconciliation is what adds time to the payments process. For customers, moving money between accounts can take days as banks wait for confirmations. Digital dollars, however, are pre-loaded into a system like a blockchain. From there, they can be swapped immediately for an asset.\n\n\u201cInstead of a record or message being moved, it\u2019s the actual asset,\u201d Ludwin said. \u201cThe payment and the settlement become the same thing.\u201d\n\nRare Collaboration\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nIan Lee, head of Citigroup\u2019s global lab network and acceleration fund, said one of the first areas of research Citigroup undertook when it began studying blockchain was how digital cash could be used. He was impressed with the variety of clients Chain brought together, as collaboration on Wall Street is rare. A lot of companies are facing the same problems with how to make blockchain a reality for their business, he said.\n\n\u201cWhile blockchain technology has a lot of potential, it will need to integrate with and co-exist with the financial system that exists today,\u201d he said.\n\nLudwin said blockchain has been validated on Wall Street, and now it\u2019s time to focus on creating solutions.\n\n\u201cPutting it all together is no small amount of work, nor is re-engineering business processes within large organizations,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018financial engineering.\u2019 This is software engineering that is going to reshape financial services.\u201d", "date": "2016-05-02 00:00:00", "title": "Inside the Secret Meeting Where Wall Street Tested Digital Cash"}

Venture financing is becoming more difficult to obtain in a slowing economy and wobbly stock market, and many Web startups that had been burning cash through big incentives to draw customers are facing pressure to cut their losses.\n\nMeituan and Dianping are among the larger players in the increasingly crowded online-to-offline space. A growing number of companies, Alibaba and Tencent among them, are betting rising incomes will drive online and mobile ordering of everyday services despite a decelerating economy.\n\nMeituan.com is a group-buying site similar to Groupon Inc., where people can get discounts on goods and services by making purchases together. It held about 52 percent of the 77 billion yuan ($12.1 billion) market in the first half of the year, according to a report by researcher Analysys International.\n\nDianping.com, which also runs a consumer review site like Yelp Inc., accounted for about 30 percent.

{"sourceurl": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-09/will-the-tesla-model-3-really-sell-for-25-000", "sourcename": "bloomberg", "response_body": "Tesla Motors Inc. was built with one overriding objective: to bring electric cars to the masses. After more than a decade of work, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk believes it\u2019s just about time. The company is set to begin taking pre-orders on its $35,000 Model 3 next month\u2014and by $35,000, Tesla really means as little as $25,000.\n\nTesla has confirmed that the $35,000 price tag on the Model 3 doesn't include the significant federal and state incentives available to electric car buyers. Official confirmation from the company echoes what Musk told reporters at an auto show more than a year ago: \"When I say $35,000, I'm talking about without any credits.\"\n\nThe distinction Tesla is making here between the price before and after tax subsidies is crucial; these tax incentives can knock off as much as $10,000 from the cost of purchase, drastically increasing the size of the market for the Model 3. The pre-subsidy price was increasingly in doubt after the company set the starting price of its Model X luxury SUV at $80,000, more than analysts initially expected .\n\n\"We can confirm it's $35,000 before incentives,\" a Tesla spokeswoman, Khobi Brooklyn, told Bloomberg. \"We haven't changed our minds.\"\n\nTo understand why pricing is so important, just look at what Americans are currently willing to spend. The average new car costs about $31,000, according to an analysis by Salim Morsy of Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Almost all the mass-market vehicles sold above that price threshold are SUVs and trucks. There's only one car comparable in size to the Model 3 that amasses more than 100,000 in annual sales with a $35,000 price tag: the BMW 3 Series.\n\nMass-Market Cars Need Mass-Market Prices\n\nSalim Morsy; BNEF\n\nA $25,000 Tesla would upend the U.S. auto market. Incentives vary widely state by state, but the base incentive is a $7,500 federal income tax credit available to everyone in the country. Bringing the $35,000 sticker price of the Model 3 down by that amount would expand the potential market by roughly 50 percent, according to Morsy. Additional incentives would further knock down the price in more than a dozen states, including an additional $6,000 in Colorado and $2,500 in California, Massachusetts, and Tennessee. The only limiting factor for sales of a Tesla in this price range would be the company's ability to crank out cars.\n\nThe chart below shows how U.S. car buyers are more willing to look at long-range electric cars once the purchase price drops. The cost of long-range electric cars (in green) is tumbling as Chevrolet, Tesla, and Nissan release their next-generation electric vehicles over the next two years. By 2030, an electric car at $22,500 would be a practical choice for almost 70 percent of car buyers (gray line).\n\nTotal addressable market for vehicles with a 200-mile range. Salim Morsy; BNEF\n\nTesla is facing intense scrutiny from investors after production delays for the ongoing rollout of its Model X SUV. The stock has tumbled 38 percent in 2016, wiping out $12 billion in market value. Pressure is already mounting for a speedy launch of the Model 3, which Musk says will go to production next year. Don't count on it.\n\nBig Potential, Tiny Window\n\nWhether anyone will actually get the Model 3 for $25,000 will depend on Tesla getting it to market on time, and running on schedule isn't Tesla's strong suit. The company is notorious for years-long delays for new products, from its original Roadster to the recent Model X. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, a longtime proponent of buying Tesla shares, doesn't believe Tesla's Model 3 will hit the streets until late 2018\u2014at least a year after Musk has promised it would appear.\n\nTo make matters worse for cash-strapped Tesla enthusiasts, the first cars off the production line probably won't be the sticker-price base model. Tesla likes to launch new products with a feature-rich Signature Series, which in the case of the Model X would cost about 75 percent more than the base model. For the Model 3, Jonas anticipates an initial average price of at least $60,000 before tax incentives.\n\nHere's where the road to a $25,000 Tesla gets a little twisted. The U.S. federal tax incentive for electric cars won't be around forever. It is designed to help ease carmakers into the electric market. The credit is applied to the first 200,000 electric sales for each new manufacturer; then the value of the incentive slowly fades to zero over about a year and a half.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nTesla is on track to reach its 200,000th sale around the middle of 2018. If Model 3 deliveries don't start until the end of 2018, and a higher-priced Signature Series soaks up the incentives for 2019, then by the time a \"mass-market\" buyer gets a shot at a lower-priced Model 3, the incentives could be gone. In that case, a $35,000 Tesla would just be a $35,000 Tesla. In the meantime, however, Chevy has plans to start selling its 200-mile-range Bolt for $30,000 by the end of 2016, which would mean beating Tesla to its goal of an affordable long-range electric car by a significant margin.\n\nFor now, Tesla insists the Model 3 is still on schedule for production starting next year. Khobi Brooklyn, the Tesla spokeswoman, declined to offer any details about the car beyond its sticker price. \"The Model 3 is on time, and everyone is going to learn more about it at the end of March,\" she said. \"That's when we've committed to talking about it and giving a really great update, and that's what we're going to do.\"\n\nWatch Next:Here's How Tesla Gets to 500,000 Sales a Year", "date": "2016-02-09 00:00:00", "title": "Electric Fantasy: Will the Next Tesla Sell for $25,000?"}

But on the best tool for fighting climate change, they agree.\n\nThe idea is to put a price on greenhouse-gas emissions: in its purest form, a carbon tax. It's the most effective way to cut emissions, and it's a policy supported by everyone from Al Gore to the biggest oil companies on earth.\n\nMore than 190 countries have come together in Paris over the past two weeks to forge a complex global pact to fight the looming environmental catastrophe. Unfortunately, the one policy everyone wants never really made it to the negotiating table.\n\nIn Paris, U.S. President Barack Obama and Elon Musk both spoke in support of a carbon tax. So did Exxon Mobil, joining a half-dozen other energy giants who came out in favor of one in June. A well-designed carbon tax can cut greenhouse-gas pollution in the most economically efficient way by letting market forces do the work. There are plenty of reasons to enact one:\n\n1. It has already been tested.\n\nSource: Bloomberg New Energy Finance\n\nCarbon pricing is spreading. In 2015, some 40 countries and more than 20 subnational governments had a price on emissions, either through a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system. They account for almost a quarter of global greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\n2. It's economical.\n\nThe idea of a carbon tax is elegant in its simplicity: minimize harmful forms of consumption by making them more expensive. Most countries already follow this strategy for products like alcohol and tobacco.\n\nAnd carbon taxes don't need to increase the size of a government's take: In some cases, they're offset by cuts to income and sales taxes. On the other hand, a carbon tax helps expand the clean-energy economy while cutting pollution-related costs paid by everyone.\n\n3.

Here\u2019s what we know so far:\n\nThere will only be one new car (for now).\n\nDespite some speculation to the contrary, there will only be one car unveiled in March: the Model 3 sedan. Rumors have circulated that Tesla might also unveil a Model Y crossover vehicle, but according to people familiar with Tesla\u2019s launch plans, this event will focus on the Model 3 exclusively.\n\nThis is the big one.\n\nIt\u2019s \"going to be probably the most profound car that we make,\u201d Elon Musk said. \"It will be a very compelling car at an affordable price.'' The Model 3 is now the company's top priority.\n\nIt\u2019s on schedule.\n\nThe unveiling of the Model 3 will take place in March, and pre-orders will begin immediately. Production will start in 2017.\n\nThe price is right.\n\nThe base model will cost $35,000, reportedly before government incentives, which in the U.S. range from $7,500 to more than $13,000, depending on the state.\n\n@elonmusk $35k price, unveil in March, preorders start then. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 2, 2015\n\nExpect fewer whistles.\n\nThe Model 3 is \u201cmeant to be a slightly smaller version of the Model S,\u201d Musk said in Hong Kong this week, \"and it won\u2019t have quite as many bells and whistles.\u201d In a November 2014 call with investors, Musk said the Model 3 would be about 20 percent smaller. Given the room freed up by the electric motor and Tesla\u2019s sub-floor batteries, it should still have more storage than a typical compact car.\n\nBells and whistles.

The recently announced 2017 Chevy Bolt will have a 60 kWh lithium-ion battery pack.

Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nThis will be Tesla\u2019s third auto platform: the Roadster, the Model S and X, and now the Model 3. To make the Model 3 affordable and adaptable, Tesla had to start from the ground up. \u201cFor better or worse, most of model 3 has to be new,\u201d Chief Technology Officer JB Straubel said in October. \"It\u2019s a new battery architecture, it\u2019s a new motor technology, brand new vehicle structure. It\u2019s a lot of work.\"\n\nAutonomous ready.\n\nHands off my Tesla. Photographer: David Paul Morris\n\nThe Model 3 will probably come equipped with the sensors for autonomous driving, even if Tesla requires additional fees to activate them. This week Musk predicted that in 10 to 15 years, all new cars will be autonomous. He also said roughly a third of people will forgo car ownership in favor of shared car services like Uber, or the Tesla equivalent (don\u2019t call it Tuber).\n\nLong warranty.\n\nThe Model 3 will have a warranty similar to that for the Model S, including an 8-year, infinite mile transferable warranty on the battery pack and drive unit, Musk said on Twitter in August 2014. That\u2019s important after Consumer Reports dinged the company last year for reports of excessive drivetrain problems.\n\nAbout that Model Y.\n\nWe know from a slide deck used by Tesla\u2019s Straubel that the company is planning a \u201cModel 3 Sedan & Crossover.\u201d The two vehicles will probably share the same chassis, battery, and motor platform. But the sedan will come first.\n\nX, Y, truck?\n\nMusk also wants a truck. It\u2019s probably next on his list after the Model 3 sedan and crossover. \u201cI think it is quite likely we will do a truck in the future,\u201d Musk said this week in Hong Kong. \u201cI think it\u2019s sort of a logical thing for us to do.\"\n\nThe Gigafactory is key.\n\nTesla\u2019s multibillion dollar battery factory in Nevada will be crucial for meeting Model 3 delivery demands. Batteries are the biggest single cost of production, and their price and supply are currently the biggest limiting factor for EV growth, according to Straubel.\n\nDon\u2019t call it the Model III.\n\nThe car's logo may be three parallel bars, but don\u2019t call it the Model III, Musk told followers on Twitter. The bars should be horizontal, similar to the stylized \u201cE\u201d in the Tesla logo. That\u2019s no mistake; Musk originally wanted to call it the Model E, in order to spell out \u201cSEX\u201d and then \u201cSEXY\u201d with his full lineup of Model names. He had to settle with \u201cModel 3\" because Ford wouldn\u2019t give up the trademark it owns.\n\nThis E is also a 3.\n\nWatch Next: Here's How Tesla Gets to 500,000 Sales a Year", "date": "2016-01-29 00:00:00", "title": "Everything We Know About Tesla\u2019s Secret Model 3...And Model Y"}
{"sourceurl": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-29/these-titans-of-oil-are-experts-at-making-bold-predictions", "sourcename": "bloomberg", "response_body": "Nobody saw it coming.\n\nOil prices had been sliding, but on Oct. 1, the future still looked bright. For the next three months, oil would average $97 a barrel, according to a Bloomberg survey of 36 analysts. The first quarter of 2015 would be even better. The most pessimistic among them called for $91 a barrel.\n\nHa.\n\nWe all know what happened next. The free-fall in oil prices was just getting started. WTI crude, the U.S. benchmark, would tumble from $107 a barrel in June to below $45 in January. Humbling, perhaps, but it hasn't quieted the bold predictions coming from CEOs, analysts, and energy ministers.\n\nHere's a look at some of the big calls made during the crash and how they've panned out.\n\nDon't Panic\n\n\"Let's not panic over the first little decline in oil prices,'' Whiting Petroleum CEO Jim Volker said on Sept. 22. He made more bold predictions:\n\n\"Saudi Arabia and the other OPEC members have already agreed to cut 500,000 barrels a day,'' he said, suggesting that OPEC would continue to support higher prices.\n\n\"I really don't think that there's anything to worry about with respect to the Bakken, or for that matter the Eagle Ford.''\n\n\"It always happens this time of the year... it's kind of a decline in the driving market after the summer holidays.''\n\nReality: Members of OPEC agreed to maintain their production targets instead of curbing output. The Williston Basin, home of the Bakken, and the Eagle Ford have both since lost more than half of their oil rigs. It wasn't just seasonal.\n\nNothing to Get Stress Tested About\n\n\"We have an $80 Brent case that is what we call our stress test,\" Hess CEO John B. Hess said in a Nov. 10 investor meeting. \"We don't think $80 Brent is likely.\"\n\nReality: Since then, Brent crude has averaged $60 a barrel.\n\nMorgan Stanley: 'More improvement ahead'\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts, including Adam Longson, forecast on Nov. 10 that Brent would average $106 a barrel in the fourth quarter and $107 for all of 2014, saying \"physical markets are strengthening with more improvement ahead, which should eventually lift prices.''\n\nReality: Nope.\n\nPickens the Futurist\n\n\"This has only been going on for 30 days. The world hasn't changed,\" T. Boone Pickens, chairman and CEO of BP Capital, said on Nov. 5. \"OPEC has got to have a better price for oil than $80 a barrel.\" Pickens added that the price of oil wouldn't drop to $70.\n\nReality: Brent crude dropped below $70 less than a month later and hasn't yet returned. OPEC either won't, or can't, lift prices. Whether the world has changed remains subjective.\n\nThe Bears Wake Up in January\n\nAfter the epic miscalculations of the fourth quarter, one might think at least a few overzealous bears would emerge. Think again. As of Jan. 1, the lowest of 30 estimates in a Bloomberg survey was for an average $50 oil for the first quarter. Not low enough. The actual price of WTI for the quarter: $48.57.\n\nStill, January and February were full of second guesses, with some of the most pessimistic outlooks of the price crash. Some analysts may have shifted too far, and done it too late:\n\nOil as cheap as $20 a barrel may soon be on the way, and the oil crash could spell the \"the end of OPEC,\" said Citigroup analyst Edward Morse on Feb. 9. Reality: There's been no $20 oil, or even $40 oil. OPEC hasn't yet dissolved.\n\nOil will probably continue to decline to as low as $30 a barrel, said Gary Cohn, president of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., on Jan. 26. \u201cWe\u2019re probably in the lower, longer view,\u201d said Cohn, himself a former oil trader. Reality: WTI finished that day around $45 a barrel and has rarely been lower since.\n\nOil could fall as low as $30 because supply surpluses won\u2019t disappear overnight, said Barclays analyst Miswin Mahesh on Feb 3. Reality: No $30 oil.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Ruble Warning\n\nIn January, Goldman Sachs made a big call on the Russian Ruble, cutting its 2015 outlook on concerns over cheap oil. Goldman said the ruble would weaken to 70 rubles per dollar from 63.\n\nReality: Instead, the ruble has strengthened, to 51 per dollar.\n\nSpecificity Doesn't Imply Accuracy\n\nBank of America analyst Francisco Blanch forecast in February that WTI would fall to $32 by the end of first quarter, and Brent would be $31.\n\nReality: The oil crash was bad. But not that bad. Even at its lowest, WTI never dipped below $43, and Brent stayed above $46.\n\nA Bad Call\n\nHarold Hamm, the billionaire founder of Continental Resources, cashed out his company's oil-crash hedges in October\u2014betting big on a rebound.\n\nReality: Oops\n\nA Good Call\n\nRenowned crude trader and commodities hedge fund manager Andy Hall said on Jan. 1 that oil would remain \"under pressure\" in 2015, but that $40 was close to an \"absolute price floor\" because it couldn't sell for long below the marginal cost of supply.\n\nReality: In the month before his call, crude had been in free-fall, declining about 30 percent to $53 a barrel. Oil has yet to fall below $40.\n\nOPEC Sees a Boomerang\n\nOPEC Secretary-General Abdalla El-Badri said on Jan. 26 week that prices would soon begin to rise and warned that oil could boomerang to $200 a barrel as the oil industry takes a cleaver to investment in new projects.\n\nReality: He may have correctly called the bottom to oil prices, but the $200 warning remains but a twinkle of hope in many an oil producer's eye.\n\n$90 in May?\n\n\"You're going to see $85 to $90 oil\" in the next 3-6 months, said John Catsimatidis, Red Apple Group Chairman, on Feb. 17.\n\nReality: His prediction has 1 to 4 months left to come true.\n\nShale Cuts\n\nEOG Resources Inc., the biggest independent shale driller, shocked the energy world in February when it announced plans to slash spending and halt oil production growth. The company was among the first to predict that crude output would decline.\n\nReality: The U.S. EIA is now saying the amount of oil produced from shale will decline in May.\n\nThe Frackers Will Fall\n\nThe most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.\n\nMost fracking companies in the U.S. will be dead or sold by year-end because of slashed spending by oil companies, said Rob Fulks, pressure pumping marketing director at Weatherford International.\u201cWe go by and we see yards are locked up and the doors are closed,\u201d Fulks said on April 22. There could be about 20 companies left, he said, down from 61 fracking service providers at the start of last year.\n\nReality: The number has already dropped to 41.\n\nBP: The Three-Year Slump\n\n\u201cThe fundamental supply and demand does remind me of 1986 a bit,\u201d said BP CEO Bob Dudley. Prices may stay below $60 for as long as three years, he said.\n\nReality: His prediction remains accurate, though prices have been creeping up to almost $60.\n\nSolar Will Be the Next Shale\n\n\"Just as shale extraction technologies reconfigured oil and gas markets, no other technology is closer to transforming power markets in a similar fashion than distributed and utility-scale solar,\" Prajit Gosh, research director for Americas Power & Renewables Research at Wood Mackenzie, said on Feb 2, 2015.\n\nReality: It will take years or decades to prove Gosh right, or wrong.\n\nElectric Cars Aren't an Oil Concern\n\nRyan Lance, CEO of ConocoPhillips, said on April 8 that it may take another 50 years for electric cars to have a material impact on oil demand.\n\nReality: Nearly every major carmaker as well as tech companies including Apple and Google are working on electric vehicles. Tesla and Chevy plan to release moderately priced cars with ranges of 200 miles or more per charge in the next few years.\n\nPredicting the Future\n\nAs bold predictions often go, many of the selections above have been proven wrong or increasingly unlikely. Since the beginning of the crash, analysts have diverged in their range of opinions, a reflection of just how difficult it is to predict the oil future. Here's where Wall Street sees oil prices headed, as of April 29.\n\nWith assistance from Lynn Doan, Dawn Kopecki, Robert Tuttle, Bradley Olson, Mark Chediak, Moming Zhou, Jim Polson, Reg Gale, Dan Murtaugh, Rebecca Penty, Margot Habiby and Matthew Philips.\n\nRead This Next:", "date": "2015-04-29 00:00:00", "title": "These Titans of Oil Are Experts at Making Bold Predictions*"}

Liu acknowledged the complexities in developing the system, without giving any indication of timing for its introduction.\n\n\u201cThe IPO registration system is an important task for the healthy development of the capital market,\u201d Liu said. \u201cI can clearly answer you that this has to be done. The question is about how to do it and to know how to implement.\u201d\n\nHe said it was too early to talk about the end of share purchases by China Securities Finance, the body that the government has used to prop up equities since last summer\u2019s rout. Last August, the CSRC said the fund will remain in the market for years to come. The fund now has stakes in almost 600 publicly traded companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cWe have high expectations in the new chairman,\u201d said Chu Ming Chuan, a member of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference and chairman of Asia Cassava Resources Holdings Ltd. \u201cWe hope the new chairman can fix the situation of volatile stocks that has hurt investor confidence.

The 66-year-old economics professor, together with Jaroslaw Kaczynski, co-founded the Center Alliance, which in 2001 was transformed into Law & Justice. The party swept to power in 2015 with wins in presidential and parliamentary elections after eight years in the opposition.\n\nAdam Glapinski Source: Narodowy Bank Polski\n\nWith five months left before the end of Belka\u2019s six-year term, Standard & Poor\u2019s shock downgrade of Poland\u2019s credit rating on Friday made the stakes clear. The zloty suffered its biggest rout since September 2011 and the government\u2019s local-currency bond yields jumped after S&P warned that Law & Justice\u2019s push to exert greater control over the state threatened the independence of institutions, \u201cmost importantly\u201d the central bank.

All of them will be nominated by Law & Justice -- which controls both houses of parliament -- and the party\u2019s ally, President Andrzej Duda.

ASX agreed to invest A$14.9 million ($10.5 million) into Digital Asset, joining other investors including JPMorgan, CME Group Inc. and ICAP Plc. The funding round was more than two times oversubscribed and values New York-based Digital Asset at $100 million, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nDigital Asset is among about a dozen startups that are racing to prove that blockchain, the technology underlying bitcoin, can be applied to financial markets. While in today\u2019s securities markets a central authority oversees the transfer of cash for shares, DAH aims to link all participants in that process on the same database to allow real-time movement of assets. While the aim in Australia is to reduce settlement times to minutes, regulators in the U.S. are currently working to cut it to two days from three.\n\nSimplifying Markets: ASX's Move to Speed Up Settlements\n\n\u201cWe can now trade equities in 150 microseconds, then it takes two days to\n\nsettle. That makes no sense,\u201d Elmer Funke Kupper, chief executive officer of ASX, said in an interview. \u201cA retail investor in Australia should be able to sell their shares, go to the nearest ATM and get their cash out.\u201d ASX said a year ago that it would replace all of its core technology systems. Digital Asset beat out 400 applicants for the contract to remake its clearing and settlement system. The Australian company invested about $10 million in Digital Asset, Funke Kupper said.\n\n\u201cThe moment we started to think about it, we realized that this is about much\n\nmore than replacing our back-office systems,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first opportunity in 20 years to re-engineer the way the market operates end-to-end. We should not miss that opportunity.\u201d\n\nNascent Technology\n\nAfter more than a year of enthusiastic talk about how the blockchain or distributed ledgers can transform finance, 2016 looks to be the year when those ideas are put to the test. Earlier this week, R3, a blockchain startup backed by 42 banks, said it successfully simulated trades of digital assets on a private network made up of 11 of its members. Overstock.com Inc. is close to unveiling the first securities-trading system using blockchain, while Nasdaq Inc. recently said it used the technology to complete and record a private securities transaction for the first time.\n\n\u201cFrom the outside this looks like the first real application of blockchain in a major clearing operation,\u201d said Rich Repetto, an exchange and brokerage analyst at Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP in New York. He said that so far it appears Nasdaq and ASX are out front in this new technology. \u201cIt\u2019s still early, but if anyone\u2019s going to get there it\u2019ll be the ones who are aggressive from the start,\u201d he said.\n\nThe most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.\n\nThe other investors in Digital Asset are Accenture Plc, Deutsche Boerse AG, Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., Citigroup Inc., BNP Paribas SA, Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc., PNC Financial Services Group Inc., Banco Santander SA and ABN AMRO Group NV. The board of directors of Digital Asset will grow to nine members from four, with added representatives from BNP Paribas, Deutsche Boerse, JPMorgan and DTCC and one as yet to be named, Masters said in an interview.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique cross-section of investors and customers who are investing a material amount of money in a technology that has the potential to transform their businesses,\u201d she said. Regarding the ASX investment and project, Masters said, \u201cIt\u2019s the first real, large-scale commercial project for any distributed ledger business. This is the first instance of something that\u2019s much more than hype.\u201d\n\nObstacles\n\nDistributed ledgers face obstacles to success. Fierce competitors will need to collaborate. Regulatory hurdles could kill or significantly slow progress. And although cross-border payment networks could save banks money, it would also drain revenue away from other parts of their business.\n\nAnother challenge is integrating new technology into existing systems, Masters said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. On the plus side, she said, distributed ledgers can make markets easier to regulate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the opportunity to enhance what regulators see and receive so you actually add to transparency,\u201d she said. Other financial products that could be overhauled using blockchain include fixed income, syndicated loans, foreign exchange settlements, and derivatives, Masters said.\n\nASX Warrants\n\nASX was granted the right to purchase warrants to increase its equity stake in Digital Asset and appoint a board member if certain conditions are met, Masters said. Two other types of warrants exist, according to a person familiar with the matter. The first are revenue warrants that would be rewarded to any customer or investor who brings in sales for Digital Asset, the person said.\n\nThe second type of warrant was issued to JPMorgan and can be exercised only if the bank works exclusively with Digital Asset on two different products that result in their widespread adoption, the person said. They were issued at the same cost of the other investments and all early investors had the chance to receive the warrants if they agreed to the terms, the person said.\n\nJPMorgan invested about $7.5 million in the round, according to a person familiar with the matter. Tasha Pelio, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to comment.\n\nASX is introducing blockchain to the world\u2019s 12th-biggest stock market, as measured by the $917 billion value of companies listed in Australia.\n\nFunke Kupper said he knew how difficult it will be to implement such a large change to his exchange. \u201cWe will need the support from investors, our clients, regulators and the government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start a journey of discovery.

Mobile revenue made up 56 percent of total sales in the quarter from 42 percent a year earlier.\n\nThe company\u2019s dominance in search as more users shift to using mobile devices is helping offset the impact of a Chinese economy growing at its slowest pace in 25 years.

Users of such services could rise 29 percent to 400 million by next year, according to Shanghai-based IResearch.\n\nThe rising cost of competing in online services is spurring consolidation, including the combinations last year of fashion sites Meilishuo and Mogujie, travel-site operators Ctrip and Qunar, and group-buying startups Meituan.com and Dianping.com.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world.

Selling IQiyi could expand Baidu\u2019s operating margins to 26 percent this year from 20 percent, even while unabated spending on on-demand services erases about 30 percentage points of profitability, HSBC Securities analysts led by Chi Tsang estimated. Spending on content rose too 7.4 percent of revenue in the quarter, from 4.4 percent a year ago.\n\n\u201cIn 2016, we also expect a step-up investment in content cost, but at a slightly more moderate pace than 2015,\" Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Li said.\n\nThe company also invests heavily on research and development. Baidu is exploring a sub-field of artificial intelligence known as deep learning, which aims to improve search results by training computers to work more like the human brain, and is researching autonomous driving. In 2014, the company hired Andrew Ng, a renowned robotics and machine-learning specialist to the post of chief scientist.\n\n\u201cSelf-driving cars can become a commercial product in the next five years,\u201d Robin Li said. \u201cThat is very dependent on our machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities.\u201d", "date": "2016-02-25 00:00:00", "title": "Baidu Sales Beat Analysts' Estimates on Mobile Search Growth"}

Nakamoto, the former defense industry and government employee emerged from his home in a Temple City neighborhood, briefly telling journalists \u201cI\u2019m not involved in Bitcoin.\u201d The group trailed him in a multivehicle car chase yesterday as he fled to an Associated Press bureau. The AP later wrote that he insisted during a two-hour interview that he first heard of Bitcoin when a reporter contacted his son last month.\n\nJournalists, bloggers and others have sought for years to identify the mysterious computer coder who wrote a paper on Bitcoin\u2019s framework and created the software that serves as its backbone. The initial document carried the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, and since the author or authors otherwise chose to remain private and anonymous, it had been widely assumed the name was a pseudonym.\n\nPublications such as the New Yorker have attempted to solve the mystery, examining possible Bitcoin founders that included a former cryptography student, a former programmer and economists.\n\nThe Nakamoto living in Temple City used to be named Satoshi and adopted the first name Dorian in 1973, Newsweek reported in its cover story. He was born in Japan, attended California State Polytechnic University, worked for defense contractors on classified military projects and eventually the Federal Aviation Administration, the magazine wrote.\n\n\u2018Not Involved\u2019\n\nAccording to Newsweek reporter Leah McGrath Goodman, when Dorian Nakamoto was confronted at his home before publication and asked about Bitcoin, he responded, \u201cI am no longer involved in that and cannot discuss it. It\u2019s been turned over to other people.\u201d\n\nHe told the AP that he was misunderstood.\n\n\u201cIt sounded like I was involved before with Bitcoin and looked like I\u2019m not involved now,\u201d it quoted him as saying. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I want to clarify that.\u201d\n\nNewsweek magazine defended Goodman\u2019s reporting.\n\n\u201cMs. Goodman\u2019s research was conducted under the same high editorial and ethical standards that have guided Newsweek for more than 80 years,\u201d the magazine said on its website today. \u201cNewsweek stands strongly behind Ms. Goodman and her article.\u201d\n\nSeeking Lunch\n\nEmerging from his home after the article was published, Dorian Nakamoto told reporters he would go to lunch with one of them. He picked an AP reporter, and they got in a blue Toyota Prius and headed for Mako Sushi in nearby Arcadia. Other reporters drove after them, and as Nakamoto saw he wasn\u2019t going to be left alone at the restaurant, he bolted again.\n\nHe and the reporter got back into the car and headed to the AP bureau in downtown Los Angeles. By mid-afternoon, a gaggle of non-AP reporters were standing outside the office waiting for him to come out.\n\nThe episode followed a day in which Bitcoin enthusiasts reacted to Newsweek\u2019s article with a mixture of resignation and disbelief, with some debating Dorian Nakamoto\u2019s possible role or whether he should have been left alone.\n\n\u201cFascinating,\u201d Martti Malmi, a Finnish programmer who worked with Nakamoto on the Bitcoin code, wrote on Twitter. \u201cSatoshi seems not much different than how I imagined him.\u201d\n\nLoose Group\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nGavin Andresen, the chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation who had been one of the few people to communicate with Satoshi Nakamoto, didn\u2019t immediately indicate whether he could identify Dorian Nakamoto as Bitcoin\u2019s creator. Andresen said in a message on Twitter that he regrets talking to the magazine about Nakamoto. He said he was disappointed that Newsweek decided to \u201cdox,\u201d or document, the Nakamoto family.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto has been thought to be a pseudonym for a programmer or group of programmers who wrote the paper and the initial source code for Bitcoin. The code has since been handed off to a loose group of experts affiliated with the foundation, a Seattle-based advocacy group.\n\nThe paper, first published in 2008, offered a proof of the basic concept of Bitcoin, which uses a public ledger and a network of voluntary computers, known as \u201cminers,\u201d to validate transactions that are signed with encrypted signatures. After the initial source code created the first batches of Bitcoin, it grew from an obsession of specialists into a global phenomenon.\n\nMt. Gox\n\nMerchants around the world now accept Bitcoin for everything from kitchen appliances on Overstock.com to luxury goods listed on BitPremier, a website. It also trades for traditional currencies, and was priced at $651.14 at 4 p.m. Hong Kong time today, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.\n\nBitcoin attracted media attention last week when Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the biggest exchange for the digital currency, filed for bankruptcy protection after coins valued at more than $500 million went missing. Following lawmaker calls for regulation, Japan\u2019s government said today that Bitcoin isn\u2019t a currency.\n\nSome Bitcoin enthusiasts said they were skeptical that Newsweek had found the right person. Others said they were furious that the news media would try to violate his privacy.\n\n\u201cI would have thought every Satoshi Nakamoto on planet Earth had already been contacted and ruled out,\u201d Stephen Pair, the chief technical officer at Atlanta-based BitPay, a payment processor. \u201cIf this person is the real Satoshi, it would be easy to for him to prove it if he wanted to.\u201d\n\nJeff Garzik, one of the core developers on the Bitcoin software protocol and an employee of BitPay, said \u201cthe \u2018real\u2019 Satoshi\u201d can prove his identity only through cryptography.\n\nDigital Signatures\n\n\u201cWe will know Satoshi by his digital signatures,\u201d Garzik said in an e-mail, adding that the founder could either sign a message using his unique encryption key or make use of the Bitcoins that the creator is known to have kept.\n\nAnalysts who looked at the Bitcoin ledger have concluded that the creator of the system owns about 1 million coins, worth over $600 million at current prices, said Jered Kenna, a San Francisco Bitcoin investor. If the owner pledged never to sell or trade them, it would help add stability to what has been a volatile market, Kenna said.\n\nAdam Draper, the chief executive officer of Boost, a San Mateo, California, company that incubates Bitcoin startups, called the Newsweek article \u201cintrusive\u201d and said he\u2019s unconvinced.\n\n\u201cIf Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to be anonymous the whole time, why would he use his real name on the paper?\u201d Draper said. \u201cHe always used non-tracking e-mails and did everything he could to stay anonymous, so it\u2019s difficult for me to understand why he would use his real name.\u201d\n\nIdentifying Bitcoin\u2019s founder won\u2019t affect the current network, said Gregory Maxwell, one of the core developers on the project. The code is now out of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s hands, and can\u2019t be changed except by broad consensus among the users of the network.\n\n\u201cThere has been extensive rewriting and reorganization since the time when the creator of the system ended his involvement,\u201d Maxwell said in an e-mail.", "date": "2014-03-06 00:00:00", "title": "Nakamoto Named as Bitcoin Creator Denies Involvement"}
{"sourceurl": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-30/the-final-days-of-the-bitcoin-foundation-", "sourcename": "bloomberg", "response_body": "Bruce Fenton, executive director at the Bitcoin Foundation, opened its Dec. 15 board meeting with a sense of urgency: \u201cWe need additional funds if we wish to retain employees.\u201d The numbers didn\u2019t look good. In two years, the foundation had seen at least $7 million evaporate. As of Nov. 30, its total assets stood at $12,553.06.\n\nTo sustain the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s operations, which have included lobbying, putting on conferences, and providing technical support for the digital currency, Fenton urged the group to find ways to raise money quickly. They considered cold-calling ex-members, and Fenton said he\u2019s working on marketing materials for prospective donors to explain the organization\u2019s purpose. \u201cThere is no material saying what the foundation does,\u201d he said.\n\nEventually, Jim Harper, a board member and senior fellow at Cato Institute, a think tank, interjected. He questioned whether the foundation was offering its members enough value to warrant its existence, according to minutes released on Dec. 21 from the meeting. \u201cAsking for money is just throwing money away,\u201d Harper said. Olivier Janssens, another director, suggested that the organization may not be \u201cfixable.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin Foundation has become a symbol of the challenges facing the digital asset it was designed to steward. While advocates have promoted bitcoin as a global, decentralized currency for the Internet age, it\u2019s proved to be more volatile than many penny stocks. Its role in money laundering and other illegal activity is a constant source of questions, and the price fluctuates with each regulatory clampdown or criminal investigation. In November 2013, it reached a high of $1,137 before falling to $183 in January 2015 following a slew of problems, including the collapse of Mt. Gox, once the world\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange.\n\nPolice officers carry pieces of evidence from the house of Mark Karpel\u00e8s, head of defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, in Tokyo on Aug. 3. Photographer: Jiji Press/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBeyond financial trouble, two former Bitcoin Foundation board members have been charged with crimes. Mark Karpel\u00e8s, former chief executive officer of Mt. Gox, was arrested in Tokyo and charged with embezzlement in September. Charlie Shrem, former vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, resigned before pleading guilty to helping launder money for transactions through the illicit online marketplace Silk Road. He\u2019s currently serving two years in a federal prison.\n\nSeveral people still involved with the Bitcoin Foundation said the wounds may never heal. \u201cI don't know if the foundation has a future,\u201d Gavin Andresen, a former board member who now holds the title of chief scientist, wrote in an e-mail. \u201cIt is very difficult to regain trust once trust has been lost, and the illegal behavior of two of the foundation's former board members destroyed a lot of trust.\u201d\n\nWhen the Bitcoin Foundation was formed in 2012, the group was intended to give legitimacy to a relatively unknown technology. By the end of that year, bitcoin traded at about $13. The organization grew almost in lockstep with the popularity of bitcoin. Comprising pioneering coders and entrepreneurs behind the digital currency, the Bitcoin Foundation would soon become a familiar face in Washington, spreading the gospel of bitcoin around the world.\n\nU.S. lawmakers and congressional committees appreciated having a central figure to represent bitcoin, but foundation members have sometimes become punching bags for politicians. At an event in 2013 attended by Andresen, who was appointed to lead bitcoin development by the anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, a Justice Department prosecutor compared bitcoin with child pornography, according to a report in the Washington Post.\n\nA man named Satoshi Nakamoto, one of many people believed to be the creator of bitcoin, fends off photographers. He's denied involvement. Photographer: Allen J. Schaben/LA Times via Getty Images\n\nTechies bought into the promises of bitcoin and were eager to donate to further its cause. At the end of 2013, the Bitcoin Foundation reported $7 million in assets, according to meeting minutes. As demand for bitcoins rose, so did the value of the foundation\u2019s funds, much of which were held in the digital currency. In 2014, its ambitions began expanding with the addition of a lobbying operation in Europe.\n\nThen things changed. By mid-2014, funds were down to $4.6 million, and the burst of the bitcoin bubble that year took a toll on the foundation almost immediately. \u201cI hired lobbying in Brussels in 2014, and then we scaled it right back because the money was gone,\u201d Harper said in an interview after the contentious Dec. 15 board meeting. According to the minutes from that meeting, the organization has cut its budget by 95 percent from previous years. Its conference business now faces stiff competition from other events, such as Inside Bitcoins and Money20/20.\n\nAbout a year ago, when bitcoin\u2019s price had fallen to about $374, the foundation said it would discontinue public policy efforts and concentrate on providing technical development to bitcoin. The reason was simple: It didn\u2019t have the money to do both. \u201cIt thrived while the bitcoin price was rising, so it never put a plan in place to sustain it,\u201d Harper said. \u201cWhen the price dropped, the foundation ran out of money. The last year has just been cutting costs, shrinking budgets, bringing things under control.\u201d\n\nThe pressure revealed the foundation\u2019s underlying weaknesses. Supporters were inexperienced at raising money, and until recently, few paid attention to expenses, Harper said. \u201cThey were spending thousands of dollars per month on Web services that would have cost a couple hundred,\u201d he said. Bobby Lee, a Bitcoin Foundation board member, acknowledged \u201cbudget and leadership problems in the past\u201d and referred questions about expenses to Fenton, who said he\u2019s made the organization more transparent since he joined in April. \u201cThere were a lot of bad decisions and a lot of lost money,\u201d Fenton said. \u201cIt\u2019s really a very different organization. It\u2019s a new organization, other than the name.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has weathered hard times better than the foundation has. The price is back up to $426. Venture capital firms have invested more than $1 billion in bitcoin-related startups, according to research from CoinDesk. Finance and tech companies, including IBM, Overstock, Nasdaq, and the biggest banks, are experimenting with the technology for use in everything from money transfers and contracts to issuing stock. Coin Center, a year-old organization with backers such as BitPay, has staff in Washington developing bitcoin policy. There\u2019s also the Digital Chamber of Commerce, a trade association. Those two organizations recently formed the Blockchain Alliance to help law enforcement investigate criminal activity involving bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology.\n\nRoger Ver, whose evangelism for the digital currency earned him the name Bitcoin Jesus, provided the Bitcoin Foundation with funds early on. An ex-convict who had been sentenced to 10 months in federal prison after selling about 14 pounds of explosives without a license on EBay, Ver said the foundation\u2019s demise, if it were to happen, wouldn\u2019t affect bitcoin. \u201cThere are lots of different bitcoin foundations, so the name may change, but the mission will carry on,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it matters at all if the Bitcoin Foundation were to close. The Bitcoin Foundation laid the groundwork for the ecosystem that we have today.\u201d\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nBut Lee is determined to resuscitate his organization. \u201cDespite the recent negativity about the Bitcoin Foundation, there are still many people who believe in the need for a global non-profit platform that advocates for bitcoin,\u201d Lee wrote in an e-mail. \u201cThe past 18 months were tough for bitcoin and its entire ecosystem; I did not give up on bitcoin then, and I will not give up on Bitcoin Foundation today.\u201d\n\nAt the December board meeting, Lee suggested that dissenters should resign. \u201cIf someone does not want to be on that ship, they should step off the board,\u201d Lee said. After much debate, Janssens and Harper elected to dissolve the organization, but they were outvoted by Lee and the two other directors.\n\nBy the end of the meeting, Harper agreed to step down, and Janssens was removed from the board. \u201cNone of this is personal,\u201d said Chairman Brock Pierce. The two ousted men were dismissed. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me,\u201d Janssens said. \u201cI was removed for a bulls--- reason.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 22, the Bitcoin Foundation said it appointed three new board members. The foundation is also considering a revised mission statement, with a focus on technical development, advocacy, and regulatory efforts. Finally, the board \u201cvoted to continue the existence of the foundation\u201d and established an optional board seat for bitcoin\u2019s mysterious creator, \u201cif and when Satoshi ever reveals him or herself.\u201d", "date": "2015-12-30 00:00:00", "title": "The Final Days of the Bitcoin Foundation?"}

Venture capital investments topped $1 billion for the first time. People are finding it easier to invest in the digital currency, thanks to the debut of firms such as Bitcoin Investment Trust. Big financial companies\u2014Nasdaq, American Express and Visa\u2014 invested in bitcoin startups, \"a game changer in terms of attitude towards the technology,\" said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.\n\nSo what's in store for 2016? We'll probably see the first bitcoin company valued at more than $1 billion, a self-imposed slowdown in new bitcoin production (which will put some miners out of business) and more financial institutions embracing the currency and its technology. The main unknowns are the price, consumer adoption and\u2014as always\u2014the real identity of bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. This all comes as bitcoin trades near year-highs, at around $438 on Friday.\n\n\"Should be a revealing year for Bitcoin,\" Tim Draper, a venture capitalist who's bought bitcoins and invested in related startups, wrote in an e-mail. \"I expect some of the consumer applications to come to light. I expect the U.S. government to finally recognize Bitcoin as a currency. I expect to hear of the first Bitcoin unicorn (Coinbase maybe).\"\n\nHere are some of the developments seen for bitcoin in 2016:\n\nBitcoin Halving\n\nNew bitcoins are generated all the time, when operators of number-crunching computers called miners solve complex equations and record every transaction. The number of bitcoins that can be generated, however, is limited by design in the digital currency's underlying software. Once every four years, the number of bitcoins that miners can harvest every 10 minutes is cut in half. Summer 2016 marks four years since the last halving, with the cap set to drop to 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes. That's bad news for some miners, especially those with older machines. \"They are just going gangbusters and trying to mine as much as possible,\" said Bobby Lee, CEO of Chinese bitcoin exchange and mining pool BTCC. With fewer new bitcoins floating around, the price of the virtual currency could climb in value, he said.\n\nBlock Size\n\nData in the bitcoin network is stored in chunks called blocks. The problem is, some worry that as more people use and buy bitcoin, the network will run into bottlenecks and dramatically slow down. Some propose changing the block size to solve the problem. \"One of the most important things I'd like to see happen is consensus from all the parties involved in bitcoin on how we should move forward,\" said Charlie Lee, Bobby's brother as well as director of engineering at Coinbase and creator of bitcoin rival Litecoin.\n\nFinancial Industry\n\nBarry Silbert, whose company runs Bitcoin Investment Trust, recently predicted that Wall Street will begin to trade bitcoin, according to a participant at a private investor event. Traditional banks, which have long stayed away from bitcoin startups, will begin to work with these companies, he said.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nFinancial firms will also continue to look at the blockchain, bitcoin's underlying technology, to use in secure transactions. While they may not directly use bitcoin, a blockchain could help verify any financial transaction, from a share trade to a bond coupon payment. R3, a startup, has gathered 30 banks including Citigroup and Bank of America to develop standards and a technology the financial institutions could use. It hopes to unveil initial results next year, said R3 spokesman Charley Cooper.\n\nAt the same time, more institutional investors may start trading bitcoin. \"As an ecosystem, we've only just begun to scratch the surface of institutional involvement,\" said Tyler Winklevoss, an investor in bitcoin exchange Gemini.\n\nStartup Busts\n\nWith hundreds of bitcoin companies vying for business, there won't be enough money to go around. More bitcoin startups could merge or go out of business, Silbert predicted.\n\nOne cause for that will probably be the lower-than-anticipated pace of consumer bitcoin adoption. Sharp swings in the digital money's value against the dollar and other currencies will continue to turn off users and make bitcoin impractical for everyday purchases.", "date": "2015-12-11 00:00:00", "title": "Bitcoin: What's in Store for 2016"}

But a steady drip of production delays and lowered sales forecasts have caused some to question whether his 500,000-car goal is still possible, if it ever was. Here are three charts that show reason for both skepticism and hope.\n\nData compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nLast week Tesla backed off its full-year production forecast by about 5,000 deliveries. The 2016 forecast was also nudged down to a weekly average rate between 1,600 and 1,800\u2014down from a previous target of 2,000. Missed deadlines are nothing new for Musk and his car company. The Model X SUV, once promised for 2014, won't be released until this September; the mass market Model 3 is currently slated for late 2017.\n\nData compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe problem with placing bets on Tesla\u2019s future is that there are few examples to compare it with. He's building an entirely new kind of automobile\u2014a battery-powered car that goes zero to 60 miles per hour in just 2.8 seconds and runs for almost 300 miles on a single charge. To accomplish these goals, he has completely reimagined the manufacturing process and undertaken construction of one of the world's biggest factories, just to supply the batteries.\n\nWhen has another startup tried to do so much, so quickly? There\u2019s really only one example, the original game changer: Ford Motor's Model T. Here's how the trajectories of Elon Musk and Henry Ford match up:\n\nData compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nOf course, this isn't the first time Musk has been compared to Ford, but the parallel in the production data is striking. Tesla first surpassed 10,000 deliveries in 2013\u2014the same milestone Ford hit in 1909. By 1916\u2014just seven years later\u2014the Model T hit Musk\u2019s goal right on schedule and produced 501,462 cars. Maybe the 2020 plan isn't out reach for Tesla.\n\n\"I do remain confident about half a million cars in 2020, and maybe being able to exceed that,\" Musk said on a conference call with investors last week, after an analyst asked whether he still stood behind the forecast. \"That's five years from now. If you go five years in the past for Tesla, we were producing 600 cars per year\u2014now we can produce 600 cars in three days. So I think going from here to 500,000 cars a year is a much smaller leap.\"\n\nTesla is already making some of the fastest-driving cars in the world.

It\u2019s the biggest deal of its kind for a U.S. company operating in China. For China, the deal is only a beginning.\n\nChina has been installing more renewable-power capacity than fossil fuels for several years, a gap that's growing. In 2015, China will install 15 gigawatts to 18 gw of solar power alone, double the solar deployment in the U.S., according to an analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF).\n\nThe chart below shows how, in the next 15 years, China is on track to have more low-carbon electricity than the entire capacity of the U.S. power grid. \"Think of what their grid will look like in 2030,\" Michael Liebreich, founder of BNEF, said at the organization's annual summit last week in New York. \"A very competitive advantage.\"\n\nThe New King of Clean Energy\n\nPower in gigawatts. \"Low-carbon\" includes hydro and nuclear. Source: BNEF\n\nFor Apple, the 40-megawatt partnership extends Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook's solar aspirations beyond U.S. borders. Cook announced an $850 million deal in February to purchase enough solar to power all its California operations: stores, offices, headquarters, and a data center. By making a similar push in China, the tech giant begins to offset its considerable manufacturing pollution, which is almost entirely overseas.\n\nMany U.S. tech giants\u2014not just Apple\u2014have been criticized for outsourcing their pollution, says Justin Wu, head of Asia research for BNEF. Apple is \"hitting back at that whole line of arguments,\" he says. \"This is the beginning of something.

Officials drafting Li\u2019s address for the opening of the annual full-session of the National People\u2019s Congress decided not to mention the system because they judged it unlikely to be realized in 2016, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the discussions were private.\n\nLi had explicitly mentioned the registration system in both his 2014 and 2015 work reports. In this year\u2019s address, he only pledged to \u201cmove forward with the reform of stock and bond markets and increase the level of rule of law in their development.\u201d He also called for speeding regulatory improvements to cover all financial risks.\n\nThe year since Li mentioned the registration system in his 2015 work report has been a tumultuous one for China\u2019s stock market. A rout last summer wiped out $5 trillion of market value, followed by the January removal of trading circuit breakers less than a week after their introduction and capped off last month by Liu Shiyu replacing Xiao Gang as head of the stocks regulator. Authorities are also studying a merger of stock market, banking and insurance regulators into one agency, people familiar with the plans said last week.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nWhile pushing back timing for the revamp is bad news for the more than 700 companies that have IPO applications pending with the CSRC, it does offer some respite to Chinese stock investors. Under the existing system, new listings are often priced cheaply due to the regulator\u2019s controls, meaning IPOs are well supported when they start trading, and offer safe havens from the bear market in equities.\n\nCalls to the CSRC seeking comment during the weekend went unanswered. In a Feb. 26 statement, CSRC spokesman Deng Ge acknowledged that the various studies involved with changing the IPO process would require a \u201crelatively long time,\u201d adding that the realignment is the \u201cdirection of China\u2019s capital market reform.\u201d\n\nThe two-year window granted to the CSRC theoretically allowed the registration system to be introduced as early as March 1. Huatai Securities Co. says it\u2019s not likely to happen until 2017 as the regulator allays investor concerns about a more market-reliant process that may damp IPO returns.\n\nThe CSRC imposed an unwritten rule in 2014 that caps IPO valuations under the existing listing system at 23 times earnings. The market-based registration model, if currently active, would see some smaller companies listed closer to the 55 times that the ChiNext Index traded at as of March 4.\n\nLast year\u2019s listings posted an average offer-to-date gain of 155 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Some 220 companies completed IPOs in 2015, compared with 128 in 2014 after a yearlong suspension of new sales as the securities regulator drafted rules aimed at curbing fraud and beefing up protection for investors.\n\n\u201cLiberalization is still the future direction,\u201d Luo Yi, a Shenzhen-based analyst at Huatai Securities, said in a Feb. 28 note. \u201cThe regulator will gradually loosen up the process and free up pricing as market expectation becomes stable, and the soonest this could happen may be in 2017.\u201d\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Keith Zhai", "date": "2016-03-06 00:00:00", "title": "China Streamlining IPO Rules Said to Be Unlikely This Year"}

Trillions of dollars will be invested over the next 25 years, driving some of the most profound changes yet in how humans get their electricity. That's according to a new forecast by Bloomberg New Energy Finance that plots out global power markets to 2040.\n\nHere are six massive shifts coming soon to power markets near you:\n\n1. Solar Prices Keep Crashing\n\nThe price of solar power will continue to fall, until it becomes the cheapest form of power in a rapidly expanding number of national markets. By 2026, utility-scale solar will be competitive for the majority of the world, according to BNEF. The lifetime cost of a photovoltaic solar-power plant will drop by almost half over the next 25 years, even as the prices of fossil fuels creep higher.\n\nSolar power will eventually get so cheap that it will outcompete new fossil-fuel plants and even start to supplant some existing coal and gas plants, potentially stranding billions in fossil-fuel infrastructure. The industrial age was built on coal. The next 25 years will be the end of its dominance.\n\n2. Solar Billions Become Solar Trillions\n\nWith solar power so cheap, investments will surge. Expect $3.7 trillion in solar investments between now and 2040, according to BNEF. Solar alone will account for more than a third of new power capacity worldwide. Here's how that looks on a chart, with solar appropriately dressed in yellow and fossil fuels in pernicious gray:\n\nElectricity capacity additions, in gigawatts Source: BNEF\n\n\n\n3. The Revolution Will Be Decentralized\n\nThe biggest solar revolution will take place on rooftops. High electricity prices and cheap residential battery storage will make small-scale rooftop solar ever more attractive, driving a 17-fold increase in installations. By 2040, rooftop solar will be cheaper than electricity from the grid in every major economy, and almost 13 percent of electricity worldwide will be generated from small-scale solar systems.\n\n$2.2 Trillion Goes to Rooftops by 2040\n\nRooftop (small-scale) solar in yellow. Renewables account for about two-thirds of investment over the next 25 years.\n\n4. Global Demand Slows\n\nYes, the world is inundated with mobile phones, flat screen TVs, and air conditioners. But growth in demand for electricity is slowing. The reason: efficiency. To cram huge amounts of processing power into pocket-sized gadgets, engineers have had to focus on how to keep those gadgets from overheating. That's meant huge advances in energy efficiency. Switching to an LED light bulb, for example, can reduce electricity consumption by more than 80 percent.\n\nSo even as people rise from poverty to middle class faster than ever, BNEF predicts that global electricity consumption will remain relatively flat. In the next 25 years, global demand will grow about 1.8 percent a year, compared with 3 percent a year from 1990 to 2012. In wealthy OECD countries, power demand will actually decline.\n\nThis watercolor chart compares economic growth to energy efficiency. Each color represents a country or region. As economies get richer, growth requires less power.\n\nThe Beauty of Efficiency\n\nSource: BNEF\n\n5. Natural Gas Burns Briefly\n\nNatural gas won't become the oft-idealized \"bridge fuel\" that transitions the world from coal to renewable energy, according to BNEF. The U.S. fracking boom will help bring global prices down some, but few countries outside the U.S. will replace coal plants with natural gas. Instead, developing countries will often opt for some combination of coal, gas, and renewables.\n\nEven in the fracking-rich U.S., wind power will be cheaper than building new gas plants by 2023, and utility-scale solar will be cheaper than gas by 2036.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nFossil fuels aren't going to suddenly disappear. They'll retain a 44 percent share of total electricity generation in 2040 (down from two thirds today), much of which will come from legacy plants that are cheaper to run than shut down. Developing countries will be responsible for 99 percent of new coal plants and 86 percent of new gas-fired plants between now and 2040, according to BNEF. Coal is clearly on its way out, but in developing countries that need to add capacity quickly, coal-power additions will be roughly equivalent to utility-scale solar.\n\nSource: BNEF\n\n6. The Climate Is Still Screwed\n\nThe shift to renewables is happening shockingly fast, but not fast enough to prevent perilous levels of global warming.\n\nAbout $8 trillion, or two thirds of the world's spending on new power capacity over the next 25 years, will go toward renewables.

That\u2019s what some analysts are saying about the price of nickel, a metal used in making stainless steel that was supposed to surge last year but instead plunged to a 12-year low.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nWhile the slump of 2015 has continued this month, the consensus forecast is that the long-expected reduction in supplies will finally materialize. The bet is that users will draw down inventories, mine output will shrink because most of the industry is losing money, and demand will improve in China, the world\u2019s biggest consumer. That should spark a rally, albeit from prices that are 44 percent lower than a year ago, the bulls contend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a brave person that comes out and says there\u2019s going to be a strong rally,\u201d Caroline Bain, a senior commodities consultant at Capital Economics Ltd., said by phone from London. \u201cI\u2019m a bit cautious that we can have a big rally, but at least all the indicators are pointing in the right direction. The main thing is there is a deficit now, so we do expect to see some of the stocks to start to come off.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what was supposed to happen last year, when prices fell short of the consensus target by about a third. After Indonesia, the world\u2019s largest producer of nickel ore, banned exports in 2014, prices jumped to a two-year high and banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted global shortages in 2015. Instead, supplies from the Philippines proved more than adequate, China\u2019s stainless-steel industry slowed and inventories ballooned. Last year, prices fell more than any other base metal on the LME.\n\nWhile forecasts have been slashed, nickel will average $12,250 a metric ton in 2016, according to the median estimate of 16 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s up about 49 percent from Tuesday\u2019s close of $8,240 and is the biggest gain expected for base metals.\n\n\u201cThroughout last year, people were looking for stocks to come under control, but that\u2019s taken much longer than expected,\u201d Mark Beveridge, a senior consultant for stainless steel at CRU Group in London, said in a phone interview on Jan. 6.\n\nInventories tracked by the LME ended last year at 441,294 tons, down 6 percent from a record high of 470,376 tons in June, exchange data show.\n\nSteel Buildings\n\nChina\u2019s stainless-steel output will rise this year, rebounding from its first decline in seven years, helped by demand from government-backed infrastructure projects, Beveridge said. Stainless steel used in buildings and cars tends to have higher nickel content than metal used in things like white goods and kitchen cutlery, he said.\n\n\u201cActual consumption in China is not as negative as people assume it might have been,\u201d and could improve toward the end of this year, \u201cbased on the assumption there is a gradual improvement in manufacturing and the construction sector doesn\u2019t blow up,\u201d said Beveridge.\n\nGlencore Plc said last month that its Murrin Murrin mine in Australia may be shut, adding that as much as 70 percent of global output was unprofitable. BlackRock Inc., the world\u2019s largest asset manager and Glencore\u2019s fourth-biggest shareholder, has questionedhow much longer the nickel industry can continue to operate unprofitable mines.\n\nNickel smelters in China, the largest producer, in November announced a plan to cut output in 2016 by at least 20 percent in a bid to shore up prices.\n\nMore Cautious\n\nGMK Norilsk Nickel PJSC, which vies with Brazil\u2019s Vale SA as the world\u2019s biggest producer, indicated it doesn\u2019t expect prices to do much in the near term. The Russian company\u2019s financial plan for 2016, approved last month, anticipates an average of about $9,000 a ton, said two people familiar with the situation.\n\nIt\u2019s still possible prices will keep falling. Output cuts at mines outside of China have been minimal and disappointing so far, Goldman Sachs said in a note dated Dec. 21 that predicted a continuation of weak fundamentals.\n\nAnother ominous sign is that LME-tracked inventories jumped at the end of 2015, which may signal demand is even weaker than expected in China, said Ivan Szpakowski, commodities strategist at Citigroup Inc.\n\n\u201cThe speed and concentration of the deliveries in largely Asian locations suggests in our view that very little of the metal removed from LME warehouses between June and early December was demand-related,\u201d Szpakowski said in a note.\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Martin Ritchie, and Keith Gosman", "date": "2016-01-13 00:00:00", "title": "This Bet Requires Stubborn Faith After Nickel's Epic 2015 Fail"}

Citing an \u201cextremely challenging\u201d market, Woodside said the Browse venture will prepare a new plan and budget for developing the gas resources off Western Australia.\n\nMore than $400 billion of proposed energy projects have been delayed since mid-2014 and pushed into 2017 and beyond as oil prices slid about 60 percent in the past two years, according to consulting firm Wood Mackenzie Ltd.

The company said last month that the project needed further cost reductions and didn\u2019t have any firm sales.\n\nThe floating LNG project would have cost 35 percent less than a previous plan to develop Browse with an onshore plant in Western Australia, Woodside Chief Executive Officer Peter Coleman said in a phone interview. That original project was estimated to cost more than A$80 billion ($61 billion).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very difficult for us to invest in this price environment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe move by Woodside raises questions about the viability of other large LNG projects waiting to be developed, including ventures in Canada and Mozambique and floating LNG proposals in particular, Beveridge wrote in a report.\n\nMark Wiseman, a Sydney-based analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in a report last month that at current oil prices Browse was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d to make significant progress toward approval.\n\nPhases\n\nShares in the company dropped 0.9 percent to close at A$27.13 in Sydney, taking their decline this year to 5.5 percent.\n\n\u201cWoodside remains committed to the earliest commercial development of the world-class Browse resources and to FLNG as the preferred solution, but the economic environment is not supportive of a major LNG investment at this time,\u201d Coleman said in the statement.\n\nPetroChina Co., BP and Japan Australia LNG Pty, a venture between Mitsubishi Corp. and Mitsui & Co., are also partners in Browse, according to Woodside\u2019s website. UBS Group AG in 2014 estimated that developing the three Browse fields would cost about $40 billion.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, Woodside\u2019s focus will be on delivering phased and sustainable developments that balance capital exposure and revenue with the realities of the commodities cycle,\u201d Coleman said in a separate e-mailed statement.", "date": "2016-03-22 00:00:00", "title": "Woodside Scraps $40 Billion LNG Project After Price Collapse"}

Then Qunar\u2019s largest shareholder, Baidu Inc., forced it into a deal that gave Ctrip control over the combined entity, according to a person familiar with the matter. Qunar\u2019s management learned their fate only two days before the announcement, the person said.\n\nChina\u2019s Internet market, after a surge in startups and record venture-capital investments, is entering a new phase of consolidation as investors grow weary of money-losing battles for customers and push for profitability. Acquisitions by Chinese companies rose 75 percent this year to $413.2 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, with domestic deals in the Internet industry nearly quadrupling to $55.6 billion.\n\n\u201cInvestors and VCs are beginning to worry about the sustainability of these models,\u201d said Li Muzhi, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Arete Research Service LLP. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are the founder or a professional management team, if the money says no, then it\u2019s a no.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s biggest Internet companies -- Baidu, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., known collectively as BAT -- are driving the consolidation, accounting for more than 40 percent of domestic dealmaking in the industry.

The deals have helped boost Tencent shares more than 35 percent this year.\n\nDeals Double\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nThe waves of deals started in February when Alibaba and Tencent merged their competing taxi-hailing applications to create Didi Kuaidi, creating a clear leader with more heft to hold off Uber Technologies Inc. Classified-ad provider 58.com Inc. followed in April, buying control of rival Ganji.com while also getting additional funding from Tencent. Then last month, the group buying and review startups Meituan.com and Dianping.com, separately backed by Alibaba and Tencent, respectively, agreed to combine into a $15 billion giant.\n\nThe deals come as venture-capital investments in China surged this year to about $29 billion, double the amount for all of last year.\n\n\u201cThere was an abundance of capital that created this group of competitors, and that now brings out the need for strategic consolidation,\u201d said Zhang Xiaoyin, head of China telecom, media and technology investment banking at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \u201cThe deals are for the good of the company even if it may not be the way that the founders prefer.\u201d\n\nFor Meituan\u2019s investors, money was the driver. Meituan agreed to the merger only after it had unsuccessfully tried to raise money at a valuation of $15 billion. Instead, it settled for about two-thirds of that, a person familiar with the matter said last month.\n\nInternet \u2018Kingmakers\u2019\n\nQunar, whose shares trade on Nasdaq, has been facing mounting losses amid the intense competition in China. Part of its trouble was the unraveling of a deal in which Baidu was supposed to deliver Internet traffic to their site. As users shifted from desktop PCs to smartphones, the agreement yielded less traffic than expected.\n\nEven when Qunar raised $800 million this year amid losses, it couldn\u2019t escape the shadow of competition. A few days later, Ctrip said it had raised $1 billion. Baidu finally had enough. It agreed to put its Qunar shares into a combined entity with Ctrip, essentially forcing Qunar\u2019s management into the deal without consulting them.\n\n\u201cBaidu, Alibaba and Tencent have become kingmakers,\u201d said Richard Robinson, who teaches at Peking University\u2019s business school and mentors startups in Beijing.\n\nThe deals also reach into the public sector. China\u2019s government is reforming many of the nation\u2019s state-owned enterprises, resulting in more M&A activity. In the biggest such deal, the three wireless carriers are combining their tower assets in a $36 billion combination.\n\nThe Internet dealmaking is far from over. China\u2019s food-delivery firms are potential candidates for their own round of consolidation after going through major funding rounds this summer. Tencent-backed Ele.me raised $630 million, valuing the company at $3 billion in August, while Alibaba and its financial arm invested almost $1 billion in Koubei Co. in June.\n\n\u201cA lot of companies are using similar business models trying to subsidize consumers,\u201d said Xia Mingchen, a principal at private equity firm Hamilton Lane Advisors LLC. \u201cMany of these types of companies won\u2019t survive.\u201d", "date": "2015-11-04 00:00:00", "title": "Alibaba, Baidu Turn `Kingmakers' as China Sees Dealmaking Surge"}

The government will increase its deficit as it shells out more funds to underpin growth and buffer the effects of job cuts in bloated state-run enterprises, Li said.\n\n\"China\u2019s economy absolutely will not have a hard landing, the so called hard-landing predictions are bound to fall through,\" said Xu Shaoshi, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, said Sunday at a press conference in Beijing when asked about recent remarks by Soros.\n\nThe economy is facing headwinds, and risks such as declining government revenue, falling prices for industrial commodities and declines in corporate profit \"should not be under-estimated,\" Xu said. Global factors from financial market fluctuations to geopolitical risk may also impact growth, he said.\n\nDespite the risks, China is achieving its planned rebalance from investment and manufacturing-driven growth to a model based on expanding services and consumer spending, with new businesses and sectors growing rapidly, he said. China will use macro-economic measures to boost consumption, pursue a stable level of foreign trade, and increase effective investment to carry out the economic restructuring, Xu said.\n\nGlobal Growth\n\nChina remains an engine for global growth and is not exporting its slowdown and market volatility as some have said, according to Xu. China accounted for about 15 percent of the world\u2019s $73 trillion economy, compared with 24 percent for the United States.\n\nRising volumes of Chinese imports especially of commodities from crude oil to iron ore and fertilizers, as well as a 14.7 percent increase in non-financial foreign direct investment last year, are also positive for global growth, Xu said.\n\n\"There is no justification to the argument that China\u2019s economy is weighing down the global economy,\" said Xu. The theory that fluctuations in China\u2019s stock and currency markets in January subsequently led to volatility in U.S. and European stock markets \"overestimate China\u2019s capabilities; China does not have such a big spillover effect,\" he said.\n\nOvercapacity Cuts\n\nAs part of its structural reform, China\u2019s overhaul of state-owned enterprises and reduction of overcapacity in industries from iron and steel to coal production will not lead to massive layoffs, as local governments and companies have come up with various ways to cushion the blow, Xu said. China has set aside 100 billion yuan ($15 billion) to help displaced workers at state-owned enterprises, Li said in his work report.\n\nIn the last round of SOE reforms by then-premier Zhu Rongji following slower expansion in the 1990s, some 60,000 firms were closed and 40 million workers lost their jobs, according to government data.\n\nAnother difficult reform is smoothing out imbalances in the property market, he said.

To move money through the global banking system, conspirators allegedly disguised recipients as pet-supply and dress stores. When financial firms raised alarms, the group feigned shock, paid fines and opened new accounts. And in a twist that turned heads, it even hacked a security company that was supposed to detect its ruse.\n\n\"Wow,\" said Julie Conroy, a security specialist at payments researcher Aite Group. \"Shame on this firm for being a victim, because if you\u2019re in that position you know the bad guys are coming after you.\"\n\nThe allegations illustrate the challenge facing banks and credit-card processors already under heightened pressure to detect suspicious transactions and thwart money laundering. Big banks around the world have pledged to step up their efforts, in some cases while paying billions of dollars in fines for past failings.

But that being said, it\u2019s not as though others aren\u2019t trying to replicate it or are actively replicating these very steps.\"\n\nThe tactics for moving money were just one aspect of a larger crackdown Tuesday on cybersecurity breaches, including last year\u2019s massive theft of JPMorgan Chase & Co. customer data. At the center of the indictments is Gery Shalon -- a 31-year-old Israeli from the Republic of Georgia. Prosecutors said he used hacking as the backbone of a criminal conglomerate that ran illegal Internet casinos and elaborate pump-and-dump stock schemes. After a July arrest, the U.S. is seeking his extradition to New York for trial.

But using cards requires clearance from a network such as Visa Inc. or MasterCard Inc. and the customer\u2019s bank.\n\n\u2018Squeezing a Balloon\u2019\n\nProsecutors said Shalon and conspirators offered a solution. They allegedly set up a system that handled money for criminals while charging a fee on each transaction -- more than $18 million total. The group worked with \"corrupt international bank officials,\" and developed other strategies that relied on dogged creativity, according to the indictment. No officials were identified.\n\nFor example, to collect money from U.S. gamblers, Shalon and conspirators coded transactions so that it looked like payments went to online stores selling pet supplies and wedding dresses, according to prosecutors. When card networks spotted illicit payments, they imposed millions of dollars in penalties on banks that let transactions slip through. Shalon and conspirators allegedly pretended they were unaware or surprised, reimbursed the banks, then set up more accounts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like squeezing a balloon,\u201d said Aite\u2019s Conroy. \u201cYou squeeze them out of one part of the system but they will go and find opportunity somewhere else.\u201d\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world.

The hackers figured out which credit and debit cards the company used to detect bogus merchants, then blacklisted those card numbers from Shalon\u2019s network.\n\nKnowing Customers\n\nSecurity analysts said the case shows financial firms need to learn even more about their customers, including the merchants that accept their cards, and that regulators ought to consider changing rules to make it easier for firms to share information with each other about potential threats.\n\n\u201cYou have to know who you\u2019re doing business with,\" said Avivah Litan, a cybersecurity analyst at Gartner Inc. \u201cEveryone is subject to sophisticated data breaches, none of us are immune.

The U.S. Treasury Department last month said the island\u2019s passports are being used to facilitate financial crime.\n\n\u201cTo be blunt, we talk about places like St. Kitts as places where you go to escape from responsibilities,\u201d Christensen, an expert on tax havens, said by phone from London. \u201cSt. Kitts sells secrecy on the international market and, unsurprisingly, attracts all types of dirty money.\u201d\n\nGaining Citizenship\n\nErasmus Williams, press secretary for St. Kitts, didn\u2019t respond to phone calls or e-mailed questions about the Citizenship-By-Investment program.\n\nA woman who answered the phone at the Office of the Prime Minister said the program is \u201cnot a matter of buying passports, it\u2019s about gaining citizenship.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, no residency or visit is needed, just that $400,000 investment -- re-sellable after five years -- or a non-refundable $250,000 donation to the country, according to St. Kitts\u2019s official website.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t get the message the first time, the site repeats in bold print: \u201cNo personal visit required.\u201d\n\nStill, wealthy Chinese have a tough time buying in because government limits on money transfers stop them from sending more than $50,000 worth of cash overseas each year.\n\n\u201cThe processing agent in St. Kitts told me he feels bad for all of his Chinese clients,\u201d Ver said. \u201cThey have to reach out to all different friends and relatives and get them to all send the money in drips and drabs. Bitcoin solves all of that.\u201d\n\nAnonymous Ledger\n\nThat\u2019s because it was designed to be anonymous. While an online public ledger stores every single Bitcoin transaction, the entries don\u2019t include the names and addresses required for bank accounts.\n\nIn practical terms, a person in Beijing can buy bitcoins at home through BTC China, OKCoin or numerous other exchanges. With a few swipes on a smartphone, the money can then be beamed to St. Kitts with no government on Earth the wiser.\n\nThe U.S. lost its allure for Ver after he was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison after selling about 14 pounds of explosive without a license on the EBay auction site. The product, \u201cPest Control Report 2000,\u201d was basically a firecracker to scare birds away from cornfields, Ver says.\n\nLocked Up\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I didn\u2019t hurt anybody. I had nothing but happy customers and the U.S. government locked me in a cage because of that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I want nothing to do with those people. I don\u2019t want to support them. I want them out of my life.\u201d\n\nVer moved to Tokyo after finishing probation in 2006. He got his St. Kitts passport on Feb. 13, 2014, and abandoned his U.S. citizenship by the end of the month.\n\n\u201cI would have done it the same day if I could,\u201d he said. \u201cThey told me I had to have a one-week cooling-off period. They said, \u2018Did you know if you renounce citizenship, you won\u2019t be able to serve in the armed forces?\u2019 It was like, \u2018darn.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe U.S. is unusual in taxing its citizens no matter where they live. Recent laws requiring disclosure of foreign bank accounts has driven up the number of wealthy Americans looking to sever ties with home. A record 2,999 renounced their citizenship in 2013.\n\nAlthough Ver\u2019s computer parts business made him a millionaire by the time he was 25, the real money came after he bought tens of thousands of bitcoins in 2011. They cost about $1 each then. Today they trade at about $600, according to the CoinDesk price index.\n\nBitcoin Evangelist\n\nVer said he earned his moniker, Bitcoin Jesus, by telling anyone who would listen about bitcoin well before other venture capital companies paid any attention to the digital currency.\n\nOne of the people who got a dose of Ver\u2019s sermons was the agent who processed his application for citizenship, Paul Bilzerian. Bilzerian is a former corporate raider who moved to St. Kitts after long battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and two stints in prison for securities fraud and conspiracy to defraud the government of millions.\n\nThe two men bonded over the belief they\u2019d been targeted by U.S. authorities, according to Ver. Together, they started passportsforbitcoin.com in April, Ver said.\n\nBilzerian, who is one of several-dozen licensed government processers in St. Kitts, declined to comment in an e-mail.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nTheir website says a second passport insulates you from governments that intrude on citizen\u2019s lives. The site also has testimonials from Ver and Bilzerian\u2019s son, Dan, a 30-something professional poker player with millions of followers on Instagram, where he posts pictures of himself with half-naked women, along with his gun collection. He didn\u2019t respond to e-mailed questions forwarded through his press agent.\n\n\u201cI value freedom more than almost anything else and a second or third passport provides me insurance just in case the U.S. government decides to value security over freedom,\u201d Bilzerian\u2019s son writes on the passport website.", "date": "2014-06-15 00:00:00", "title": "\u2018Bitcoin Jesus\u2019 Calls Rich to Tax-Free Tropical Paradise"}

He proposed building computer servers attached to satellites, loading them with data about everyday bitcoin transactions, and then launching those satellites into space. As one of the core developers of the virtual currency, Garzik was able to attract the attention of venture capitalists, who have been eager to throw cash at all sorts of bitcoin startups this year. However, the fundraising efforts failed.\n\nOn Oct. 13, Garzik sent an e-mail to customers and partners, saying he\u2019d decided to place his startup, Dunvegan Space Systems, in a \u201cdeep freeze.\u201d The company was \u201cnowhere close to the necessary fundraising target,\u201d so it halted all \u201cspace-related marketing and operations,\u201d Garzik wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s look forward to the time when DSS is un-frozen, and we\u2019re getting back to lofting satellites and drones into space.\u201d\n\nA chill in bitcoin-related investments is not just affecting bizarre satellite-launching ventures. After an aggressive start to 2015 that entailed venture capitalists kicking $373 million into bitcoin startups in the first half of the year, growth slowed substantially in the third quarter, according to data from researcher CoinDesk. The $85 million in investments last quarter represents a relatively modest growth rate of 15 percent from a year earlier and a 41 percent drop from the previous quarter.\n\nOn Nov. 2, dozens of the most influential contributors to bitcoin\u2019s development will convene virtually on Bitcoin.com\u2019s Web forums as part of an event designed to answer questions about the digital currency\u2019s future. They\u2019ll have much to discuss.\n\nThe total amount of venture capital invested in bitcoin companies is expected to surpass $1 billion by the end of October, according to Barry Silbert, a bitcoin bull and co-founder of SecondMarket, which is being acquired by Nasdaq. But the next milestone may come slower as investors tread cautiously. \u201cIt is natural that VCs are waiting to see whether their previous investments have panned out before increasing investment,\u201d said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.\n\nSome of the early bets have not panned out. Buttercoin, a bitcoin marketplace that went through Y Combinator\u2019s tech incubator, closed its doors this year, along with several other startups, while many survivors have merged so they can continue operating. BitPay, a bitcoin payment processor backed by Founders Fund and other venture firms, cut staff in September, affecting nearly 30 employees and contractors. \u201cWe have decided to restructure our workforce to better align ourselves with the pace of growth of the wider bitcoin economy,\u201d Stephen Pair, BitPay chief executive officer, wrote in an e-mailed statement.\n\nBitcoin believers can be found among some of the highest-profile venture capitalists. Adam Draper\u2019s Boost VC has invested in numerous bitcoin startups, and his father, Tim, has promoted the digital currency as the future of money. \u201cOur Bitcoin companies are rocking, and there are lots of buyers and not many sellers of bitcoin out there,\u201d said Tim Draper, a founding partner of Draper Fisher Jurvetson. \u201cThe transformation is here.\u201d\n\nAndreessen Horowitz backed 21, which makes bitcoin computers. Bloomberg LP is an investor in Andreessen Horowitz. The firm declined to comment about its investments in bitcoin, and Adam Draper didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nA big source of the hard times for bitcoin startups is bitcoin itself. The price of the digital currency has declined 9.5 percent since the beginning of this year. Bitcoin Investment Trust, a publicly traded bitcoin fund created by Silbert, is down 35 percent since it listed in May. The hype has died down at online stores as well. After seeing huge growth in bitcoin sales last year, Web retailer Overstock.com said bitcoin transactions account for about 0.02 percent of sales this year, which is half of what they were in 2014.\n\nInvestors are now more interested in bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology, called the blockchain. It\u2019s a mechanism for quickly and accurately recording transactions in an online ledger, and it could have important applications in banking and e-commerce to facilitate faster bank transfers or international transactions. On Oct. 14, bitcoin startup Bitreserve changed its name to Uphold and switched its focus to letting people transact in any form of money or commodity they choose, using the blockchain. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pivoting of companies saying we want to build things for companies on the blockchain,\u201d said Michael Terpin, an investor in bitcoin who is backing more startups this year than he did in 2014.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nTerpin\u2019s faith hasn\u2019t wavered, and he said a slowdown isn\u2019t cause for alarm. \u201cThe rate of growth is slowing, and that\u2019s not a surprise,\u201d Terpin said. \u201cFor the most part, we are seeing a mild hiccup.\u201d He compared bitcoin to the dot-com bubble but said we aren\u2019t on the verge of bursting, at least not yet. \u201cNothing goes up forever,\u201d Terpin said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are in a 2001 crash moment in bitcoin. We are in the 1997 inflection point.\u201d\n\nGarzik is similarly committed to bitcoin. His satellite project has a potential customer who may place an $18 million order in March 2016, which could revive the company. In the meantime, Garzik is working on a new startup called Bloq, which is exploring ways for \u201cprofessionalizing the entire bitcoin ecosystem.\u201d He described it as \u201ca more\u2014ahem\u2014down-to-earth bitcoin company.\u201d", "date": "2015-10-26 00:00:00", "title": "The Bitcoin Startup Boom Comes Back Down to Earth"}
{"sourceurl": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-30/seven-reasons-cheap-oil-can-t-stop-renewables-now", "sourcename": "bloomberg", "response_body": "Oil prices have fallen by more than half since July. Just five years ago, such a plunge in fossil fuels would have put the renewable-energy industry on bankruptcy watch. Today: Meh.\n\nHere are seven reasons why humanity\u2019s transition to cleaner energy won\u2019t be sidetracked by cheap oil.\n\n1. The Sun Doesn't Compete With Oil\n\nOil is for cars; renewables are for electricity. The two don\u2019t really compete. Oil is just too expensive to power the grid, even with prices well below $50 a barrel.\n\nInstead, solar competes with coal, natural gas, hydro, and nuclear power. Solar, the newest to the mix, makes up less than 1 percent of the electricity market today but will be the world\u2019s biggest single source by 2050, according to the International Energy Agency. Demand is so strong that the biggest limit to installations this year may be the availability of panels.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t kill solar now if you wanted to,\u201d says Jenny Chase, the lead solar analyst with Bloomberg New Energy Finance in London.\n\n2. Electricity Prices Are Still Going Up\n\nThe real threat to renewables isn\u2019t cheap oil; it\u2019s cheap electricity. In the U.S., abundant natural gas has made power production exceedingly inexpensive. So why are electricity bills still going up?\n\nSource: Deutsche Bank. Data: EIA, Thomson Reuters\n\nFuel isn\u2019t the only component of the electricity bill. Consumers also pay to get the electricity from power plant to home. In recent years, those costs have soared. Annual investments in the grid increased fourfold since 1980, to $27 billion in 2010, according to a report by Deutsche Bank analyst Vishal Shah. That\u2019s driving bills higher and making rooftop solar attractive.\n\n3. Solar Prices Are Still Going Down\n\nYou may have seen this chart before. It\u2019s the most important chart. It shows the reason solar will soon dominate: It\u2019s a technology, not a fuel. As time passes, the efficiency of solar power increases and prices fall. Michael Park, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, has a term for the staggering price relationship between solar and fossil fuels: the Terrordome.\n\nSource: Bernstein Research. Data: EIA, CIA, World Bank, Bernstein analysis\n\nThe chart above shows the price of energy from different sources since the late 1940s. The extreme outlier is solar, which only recently entered the marketplace, at a very high price. Prices are falling so fast that solar will soon undercut even the cheapest fossil fuels, coal and natural gas. In the few places oil and solar compete directly, oil doesn\u2019t stand a chance.\n\nCase in point: Oil-rich Dubai just tripled its solar target for the year 2030, to 15 percent of the country\u2019s total power capacity. Dubai\u2019s government-owned utility this week awarded a $330 million contract for a solar plant that will sell some of the cheapest electricity in the world.\n\n4. Sales of Plug-Ins Are Doing Just Fine, Actually\n\nConventional wisdom says cheap oil is an existential threat to electric vehicles. It\u2019s been true in the past, notably when Congress retreated from funding EV research in the 1980s as oil prices tanked. Things are different now, and global sales of plug-ins rose by about a third last year, according to BNEF.\n\nSource: Tom Randall. Data: Electric Drive Transportation Association, Ward\u2019s Automotive Group, Bloomberg\n\nHere\u2019s why cheap oil won\u2019t stop electric vehicles:\n\nSince 2010 there\u2019s been no relationship between gasoline price and electric vehicle sales, according to BNEF analyst Alejandro Zamorano Cadavid. Electric cars are still in the early-adopter phase, and someone paying $100,000 for a Tesla doesn\u2019t care that gasoline costs a buck less per gallon. In Europe, gas taxes are so high that it makes the price of crude less important. If you\u2019re in Norway, and gas drops from $10 a gallon to $9 a gallon, electric cars are still a deal. In China, the government is stepping up support for electric vehicles. Pollution has become a serious problem, and the Chinese are getting serious about fixing it. Plug-in sales are soaring.\n\nElectric vehicles are moving like a Tesla: quietly, but with great acceleration. Let\u2019s bookmark this conversation for two years from now, when Chevy and Tesla plan to release the first affordable mass-market plug-ins with a range of 200+ miles per charge. At that point, the price of fuel might be a real consideration for car buyers, and at that point it\u2019s more likely to tip the scales toward EVs, not away from them.\n\n5. Pump Prices Haven't Dropped as Much as Oil Prices\n\nThey haven't changed at all in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand\n\nSource: Bernstein Research\n\nThere are a couple of interesting reasons why savings at the pump haven't kept pace with falling oil prices. First, a number of countries, including India and Indonesia, have used the price drop as cover to cut gasoline subsidies that were weighing down their budgets. Second, countries that include China have pocketed the savings from cheaper oil by increasing gasoline taxes to make up the difference.\n\nFossil-fuel subsidies outpace renewable-energy subsidies by a factor of 6 to 1. Reducing the subsidy gap is one of the cheapest ways to increase fuel efficiency and speed up the switch to cleaner energy. Expect similar moves as the rising toll of climate change pushes governments to take action.\n\n6. Oil Prices Won\u2019t Stay This Low Forever\n\nThe history of oil prices follows a golden rule: What goes down must come up. Goldman Sachs identified almost $1 trillion in investments in future oil projects that are no longer profitable with oil under $70 a barrel. American drillers are idling rigs faster than they have since 1991. Eventually, supply will shrink and prices will rise again.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nOil may never return to $100 a barrel, according to billionaire Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Al Saud. Even so, few experts foresee oil remaining at its current lows for more than a year or two. Unlike oil, the price of renewables is predictable and always going down. Solar power will be as cheap as, or cheaper than, electricity from the grid in as much as 80 percent of global markets by the end of 2017, according to Deutsche Bank's Shah.\n\n7. Global Investment in Clean Energy Keeps Flowing\n\nThe biggest question for renewables and the oil plunge is: How much does perception shape reality? Shares of solar and wind companies have been pulled down with oil prices. Will this artificial drag bleed into direct investments in energy projects?\n\nPreview This chart shows a conservative scenario. BNEF's more optimistic scenario is 8%-10% higher. Source: Bloomberg New Energy Finance\n\nNot likely. There are too many forces pulling in the opposite direction. Global investment in clean energy increased 16 percent last year, to $310 billion, according to data compiled by BNEF. The U.S. and China, the world's biggest emitters, reached a historic deal in November to rein in greenhouse gases. Pope Francis is preparing a papal encyclical on climate change, a letter to the world\u2019s bishops that will formalize the church\u2019s moral position on the issue for 1.2 billion Catholics. He may also convene a summit of the world\u2019s top religious leaders in advance of global climate talks in Paris in December.\n\nThose talks represent the world\u2019s last best chance to mitigate the damage from climate change. National policies to reduce carbon pollution would speed up the adoption of clean energy. Even in their absence, the global energy shift away from fossil fuels has begun, and we know how it will end.", "date": "2015-01-30 00:00:00", "title": "Seven Reasons Cheap Oil Can't Stop Renewables Now"}

Technology firms\u2019 weighting in MSCI Inc.\u2019s benchmark Chinese equity gauge will almost double to 26 percent by May, after a Nov. 12 review when overseas-listed firms from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Baidu Inc. become eligible for inclusion, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The change will affect investors with at least $400 billion of Chinese stock holdings and give the country a higher concentration of software companies than any other MSCI index worldwide.\n\nThe stock gauge\u2019s evolution is a sped-up version of what President Xi Jinping\u2019s government is trying to do for China\u2019s economy: boost the role of privately-owned technology and service businesses while downsizing state-run industrial and financial giants. Investors have already made clear which group they prefer, with U.S.-listed Chinese technology stocks valued at levels almost four times higher than the MSCI China gauge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a better and fairer representation of the China universe, which you don\u2019t really see and didn\u2019t really get in the past,\u201d said Frank Tian, a Hong Kong-based investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, which oversees $483 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nFinancial Weighting\n\nThe weighting of financial companies in the MSCI China gauge will fall to 34 percent from 41 percent, with energy, industrials and utilities also declining, Goldman Sachs said in a Oct. 23 report. The changes may trigger $78 billion of net buying, the New York-based bank estimated. About $1.6 trillion tracks the MSCI Emerging Market Index, and China makes up about 25 percent of those positions, according to Chia Chin-ping, a managing director at the index compiler.\n\nMSCI said in January that companies listed outside their home market should be included in national benchmark equity gauges. The additions are being phased in as part of the index compiler\u2019s six-monthly reviews in November and in May. As many as 14 companies might be added to the MSCI China index, according to a simulation of the change, which also affects companies from Hong Kong, the Netherlands and Israel.\n\nWhile China\u2019s government doesn\u2019t publish a breakdown of the technology sector\u2019s contribution to gross domestic product, official data show the growing importance of service industries, which make up more than half the economy and expanded at a 8.4 percent pace in the first nine months of 2015. That compares with 6 percent growth in the industrial and construction sectors.\n\nIndex Drivers\n\nThe new MSCI China measure will be skewed toward companies that are shielded from the nation\u2019s slowing economy, according to Adrian Mowat, the chief Asian and emerging-market equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re worried about certain parts of the Chinese economy like steel and cement,\u201d Mowat said. \u201cBut for the stock market, it\u2019s not an issue because they\u2019re a tiny percentage of the benchmark. What matters is what\u2019s happening with e-commerce, online gaming, etc. That\u2019s the driver of the index.\u201d\n\nEarnings at financial companies in the CSI 300 Index are projected to climb 16 percent in the next 12 months, compared with 28 percent for technology shares, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., the first of the nation\u2019s big lenders to report third-quarter earnings, said profit increased just 1 percent from a year earlier. Alibaba\u2019s net income, excluding one-time items, climbed about 36 percent over the same period as sales topped analysts\u2019 estimates. Baidu\u2019s third-quarter revenue jumped 36 percent.\n\nLosing Bets\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nFor all the optimism toward Chinese technology companies, Alibaba and Baidu, the two biggest projected additions to the MSCI gauge, have been losing bets in 2015 on concern that slower economic growth will hurt sales. Alibaba has also been dragged down by government scrutiny of counterfeits in its online marketplace, with the American depositary receipts slumping 21 percent this year. Chinese tech shares in the U.S., which trade at a weighted average of 37 times reported earnings, are both more expensive and more volatile than the MSCI China gauge.\n\n\u201cThose are growth stocks, so definitely by nature the high growth is high volatility,\u201d said Paul Chan, the Hong Kong-based chief investment officer for Asia excluding Japan at Invesco Ltd., which oversees $776 billion globally. \u201cBut hopefully they will increase return.\u201d\n\nMarket Opening\n\nMost of the other potential new entrants have done better than Alibaba and Baidu, with JD.Com Inc. jumping 19 percent this year and NetEase Inc. surging 43 percent. A Bloomberg gauge of U.S.-listed Chinese companies is up 9.1 percent in 2015, compared with a 5.7 percent drop in the MSCI China index.\n\nThe overhaul still leaves mainland-listed equities out in the cold, with MSCI deciding in June to hold off on adding them to indexes because of their inaccessibility to foreign investors. It also means the MSCI China measure will be more technology-heavy than mainland gauges: the industry makes up just 7.3 percent of the large-cap CSI 300 Index.\n\nFor JPMorgan Asset Management\u2019s Richard Titherington, next month\u2019s changes are an intermediate step as China opens up its capital markets.\n\n\u201cChinese equities are going to become an ever increasing part of the benchmark indexes,\u201d said Titherington, the chief investment officer for emerging markets and Asia Pacific equities at JPMorgan Asset. \u201cThe big ADR listings, particularly the well-known Internet companies, are obviously an important part of the Chinese investment theme and therefore should be represented in benchmarks.\u201d", "date": "2015-10-29 00:00:00", "title": "Xi\u2019s Dream for a High-Tech China Is Becoming a Reality in Stocks"}

Still, inflation below target makes cutting public debt difficult, according to the Washington-based lender.\n\n\u201cA lasting solution to the debt overhang problem is not possible without higher growth and moderate inflation,\u201d the IMF said in the Fiscal Monitor. \u201cThis underscores the need to continue monetary stimulus and accelerate structural reforms to catalyze growth.\u201d\n\nFastest Growth\n\nThe U.S. will expand 3.1 percent this year, the fastest among major developed economies, Japan is expected to grow 1 percent and the euro area is projected to advance 1.5 percent, the IMF said Tuesday.\n\nEmerging market and low-income developing economies might be hurt by surprises about the expected interest rate increase in the U.S., the Fiscal Monitor report said.\n\nThe euro area needs to simplify fiscal governance, while Japan needs a medium-term plan that would include targeted stimulus during economic slowdowns, according to the IMF.\n\nIn China, a further shift toward domestic consumption and lower reliance on credit and investment would curb the risks of a \u201cfinancial disruption or a sharp slowdown,\u201d according to the report.", "date": "2015-04-15 00:00:00", "title": "Low Oil Prices Cost Exporters More Than Aid Importers, IMF Says"}

Its predicament, security experts say, shows how hacking has become a danger to virtually all companies regardless of size, prominence, or perceived vulnerability.\n\n\"How many of the Fortune 500 are hacked right now? The answer: 500. They all have security breaches, big or small,\" said Mikko Hypponen, Chief Research Officer at Helsinki-based cyber-security company F-Secure Oyj. \"If you have a big enough infrastructure, you won\u2019t be able to secure all of it.\"\n\nSustained Attack\n\nTalkTalk\u2019s crisis began on Wednesday, when it was hit by a \"significant and sustained\" attack on its website that might have compromised banking and credit-card data, as well as personal information. It later received a ransom demand from attackers it didn\u2019t identify, who wanted payment in exchange for relinquishing customer data.\n\nSo far relatively few of the highest-profile hacks, like the 2014 crisis at Target Corp. and a recent assault on customers of T-Mobile US Inc., have targeted U.K. or European companies, and their response has been correspondingly restrained. In its most recent global information security survey, consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers found almost a quarter of North American companies it surveyed spend more than $5 million a year on cyber-security, compared with about 19 percent in Europe.\n\nThe British government is concerned that U.K. firms are very vulnerable to attacks both from criminal groups looking for financial gain and state-sponsored cyber-spies, according to a senior security official who asked not to be identified discussing a private matter. As a result it\u2019s trying to upgrade investigative and intelligence capabilities without creating a moral hazard that would discourage companies from taking steps to protect itself, the official said.\n\nPotential Vulnerabilities\n\nCompanies seeking to avoid becoming the next TalkTalk, Target or T-Mobile must contend with a bewildering array of potential vulnerabilities within their own systems and those of vendors and customers. The Target hack, which resulted in the theft of millions of credit-card numbers, was reported to have begun with a supplier of heating and air-conditioning units that had access to Target\u2019s systems.\n\nTo make matters more complicated, only a small proportion of breaches prove to be serious threats -- and \"finding the needle in the needle stack that could really hurt you\" is an enormous challenge, said Richard Turner, who heads operations for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at security firm FireEye Inc., which alerted Target to its hack. The problem will only grow as devices from refrigerators to lighting systems get Internet connections of their own as part of the broader move toward an \"Internet of Things\" -- each one its own potential point of access.\n\nAnd even a robust security system can be defeated by a careless employee who opens the wrong attachment or plugs a USB key infected with malware into an office computer.\n\nOverblown Threat?\n\nBanks and other companies that handle financial flows and detailed personal data need to be especially vigilant, for obvious reasons. A 2014 hack at JPMorgan Chase & Co. used stolen login details to access a server that didn\u2019t require \"two-factor authentication,\" or a one-time code generated with a physical device or sent by text message, for entry. From there, attackers were able to access data on millions of households.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nTo be sure, not all cyber-security experts are convinced that companies routinely face catastrophic threats from hackers. It\u2019s in the interest of security companies and consultants to overstate risks and their ability to respond to them, said Ross Anderson, a professor of computer science at the University of Cambridge. For the most part, \"cyber-criminals do volume petty crime and take care to stay below the thresholds\" that would attract a significant law-enforcement response, he said -- an annoyance to companies, but not an existential challenge.\n\nThere\u2019s some evidence that the latest high-profile attack was less masterfully executed than it might have first appeared. TalkTalk over the weekend told customers that it yielded only partial credit-card numbers, and that fewer customers than it originally thought were affected.\n\nTalkTalk rivals Sky Plc and Liberty Global Plc declined to comment on their\n\nsecurity arrangements. EE, the largest UK mobile operator, said in a statement\n\nthat no customers were affected by the incident at TalkTalk, and that it has\n\n\"robust security measures in place\" to safeguard data, as did Vodafone.\n\nThe real risks of cyber-hacking may only become clear if and when critical infrastructure -- like power plants and water grids -- comes into the cross-hairs for attack by sophisticated groups.\n\nSome companies or governments \"are certainly going to come up short if subject to a real significant and sustained attack,\" said Robin King, CEO of U.K. -based cyber-defense company Deep Secure. \"I do not think we have yet seen the tip of the iceberg.\"", "date": "2015-10-25 00:00:00", "title": "TalkTalk Attack Shows Firms Have No Place to Hide From Hackers"}

The number tripled to 3,000 in 2013 from the previous year, Internal Revenue Service data shows.\n\nWhile Brynner, the star of \u201cThe Magnificent Seven,\u201d renounced his American citizenship in Bern following a dispute with the IRS, tougher asset-disclosure rules being introduced in July are prompting more of the estimated 6 million Americans living overseas to weigh giving up their passports. The appeal of U.S. citizenship for expatriates dimmed further as 106 Swiss banks prepare to turn over account data on American clients to avoid prosecution for helping tax evaders.\n\n\u201cI feel caught in the battle between the government and the banks,\u201d said John Annen, a 46-year-old American mathematician who has lived for more than decade in Switzerland. \u201cThe U.S. government is the biggest threat to my style of living.\u201d\n\nThe U.S., the only nation in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that taxes citizens wherever they reside, stepped up the search for tax dodgers after UBS AG, Switzerland\u2019s biggest bank, paid a $780 million penalty in 2009 and handed over data on about 4,700 accounts.\n\nTax Problem\n\nWhile Zurich-based Annen said his American citizenship makes him an \u201cunwanted customer\u201d of Swiss banks, he hasn\u2019t considered relinquishing his passport.\n\nThat makes him an exception. More than two-thirds of 400 U.S. expatriates surveyed in November by Zurich-based deVere Group said they had considered giving up their passports.\n\nBanks in Switzerland, the largest cross-border financial center with $2.2 trillion of assets, have discovered that thousands of their clients have dual U.S.-Swiss citizenship, obliging them to make voluntary disclosures, said Matthew Ledvina, a U.S. tax lawyer at Anaford AG in Zurich.\n\n\u201cThose banks have been checking through accounts and informing clients they have a big tax problem,\u201d said Ledvina. \u201cThe number of people renouncing their citizenship will probably rise as the banks enforce U.S. tax rules.\u201d\n\nRisk Evaluation\n\nThe U.S. has allowed some Swiss banks seeking to avoid prosecution for handling undeclared American money a two-month extension until the end of June to deliver account data.

The U.S. accounting costs for individuals opting for expatriation are typically about $4,000 per year, he said.\n\n\u201cFor every person who has actually given up their citizenship there are 100 Americans abroad who are throwing up their hands at their tax situation,\u201d said David Kuenzi, founder of Madison, Wisconsin-based Thun Financial Advisors. \u201cIts not about people not wanting to pay their taxes -- it\u2019s about the infuriating difficulty of paying your taxes.\u201d", "date": "2014-05-11 00:00:00", "title": "Brynner\u2019s Tax Spat Augurs Rush to Give Up U.S. Passports"}

Saudi Aramco, the state-run oil company, offered Asian customers the biggest discount on its benchmark crude in at least 14 years for January sales. It also cut prices for all grades it sells to U.S. refineries.\n\nSaudi Arabia led OPEC in opposing calls by other members including Venezuela to reduce supply.

Underneath the stable forecast, however, the IMF depicts a global economy being reshaped by swings in currency markets and the drop in oil prices.\n\nThe Washington-based crisis lender cut its U.S. expansion forecast by 0.5 percentage point to 3.1 percent, still the fastest among major developed economies. The Japan growth outlook increased to 1 percent from 0.6 percent and the euro area is projected to expand 1.5 percent as weakening currencies provide a \u201cwelcome boost,\u201d the IMF said.\n\nEmerging markets are showing their own mixed forecasts, with growth projected to slow to 4.3 percent from 4.6 percent in 2014, the fifth straight annual decline and the same forecast as in January.\n\nThe figures show India will grow more quickly this year than China for the first time since 1999, according to data on the fund\u2019s website. The IMF predicts India will expand at a 7.5 percent rate, up 1.2 percentage points from the January forecast. India is benefiting from policy reforms by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government, a pickup in business investment and lower energy prices, the fund said.\n\nChina \u2018Excesses\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, China is expected to grow 6.8 percent this year, unchanged from January\u2019s forecast. The world\u2019s second-biggest economy is slowing as \u201cprevious excesses in real estate, credit and investment continue to unwind,\u201d the IMF said.\n\nBrazil will contract 1 percent in 2015, compared with projected growth of 0.3 percent at the start of the year, the IMF said. In cutting its forecast, the fund cited \u201cstubbornly weak\u201d private-sector sentiment, fallout from the investigation into allegations of corruption at Petroleo Brasileiro SA, and efforts to curb public spending and inflation.\n\nThe IMF projects an even deeper contraction in Russia this year than it did in January, with output expected to shrink 3.8 percent.\n\nWhile the 50 percent drop in oil prices since June is hurting Russia, the fund estimates the decline will boost global output between 0.5 percent and 1 percent by 2016, depending on how it\u2019s passed through to consumers and businesses. Uncertainty has increased about the path of oil prices, the fund said, pointing to volatility levels implied by derivatives markets.\n\nWinners, Losers\n\n\u201cLarge movements in relative prices, whether exchange rates or the price of oil, create winners and losers,\u201d said Olivier Blanchard, the IMF\u2019s chief economist.\n\nThe IMF said short-term downside risks to its outlook include a faster-than-expected rebound in oil prices that undercuts gains for households and firms. A further \u201csizable\u201d strengthening of the dollar could hurt holders of U.S.- denominated debt in emerging markets, while the threat of low inflation or falling prices in advanced economies remains an \u201cimportant concern,\u201d the IMF said.\n\nAs negotiations for Greek economic reforms drag on, a further \u201ccrisis\u201d that would unsettle financial markets can\u2019t be ruled out, Blanchard said at a briefing Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAn exit from the euro would be extremely costly for Greece, would be extremely painful,\u201d he said, after stating the IMF is working on and hopes to come to an agreement with Greece. That said, \u201cthe rest of the euro zone is in a better position to deal with a Greek exit\u201d than it has been previously, Blanchard said.\n\nDollar\u2019s Rise\n\nThe greenback has appreciated 6.8 percent this year after an 11 percent jump in 2014, according to the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index. Blanchard said Tuesday that the currency\u2019s move has given a net boost to the world economy, and the report contained IMF simulations showing exchange-rate shifts since August may boost global output by 0.5 percent by next year.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day.

At the National People\u2019s Congress, Premier Li Keqiang said the government would fight pollution like it has fought poverty.\n\nUnlike the fight against poverty, the struggle against pollution comes at a cost in terms of growth. Fewer volts from coal-fired power stations, slower growth in car ownership, and reduced production of steel and cement are all necessary steps to clear China\u2019s smog. All of them also threaten to dent industrial output.\n\nTo estimate the extent of the impact, we looked at data from the World Bank on PM2.5 levels and growth in industrial output across 155 countries from 2005 to 2010. The results confirm a strong positive correlation, suggesting that absent a significant investment in abatement measures or a shift in China\u2019s industrial structure, clean air can only come at the expense of shrinking output.\n\nIndustrial Output Reduction Versus PM2.5 Targets\n\nBloomberg Briefs\n\nHow big is the hit? China\u2019s government is targeting a PM2.5 level of 35 micrograms per cubic meter. In 2014, the level was about 60. Our estimate suggests that without any changes in industrial structure or other abatement efforts, getting there would require a reduction in industrial output of as much as 20 percent.\n\nBloomberg Briefs\n\nGetting down to the international clean air standard would be even tougher. The level recommended by the World Health Organization is 10 micrograms per cubic meter. Absent other measures, that would mean taking China\u2019s industrial output down 40 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s not necessary for China to hit the target solely by cutting output. Shifting the energy mix and raising standards for power plants and autos could bring down emissions at a lower economic cost. The announcement this week that Beijing would replace coal-fired power plants in the capital in favor of gas-powered stations shows the scope for improvement.\n\nThe most important market news of the day.

Rebalancing away from industry and toward services, and within industry from heavy-polluting steel and cement toward cleaner high-end manufacturing is already under way. To give one example of how effective that can be, production of information and communications technology equipment is 20 times more energy efficient than production of steel.\n\nStill, shifts in the energy mix and the industrial structure take place over a number of years. Based on Bloomberg\u2019s estimates of monthly GDP, China\u2019s growth is already below Li\u2019s 7 percent target for the year. If China\u2019s government wants to make rapid progress on clearing the smog, that can only come at the expense of further clouding the outlook on growth.\n\nThis post is courtesy of Bloomberg Intelligence Economics.", "date": "2015-03-26 00:00:00", "title": "Cutting China\u2019s Smog Will Come at a Massive Cost"}

Gore speaks at the Bloomberg New Energy Finance The Future of Energy Summit 2015 in New York. (Source: Bloomberg)\n\nIf you go far enough left or right on the American political spectrum, you end up in the same place: trashing utilities for trying to kill the solar-power revolution.\n\nIf you\u2019re Al Gore, former Democratic vice-president and climate change activist, you blast Big Power for \u201cusing the atmosphere as their sewage infrastructure\u201d to suck up carbon emissions and trying to shut down competition. The industry is waging a \u201cwar on solar,\u201d he told investors Monday at the Bloomberg New Energy Finance conference in New York City.\n\nIf you\u2019re Debbie Dooley, a national Tea Party activist who says state laws discriminate against residential solar, you tell the same audience that Americans want \u201cenergy freedom\u201d and not \u201cgovernment-sanctioned monopolies\u201d that tell consumers where they must buy power.\n\nIn back-to-back speeches, the political Odd Couple struck surprisingly similar tones on clean energy\u2019s future, even if Gore dwelled on renewables\u2019 role in avoiding catastrophic global warming while Dooley didn\u2019t use the words \u201cclimate change\u201d at all, focusing on consumer choice.\n\n\u201cThis is a battle that we will win,\u201d said Dooley, a board member of the National Tea Party Patriots group. \u201cI am literally floored with the response I have been getting from conservatives with the right message.\u201d\n\n\u2018Struggle\u2019\n\nOnly minutes earlier, Gore told the audience that \u201cwe are going to win this struggle and the business community is leading the way.\u201d He cited investments in wind, solar and battery technology as transformational to the energy business in the U.S.\n\nThe fact these two forces from opposite ends of the spectrum are coming together reflects a maturing in the environmental debate, with a search on for leaders who can deliver the message to different communities, said Andy Hoffman, director of the Institute for Global Sustainable Enterprise at the University of Michigan.\n\n\u201cThe issue of climate change has to be framed in a way that it\u2019s salient to people, and it has to come from people they trust,\u201d Hoffman said at the conference. \u201cThe Green Tea Party is framing it around freedom. The whole challenge is how we make it something that resonates with people.\u201d\n\nConsensus Forming?\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nIf there\u2019s a consensus forming, it\u2019s still hard to tell in Washington, where the new Republican majority in Congress has vowed to block President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental agenda. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from coal-rich Kentucky, has urged states to refuse to implement proposed rules on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. McConnell called Obama\u2019s proposal \u201cjob-killing and likely illegal,\u201d according to a statement March 31.\n\nYet public opinion surveys suggest Gore and Dooley may be on to something. Nationally, 77 percent of U.S. adults supported funding research for renewable energy, while 61 percent said utilities should be required to generate some power from clean-energy sources, according to a survey by Yale and Utah State universities released last week.\n\nThose numbers held steady from the Deep South to liberal Massachusetts, said the report, which was based on interviews last year with 13,000 people.\n\nBy contrast, opinions on whether global warming is happening were more polarized, with Republican-leaning regions more skeptical than Democratic areas.\n\nGeorgia Work\n\nDooley, chairwoman of the Atlanta Tea Party chapter, joined with Democratic-leaning environmental groups two years ago, defeating a Georgia proposal to levy a fee on solar-panel owners for their use of the electric grid.\n\nIn Florida, she\u2019s pushing a ballot initiative that would allow individual homeowners and businesses to sell their solar power directly to tenants and neighbors, a right now reserved for electric companies. Utilities have opposed those measures, saying they risk losing income needed to keep the grid stable for all consumers.\n\nDooley said she doesn\u2019t mention climate change in her arguments to fellow conservatives, since the words can \u201cshut down the conversation.\u201d She\u2019s found big government a much better target.\n\n\u201cSolar equals independence -- solar equals freedom,\u201d she said. \u201cTea Party activists don\u2019t like strong centralized units. There\u2019s nothing more centralized than a utility, than the government telling you what power to buy.\u201d\n\nGore sounded like he was reading off the same script.\n\n\u201cPeople want their own opportunity to shape their own future, and renewable energy is part of that,\u201d Gore said. \u201cThere is a war on solar with these legacy utilities, and coal companies using their historic political power, campaign contributions and lobbying to pass the most ridiculous laws and tax the people who want to put solar panels on their roof.\u201d", "date": "2015-04-13 00:00:00", "title": "Al Gore Joins Tea Party in Battle Against Utilities"}

The government also abandoned its trade target, underscoring the degree of uncertainty about prospects for global growth.

Zhou broke months of silence in a February Caixin magazine interview, saying there\u2019s no basis for a continued yuan depreciation.

Its total area of approximately seven square kilometers would make it the third smallest sovereign state in the world, after the Vatican and Monaco.\n\nWhere is Liberland?\n\nIt's sandwiched between Croatia and Serbia on the western bank of the Danube River. On some maps, this area is referred to as \u201cGornja Siga.\u201d\n\nSo isn\u2019t it part of Croatia or Serbia?\n\nNot according to the founders. When the former Yugoslavia was split into new countries this small patch of land was forgotten about. Neither Croatia nor Serbia claimed it, making it a \u201cterra nullius\u201d or no man\u2019s land.\n\nWhat is a micronation anyway?\n\nA micronation is an entity that claims to be an independent nation, but is not officially recognized by world governments or major international organizations. Micronations are different from other kinds of social communes because they make a formal claim of sovereignty over a physical territory.\n\nWho is in charge?\n\nThe current president is Eurosceptic politician Jedlicka, 31, a member of the Czech Republic's Conservative Party of Free Citizens. Despite abstaining from Liberland\u2019s first presidential election, he was still elected by the two other founding members, one of whom is his girlfriend, and now the country\u2019s first lady.\n\nWhy was Liberland founded?\n\nAccording to the founders the objective is to build a country where honest people can prosper with minimal interference from a centralized government. \u201cWe need more countries like Hong Kong, Singapore and Monaco, especially in Europe,\u201d Jedlicka says. \u201cWe really needed another tax heaven, not tax haven.\u201d\n\nSo there won\u2019t be any taxes?\n\nAll taxes will be voluntary, and the nation\u2019s services - such as power, healthcare and waste disposal - will be run either by private enterprises or through crowdfunding campaigns.\n\nThe flag of Liberland\n\nWhat is Liberland hoping to achieve?\n\nQuite simply to have Liberland recognized by already-established nations as a sovereign state, paving the way for what the founders are calling a \u201cEuropean Singapore.\u201d To do this Jedlicka is appointing ambassadors from Liberland to countries all over the globe to drum up support for the idea.\n\nHas it actually established embassies in other nations?\n\nAccording to Jedlicka, Liberland has established embassies in several countries including the U.S., the U.K., France and the Czech Republic. He plans to open embassies in \u201ca hundred more countries by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nIs it even legal?\n\nLiberland is attempting to use the homestead principle, which states that unclaimed and undeveloped land can be legally claimed by any group willing to develop it. But some legal experts have stated that even though the land may appear unclaimed, it is most probably already part of Serbia.\n\nIs anyone actually living in Liberland?\n\nNot yet. Croatian border police are arresting anyone who sets foot in Liberland. However, this has not deterred members of the Liberland Settlers Association, which attempts to reach it on a daily basis and often clashes with local police in the process.\n\nWhat is the Liberland Settlement Association?\n\nThe Liberland Settlement Association (LSA) is an NGO based in Serbia, funded by the Liberland Settlement Corp. It is made up primarily of volunteers who attempt to maintain an active presence on Liberland to help it become a recognized country.\n\nSo what is the Liberland Settlement Corp.?\n\nAccording to CEO Niklas Nikolassen, the Liberland Settlement Corp. (LSC) \u201cis a group of liberty-minded investors who are funding the LSA.\u201d The corporation, based in Switzerland, has a claim on 80,000 square meters of Liberland and is hoping that the actions of the LSA will help Liberland achieve recognition as a sovereign state and thus make the land valuable.\n\nInvesting in the World's Newest \"Country\"\n\nHow many people will be able to live there if it\u2019s recognized?\n\nLiberland has already received almost 400,000 applications for citizenship, however only around 45,000 of these are considered to be serious. According to Jedlicka there will probably be a total of 30,000-40,000 Liberlandians, not all of whom will actually live in Liberland.\n\nHow are you supposed to run a country through crowd funding?\n\nLiberland's government says it has already raised over $45,000 through crowdfunding on it's website, where they take donations in both regular currency and Bitcoin. This has paid for government offices in Praque and Serbia, a personal assistant for the president and his recent trips to the G-7 in Germany and Freedom Fest in the U.S.\n\n(This story was corrected to say the corporation's claim within Liberland is 80,000 square meters.)", "date": "2015-07-21 00:00:00", "title": "Inside \u2018Liberland,\u2019 the Place of No Taxes Where Crowdfunding Rules"}

The deals underscore the rise of messaging apps, which smartphone users worldwide are increasingly using to communicate, rather than paying for text messages.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly competitive market, and a new era for these kinds of transactions and financing levels,\u201d said Tango co-founder Eric Setton, who added that the company has received takeover offers and chose to remain independent. \u201cAlibaba was very understanding that we wanted to keep leading the company.\u201d\n\nU.S. Investments\n\nAlibaba contributed $215 million in the round, with the remaining $65 million from existing investors, which include Qualcomm Ventures and DFJ.\n\nThe Hangzhou, China-based e-commerce company has taken other stakes in U.S. companies in the past few months. In October, Alibaba led a $206 million investment in ShopRunner, a members-only site that aggregates offers from retail partners, and a $50 million investment in Quixey, a mobile-application search engine.\n\nA stake in a messaging app may also help Alibaba on its home turf. Tencent Holdings Ltd., operator of the WeChat messaging service that is dominant in China, has been moving to compete with Alibaba by adding services including shopping and gaming.\n\n\u201cTango has exhibited tremendous growth because of its unique approach to combine free communications, social and content,\u201d Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joe Tsai said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cThey have a disruptive way of looking at the mobile and messaging opportunity.\u201d\n\nBefore WhatsApp\n\nThe terms of the deal were negotiated before Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp became public last month, according to the people with knowledge of the matter. Tango stuck with the original agreement, rather than negotiating a higher valuation, the people said.\n\nSetton, who is also Tango\u2019s chief technology officer, and Ashley Zandy, a spokeswoman for Alibaba, declined to comment on valuation or the timing of deal talks.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s minority holdings have occasionally turned into acquisitions. The company last month offered to buy the shares of AutoNavi Holdings Ltd. that it didn\u2019t already own in a deal valuing the digital mapping service at about $1.6 billion.\n\nAlibaba on March 16 said it decided to start its IPO process in the U.S. Investment banks value the company at as much as $200 billion, making it the second-biggest Internet company behind Google Inc. based on market value. Listing in the U.S. \u201cwill make us a more global company and enhance the company\u2019s transparency,\u201d Alibaba has said.\n\n$367 Million\n\nWith the new financing, Tango will have raised a total of $367 million. The company, which was founded in 2009, plans to use the new funds to expand globally and attract engineers, Setton said. The company also wants to bring in new gaming content.\n\nTango makes money by sharing revenue from the games played on its platform and through advertising. The company has more than doubled revenue in the last three months, Setton said, without disclosing underlying numbers.\n\n\u201cAlibaba was incredibly supportive of the vision that we outlined and they have a culture that puts founders at the forefront of their organization,\u201d he said. As the Chinese company goes through its IPO, \u201clearning from an investor about their growth trajectory might be very relevant for us in the future,\u201d he said.", "date": "2014-03-20 00:00:00", "title": "Alibaba-Led Funding Said to Value Tango at More Than $1B"}

The two nations will publish investments and deals worth a \u201chuge\u201d amount of money, including on nuclear power, Zhang Ji, assistant minister of commerce, said last week in Beijing. EDF will still have to make a final investment decision.\n\nThe U.K. government says new nuclear plants are a crucial part of the energy mix as Britain plans to cut carbon emissions while securing predictable electricity supplies. With construction costs estimated at 24.5 billion pounds ($37.9 billion) by the European Commission and bolstered by U.K. subsidies at twice the current wholesale power price, opponents have described Hinkley as \u201cthe most expensive object on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a very, very, very, very expensive piece of kit even in the context of nuclear power, and therefore it\u2019s hard to see that it\u2019s value for money,\u201d Peter Atherton, a utilities analyst at Jefferies in London, said in an interview. \u201cThe economics don\u2019t work for the private sector and the state always underpins the economics of nuclear power throughout the world.\u201d\n\nFinal Decision\n\nEDF, the world\u2019s biggest operator of reactors, and the U.K. agreed two years ago that Hinkley will get 92.50 pounds per megawatt-hour of power for as long as 35 years. That\u2019s competitive with new-build gas and renewable projects, and will give it a rate of return of 10 percent, according to the company.\n\nConstruction on the third-generation nuclear plant in Flamanville Photographer: Christophe Ena/AP Photo\n\nEDF\u2019s U.K. unit will shoulder all the construction costs associated with building Hinkley Point C and no costs will fall on the tax payer, it said Friday by e-mail.\n\n\u201cEverybody looks at economics of this project and many people believe there are cheaper opportunities to secure power generation capacity,\u201dsaid Roland Vetter, head of research at CF Partners U.K. LLP, a London-based trader and adviser, said in a phone interview.\n\nSince the deal on power prices, the utility has been negotiating with China General Nuclear Power Corp. and China National Nuclear Corp. over the size of their stakes in Hinkley, which was also the subject to a 10-month competition probe by the European Commission. The long-delayed project was originally planned to start in 2017, a deadline that has since been pushed to 2023, with EDF Chief Executive Officer Jean-Bernard Levy signaling further delays in September.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t bank on the timeline.,\u201d Lakis Athanasiou, a utilities analyst at Agency Partners LLP, said by phone from London. \u201cHinkley is highly unlikely to be finished by 2025 and any other reactors will be beyond 2030.\u201d\n\nOsborne\u2019s Sweetener\n\nTo accelerate the deal, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne pledged a loan guarantee of 2 billion pounds for construction of the plant, during a visit to Beijing last month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve invested a lot of time and effort and it\u2019s an important part of the mix,\u201d U.K. Energy Secretary Amber Rudd said Thursday in an interview.\n\nNuclear power will only become more important for the U.K. in the next decade as the nation debates closing all its 12 coal-fired power plants by 2023 to combat global warming. EDF\u2019s 1.2-gigawatt Sizewell B plant is the only one of the U.K.\u2019s 15 reactors scheduled to generate beyond 2023, and with Britain facing a squeeze on supplies, Rudd\u2019s main job is to ensure enough new generation gets built to replace retiring plants.\n\nEDF\u2019s talks with the Chinese also include plans for further new plants at\n\nSizewell and Bradwell, with the latter potentially incorporating Chinese\n\ntechnology.\n\nHigh Standards\n\n\u201cThe Chinese can come and engage with us, but it is our regulations, our high standards that they will have to live up with,\u201d Rudd told reporters last week when asked about reactor safety concerns.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day.
